I recently noticed something worrying: I have held many intellectual positions in my life - and the time I took them up was often near their peak of salience and buzziness.

* Atheism (2006)
* Socialism (2009)
* Feminism (2013)
* Longtermism (2021) 

<br> 

This doesn't strictly disqualify me, for reasons I model below. But it does suggest that I am not doing enough from first principles.

<br> 

## Trying on hats



## Endogenous model of hearing arguments



## Also 

* Ahead of the curve on vegetarianism (2006). First vegan in my entire extended social circle.
* Slightly ahead of the curve on AI (2016)
* Bayes
* Anti-woke (2014)
