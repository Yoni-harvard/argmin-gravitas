The duration and depth of disagreement among philosophers - 2000 years, on pretty much everything - is funny. Why are we surprised by the failure?

I think we care because a particular metaphilosophy is frustrated by persistent disagreement. Call the following set of claims the _Tacit Analytic Metaphilosophy_:

conceptual realism: concepts have one true definition.

1. _Metaphilosophical realism_: (Suitably sharpened) philosophical questions have one objective answer. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>
2. _Metaphilosophical naturalism_: "Philosophy is just one part of the empirical attempt to understand Nature." <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>
3. _Metaphilosophical optimism_: The effort to obtain answers to these questions is both possible and important.
4. _Metaphilosophical idealism_: The context of discovery of philosophy is not relevant to its context of justification. 

And call the denial of (1) _pluralism_ or _relativism_; the denial of (2) _anti-realism_ or _humanism_; the denial of (3) _quietism_; and the denial of (4) historicism.

There's a clear tension between (2) and (4): how can it be the case that philosophy is just another natural phenomenon, _and_ that it (or its justification) float free of particular causal histories?

The sensible reply is that (4) is a normative claim: _of course_ all kinds of cognitive bias and personal idiosyncracy are powerful factors in the development of a philosophical view, but it's irrational and counterproductive to focus on that, because there seems to be nothing to say about such factors - certainly nothing polite.

How common is this view? The PhilPapers survey (of mainly Anglophone philosophers) find
