		The taste of the coffee, my satisfaction at its flavor, the feeling of the warm cup in my hand — while these are immediate facts with which I am acquainted, they reach back into a dark wilderness of facts that I will never come to know... Where am I, that I have such a poor view of things? And what sort of thing am I that both my outside and my inside are so obscure?”

A popular method for finding things out is introspection, first-person reflection on your current mental content. Many of the rankest falsehoods were born this way - from absurd religious dogmatism, to psychoanalytic fairytales, to everyday delusions about one's <a href="{{mot}}">motives</a> and <a href="{{pos}}">qualities</a>. <a href="{{mindful}}">It has surged</a> in the last decade, under the modest and retroactively scientific branding "mindfulness". 

As usual I'm suspicious. Knowledge comes from perception (sometimes), reason (sometimes), memory (sometimes), testimony (sometimes) - the contribution of this other thing is unclear. 

An empirical argument against introspection is that we've been introspecting for like <a href="{{homo}}">200,000 years</a> (or, properly, for <a href="{{ax}}">3,000</a>) and yet we didn't know very much about our minds until about <a href="{{germans}}">150 years</a> ago, when we started to use other methods. (Against this, you could separate out two goals for psychological work - _personal instrumental_ ones and _general scientific_ ones - and then argue that without introspection we'd have been even worse at the first goal, over our species' history.) <br><br>


### Bad kinds of introspection


#### As backdoor to objective reality

* <span class="b">Revelation or kashf</span>.<br> <a href="{{mig}}">Mistaking a</a> <a href="{{entheo}}">hallucination</a> for contact with ultimate reality.<br><br>
* <span class="b">Self-evident inference</span> <br>e.g. Descartes has this regrettable habit of leaping from "clear and distinct" (inconceivably-false) ideas to big synthetic claims. He thought he could establish the existence of God by <a href="{{descart}}">just noticing</a> that he has an idea of god, a perfect thing.<br><br>
* <span class="b">Inference to one's past</span> <br>If you use your current feelings as evidence for surprising claims about your distant past. e.g. From introspective things that <a href="{{anna}}">a patient</a> told someone else, Freud inferred that her serious respiratory/neurological illness was _caused_ by her resenting her father for his terminal illness. The history of psychoanalysis (cold-reading) from this <a href="{{anna}}">Patient Zero</a> on is full of this kind of thing, but the worst single event in it is maybe the <a href="{{falsem}}">lingering</a> false memory craze of the 90s, which harmed thousands of people by leading them to make horrible mistakes about their early childhood, based on Freud's false ideas about repression. (To what extent is predatory/collaborative delusion even introspection? I don't know.)<br><br>
* <span class="b">Inference to deep time</span> <br>Jung's idea of the <a href="{{jung}}">collective unconscious</a> is a mashup of a scientific hypothesis ("humans all share the following specific ideas as a result of our common ancestry") and a completely mad telepathic <a href="{{mono}}">world-mind thing</a>. Something like this might be possible - just not with this little data, or this method, or this investigator, or this entire worldview.

<br>

#### As backdoor to subjective reality

* <span class="b">Inference to the unconscious mind</span> <br>e.g. People insist on trying to find deep truths about the unconscious mind via dream interpretation, expending lots of ingenuity on what might well be a semi-random <a href="{{dreemz}}">byproduct of long-term memory encoding</a>.  <br><br>
* <span class="b">Inference to latent identity</span> <br>It's now common to identify what you _feel like_ with what you are. This has <a href="{{gend}}">good</a> and <a href="{{other}}">bad</a> sides, but in general the idea of a personal essence (as opposed to a personal <a href="{{algo}}">family-resemblence</a> of contingent properties) is false, and might imply a bad epistemology. (False since you would be a different person if your circumstances changed, even as little as "who you are currently talking to".)<br><br>

#### As waste

* <span class="b">Sitting with your eyes closed telling yourself you're not thinking</span>.<br> Which is what many 'meditation' sessions probably are.

<br>

The common failure above is taking introspection too seriously. If you're doing it for fun or catharsis, and manage to prevent it leaking into your beliefs, then good for you. It's an art in fact - consider improv, freestyling, automatic writing, internal family systems. I'm only hostile to the epistemic side.<br><br>


### Phenomenology & mindfulness

Phenomenology is a sort of philosophy that focusses on introspecting 'structures', facts about consciousness. (I am frustrated that I can't find a list of facts they claim to have found, in their century of striving, but not surprised.) This is as opposed to <a href="{{psyphy}}">psychophysics</a>, the cool quantitative study of stimuli and their mental results. To me, philosophy is the impersonal attempt to be maximally pedantic, but who knows, maybe it pays to be pedantic about subjective experience.<br>

Mindfulness is sanitised religious contemplation. (Then there's 'Focussing'.) 

I don't know very much about either, but <a href="{{chap}}">some normally</a> <a href="{{kaj}}">critical people</a> I admire think they are _very_ good, so they might not be bad introspections.

<br>

### Is there good introspection? 

Of course; consider what happens when you rate a film you just saw out of 5, or in fact when you give any opinion. 

<!-- Dehaene. -->

The point is that what you get from introspection isn't truth, but raw data - data that may need tremendous processing (cross-referencing, explanation in evolutionary or personal-history terms, correction for known biases) to even on average increase your self-knowledge. Also that taking the measurement will alter the mental content, to a possibly useless degree.

Rules of thumb might be: Don't take it literally; don't imagine you're in contact with your unconscious or your essence; don't generalise, even to your past or future _self_; use it as at most weak Bayesian evidence about the idea.

Justified uses for introspection, for me:

* _Belief propagation_. It seems to help with aligning different parts of the mind, for instance getting my <a href="{{system}}">automatic and explicit</a> circuits to pass information. Often a premise will change ("System 2"), without the intuitive associations changing ("System 1"). (Though I endorse resisting the inverse changes, where your feelings determine a belief.)<br><br>
* _Hypothesis generation_. If you don't know what's wrong it is obviously helpful to get ideas from an entangled source.<br><br>
* _Aid to debiasing_. Noticing is moving things from the periphery of your attention into consciousness, where you can evaluate it. For instance, people often don't "notice" their own current emotional state in this sense, but that's vital information if you're trying to be rational - if you're feeling threatened by a person or a topic, you're primed to reject arguments around it. A cue to double-check your reasoning, or to revisit once you've calmed down.<br><br>
* _Emotional processing_. I don't know how or <a href="{{rumi}}">when</a> thinking about things makes you feel better. But it usually works for me.<br><br>
* _Pretext for deep conversations_. I've done a few of these kind of workshops, and every single time I meet really interesting people who are there to open up and talk about fun serious things.

	    I suspect that introspection-done-right is largely about breaking or counteracting negative patterns, not establishing positive ones. I recently saw a video that I'd uncharitably sum up as "I used to harass random strangers for liking Marvel movies, but then I realised every tree is actually the same tree, so I stopped doing that and started feeling better." I'm genuinely glad that person had that revelation.<br><br> Also, if we're defining introspection widely enough, I think it's as much about constructing as discovering. As someone perennially low on sense-of-identity, I can't really begrudge people for putting in the time to build that for themselves, even if they tend to look (and/or be) crazy while doing so.

	    Two prominent things many seem to find with mindfulness meditation are:<br>
    	a) your experience (the „inner world simulation“+mental workspace+emotions+...) is not centered in your head or experienced by a seperate „self“-construct that resides behind your eyes. Experience in some sense is simply there.<br>
    	b) thoughts can be observed. Somehow I mostly feel like my thoughts are being actively thought by some self that is phenominologically positioned behind my eyes. I can lose this sense during mindfulness meditation, where a thought becomes just another phenomenon in a space of experiences.<br>
    	c) you can gain significant control over you being sucked into streams of ruminating thoughts. First you notice it and take a step back and switch into „these are all phenomena in a space of experience“ mode. This usually takes away the mental energy that was invested into the thoughts and the thoughts stop feeding your emotional state, and the emotional state stops eliciting more ruminating.<br><br>
    	I recommend Sam Harris’ Waking Up meditation course if anybody is interested in exploring such things. Investment: 10 minutes for 50 days and you should get a solid impression of mindfulness meditation.“
