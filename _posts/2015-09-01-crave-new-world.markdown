<br>

What marvellous consensus! Taoists, Stoics, conservatives, radicals, Christians, Jews, Fascists, artists. A grand panoply, divided on many fundamentals, united in this!&nbsp;Call the doctrine they hold in common <em>contrast ideology</em><em>.</em> "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taijitu">Tajituism</a>" might seem a fairer name, after the famous yin-yang symbol - but the Asian doctrine is actually not the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taijitu#European_iconography">earliest</a> of the symbol's tendrils. (Not that identical symbols imply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika">identical ideas</a>.) Also, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrastivism">Contrastivism</a> took that word already.<br />
<br />

Contrast ideology is one of the most interesting ideas I know. It leads to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Soul-making_or_Irenaean_Theodicy">most fruitful</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Evil_is_complementary_to_good">theodicy</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism#Structuralism_in_linguistics">fascinating semantics</a>, and also to the most therapeutic secular philosophy of life. It is a deeply beautiful thought -&nbsp;and I will fight it until it dies. (Or until it allows <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/tabconhi.htm">alternatives</a> to live.) <br />
<br />
I'm here focussing on the most pressing subset of contrast ideologies:&nbsp;the philosophical justification of suffering, call it hormetism or <em>lacrimism</em>. It is relativism with regards to suffering; the pessimistic belief in the symmetry and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obligate_parasite">obligate</a> symbiosis of the polar values. I there associated it&nbsp;with structuralism - but rather than linguistic, literary or anthropological structuralism, lacrimism is <em>naive ethical</em> structuralism.
<br><br>
It needs attacking because&nbsp;it promotes conservatism and <em>indifference</em> to world problems -&nbsp;often on matters that <em>aren't</em> intractable. It also weights a portion of the world down with a piteous, gnarling masochism (which, I think, outweighs its&nbsp;therapeutic role). Less seriously, it underwrites a repugnant conception of art: as dark Romantic summum bonum.<br />
<br />
The world is rammed full of suffering. How can we cope with this?<br />

<ol>
	<li>Sado-masochism.</li>
	<li>Withdrawal (asceticism; indifference)</li>
	<li>Lacrimism </li>
	<li>e.g. Stoicism</li>
	<li>e.g.&nbsp;Theodicy</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_%28bioethics%29">Abolitionism</a>.</li>
</ol>
<br />


The rest of this essay is an attempt to show you that all religious and philosophical responses to endemic suffering follow one of the above patterns.

<br />

I have perhaps been muddling several claims together, one or two of which are true and&nbsp;good:<br><br>
<ul><li>"The world is essentially just." (Just-world. Karma)</li><br />
<li>"Suffering is profound and glorious"</li><br />
<li>"There are other worthy goals but happiness". (Yes!)</li><br />
<li>"Positive and negative things are not alien to each other, but related and continuous." (The rejection of antitheses; yes.) </li><br />
<li>Suffering and only suffering enables defiance.</li><br />
<li>Suffering and only suffering produces strength.</li><br />
<li>Conflict and only conflict produces progress (Mark and Hayek!)</li><br />
<li>A series of well-documented&nbsp;scientific&nbsp; (hormetism; value relativity; experience-stretching). I can't oppose.</li></ul>
<br><br>

Pains that lead to gain are comparatively rare. And that it is an inverse relationship:
<br />
<br />
("Its insistence on the evil in man's nature, and in particular on the root of that evil, suited the New England temperament well which had been shaped by a similar Puritan emphasis. In fact, to hear Anna Freud speak of the criminal tendencies of the one and two-year-old is to be reminded inevitably of Calvinistic sermons on infant damnation." - <a href="http://scdc.library.ptsem.edu/mets/mets.aspx?src=PSB1959523&div=5&img=7">David McClelland</a>.)<br />
<br />
<em>Biological </em>hormesis is&nbsp;relatively new but an extremely well-confirmed&nbsp;natural phenomenon. The hygiene hypothesis is the most famous instance, and mithridatism the most sensational. (Didn't <em>your</em> school friends speak of Rasputin with awe?)<br />
<br />


<strong>0. Stoicism.</strong><br><br>
<strong><br />a. Trivial Lacrimosa Principle: </strong>Good can come of suffering; it's not always in vain. (It can have extrinsic value.)<br />
<strong><br />b. Strong Lacrimosa Principle </strong>(descriptive)<strong>:</strong> Negative experience is essential to the existence of positive experience. Good would not be good without bad to identify it against.<br />

<br />
<strong>b*. SLP</strong> (prescriptive): Suffering promotes the existence of great things.<br />
<br />
<strong>c. Ultra Lacrimosa Principle</strong>: Suffering is intrinsically valuable. Suffering cannot be in vain.

<br />
<strong>d. Nihilist's Lacrimosa Principle:</strong> The positive and negative are so mingled that distinction between them is illusion. Happiness has no intrinsic
<br><br>

I am a fool if I deny the weak principle. But the lessons I derive from it are very different from lacrimism's; and our acceptance of stronger forms must be only as a philosophical last resort. We might yet change things enough.

As with so much else in existentialism, we owe the seed of lacrimism to theology. It come of the brilliant thousand-year intellectual project to let God off the hook of charges of criminal negligence.

		The great pre-industrial and pre-scientific civilisations, especially perhaps the Western ones, tend to see man as half-angel, half-beast ... This dualistic vision caused great torment to those condemned to live with it... It provided a validation for the rules and values towards which men were obliged to aspire. They contained an answer to the question – why must we strive and suffer so? These higher values were tied to the better parts of the total cosmic order, and to the better elements within man...

Most commonly a submerged religiousness. "We are fallen, so we deserve to suffer."<br />
<br />

Accusing anyone of rationalisation is always shaky. But isn't the strong lacrimosa principle <em>precisely </em>the story that an entity impotent in the face of lifelong angst and pain would tell itself, to get by?

Antithesis. Our prejudice for theoretical symmetry has caused a great deal of harm already. Unify.

<br><br>

So, what's the alternative? Don't I have to be radically manichaean? Am I not falling foul of what Nietzsche flagged up <em>ages</em> ago as the irrational love of antithetical values? Will I destroy lacrimism's placebo effect in the name of truth? Can one really reconcile this moral dualism with one's love of shiny pluralism?
