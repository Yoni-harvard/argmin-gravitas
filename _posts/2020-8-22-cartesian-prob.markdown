	An extremely important idea I haven't seen in my circles:
	"How can I know that things are as they seem?"
		"how to distinguish between dreaming that one is experiencing something and actually experiencing it.""
	Error avoidance as opposed to true belief maximisation
	How can these differ? When you have excess mass on "unknown", suspending judgment
	Means a few things
		First philosophy. Peirce: nope
			 beginning with methodological doubt 
		the subject-object relation
		"Actuality vs possibility"
