<br>

The 'epistemic barrier' is a thing between the mind and the external world: the thing that makes it possible to say that <a href="{{rs}}">we do not have any knowledge</a>.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a> It's not very popular: I count n arguments for why it isn't there. (You can tell they didn't work because there are n of them and not one.)
<br>

Still, I (and the whole field) learned a lot about epistemology arguing about this stuff, and the thought still tickles me.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a> So here's what I think Pearce was getting at:
<br><br>

<ol>
	<li>The brain is made of food, ingested matter.</li>
	<li>Knowledge inheres in the brain.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a></li>
	<li>So knowledge inheres in (metabolised) food.</li>
	<li>Food, like all matter, is of the external world.</li>
	<li>So the mind inheres in the external world.</li>
	<li>So there is no metaphysical barrier between mind and world.</li>
	<li>So there is no puzzle about the possibility of knowledge.</li>
</ol><br>


Clearly this does not defeat the radical sceptic in her original, Cartesian <a href="{{int}}">internalist</a> problematic ("<i>it's an epistemic barrier, not a metaphysical one - I don't grant (1) or (2) or (4)</i>"). But one good candidate for a philosophical fact is: nothing can. The only way to win is <a href="{{prag}}">not to play</a>.

	it is true that ‘I seem to see a table’ does not entail ‘I see a table’; but ‘I seem to feel a pain’ does entail ‘I feel a pain’. So scepticism loses its force — cannot open up its characteristic gap — with regard to that which ultimately most concerns us, pleasure and pain.
