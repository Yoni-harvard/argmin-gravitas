Just found out that the climactic line in "Boys of Summer" is not the sublime, tense

"I can't tell you my love will still be strong / after the boys of summer"

but the flat, deluded, standard

"I can tell you my love will still be strong / after the boys of summer"

The first: Temptation as foregone conclusion, doubt, the acceptance of transience

The second: unjustified assertion

"can't" makes us demand to know about the boys of summer. Who are they? Why are they taking your boy/girl, or anyway making them doubt?
Why is Don Henley's head getting turned by summer boys?
Of course it's not "after I meet the boys of summer", "after I fuck the boys of summer", "after the boys of summer tell me about you"

It's "post summer", post youth



> I see the boys of summer in their ruin
Lay the gold tithings barren,
Setting no store by harvest, freeze the soils;
There in their heat the winter floods
Of frozen loves they fetch their girls,
And drown the cargoed apples in their tides.

> These boys of light are curdlers in their folly,
Sour the boiling honey;
The jacks of frost they finger in the hives;
There in the sun the frigid threads
Of doubt and dark they feed their nerves;
The signal moon is zero in their voids.

> I see that from these boys shall men of nothing
Stature by seedy shifting,
Or lame the air with leaping from its heats;
There from their hearts the dogdayed pulse
Of love and light bursts in their throats.
O see the pulse of summer in the ice.

> I see you boys of summer in your ruin.
Man in his maggot's barren.
And boys are full and foreign to the pouch.
I am the man your father was.
We are the sons of flint and pitch.
O see the poles are kissing as they cross.
