> Everything is amazing right now, and nobody’s happy... I was on an airplane and there was internet, high speed internet on the airplane... I'm watching YouTube clips; it's amazing... then it breaks down and they apologize: 'the internet is not working'. And the guy next to me goes 'pah! this is bullshit!' ...<br><br>
Everybody on every plane should just constantly be going: “Oh my God, wow!” ... you’re sitting in a chair in the sky! ...People say 'there’s delays on flights' - delays? Really? New York to California in 5 hours! That used to take 30 years  and a bunch of you would die on the way there...

> we do not notice absolute changes in stimuli; we notice relative changes. Which leads to an answer to the question above:
the error that needs to be reduced in the brains of organisms such as ourselves is not absolute error, but relative error.

<center> – <a href="{{log}}">Varshney & Sun</a></center>
<br>

When deciding whether a situation is good or bad, you can compare up (to a superior reference class) or compare down. 

<a href="{{relat}}">A key finding</a> of the behavioural and psychological sciences is that humans don't take absolute measurements (naturally). Instead we find some similar object and judge things relative to it. This is why <a href="{{an}}">anchoring</a>, framing effects (etc) work on us, when they shouldn't. Most importantly: we seem to judge value this way too. The tantalising possibility is that we can _create_ value for free, by merely changing our framing.<br><br>

<h3>Examples:</h3>

* To have <a href="{{grat}}">gratitude</a> for ❌ is to compare down to a world where you don't have it.<br><br>

* Clinical trials with placebo controls are comparing down, to (roughly) nothing; clinical trials with reference treatment controls are comparing up. <br><br>

* One of the strongest ways to make me realise my good fortune is checking my 'temporal privilege'. <a href="{{tabb}}">In many ways</a> it is better to be a minimum-wage worker now than to be Julius Caesar, or King Croesus in their time. There is no amount of money you could give me to live in the year 1700 even. (It's far larger than the other privileges.)<br><br> When people (or <a href="{{g}}">I myself</a>) complain about the tedium or inauthenticity of white-collar jobs, I retort, “But think of how painful and miserable and cold and hungry and scared and ignorant our ancestors were! Your problems are small on the long view, and in such a rich society <a href="{{gwern}}">there is an alternative</a>". (Gwern's calculation is not prudential: it is a tool to force you to realise your freedom and your luck.) <br><br>


* When rating my own posts' <a href="{{imp}}">importance</a>, I compare up to the most important possible work: the one that discusses how to preserve value until the far reaches of the future, over trillions of years. If I compared down, to an average social media status update, then my scores would be much higher.<br><br>

* When I play saxophone I often feel frustration at not sounding like Coltrane or Parker (up); but when I sing I feel joy at just being able to make noise (down). I'm not sure which mindset has led to better improvement. <br><br>

* Picking a too-extreme reference class leads to absurd decisions. When my food is starting to go bad, I opt not to eat it – when I might instead compare down to having no food at all and a skeletal death. <br><br>

* <a href="{{singer}}">Strong</a> consequentialism (the view that it is mandatory to improve the world as much as you can) compares up, and only up, to a perfect altruist with my skills and resources. It doesn't matter that most people do relatively little for others; it doesn't matter if I do a lot already.
<br><br>


* I think some part of politics reduces to this. When questions of UK social justice come up, my first thoughts are things like, “Yeah, but the British minimum wage is in <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i">the top 15% of global incomes</a>”. I compare down to the global working class.<br><br> This is true and important, but for some purposes <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a> it is also stupid, since on the sad margin of nationalist politics, giant transfers like GiveDirectly are not on the table. Unless giant public transfers to <a href="{{give}}">GiveDirectly</a> are in fact a politically viable option, it does not help to paint the locally poor as globally rich. Maybe some people are <a href="{{ineff}}">inefficiently rich</a> on <i>any</i> reading.<br><br> However, we have to remember that the converse – comparing up, to a better arrangement – often means making a comparison with something that doesn’t exist, never has, and may not be able to. <br><br>


When it's important to improve, you want to compare up. When it's more important to feel good, or to just _get on with it_, you want to compare down. I try to do plenty of both. e.g. "Relative to the human average I've done a lot and know a lot." Comparing up is more natural to me, so I make an effort to recall my achievements and the base rates.

Saying “what I have is good” might reduce your drive to improve the situation. Are the two package deals 1) gratitude &amp; de facto conservatism, or 2) aggro, envy, &amp; progress? Yes, maybe, but we can always try to alternate. really fast.

	<h3>Actual science</h3>
	<div>
		I found exactly <a href="{{ideal}}">one paper</a> vaguely testing the comparing-up intervention. But the similarities between physical perception and value perception (both involve relative top-down processing) make me wonder if predictive processing is involved. The connoisseur's hammer for every psychological nail.
		<br><br>
		The idea is in the same space as <a href="{{mind}}">growth mindset</a>, or grit, or any number of overhyped academic rehashes of <a href="{{gump}}">gumption</a>. Then there's mindfulness, which is another claim about one's stance having strong effects on value of experience.

	<h3>Better to be a subaltern in New York than the emperor of old Rome</h3>
	<div>
		<a href="{{milan}}">Branko Milanovic</a>, setting up a strawman to dismiss:<br><br>
		<blockquote>
			For Julius Caesar to read a book overnight, easily move at night around his palace, or listen to the songs he liked would have required perhaps hundreds of workers (slaves) to hold the torches or sing his favorite arias all night. Even Caesar, if he were to do that night after night, might, after some time, have run out of resources (or might have provoked a rebellion among the singers).<br><br> But for us the expense for a similar pleasure is very small, even trivial, say $2 per night. Consequently, some people come to the conclusion that Caesar must have had tiny wealth measured in today’s bundle of goods since a repeated small nightly expense of $2 (in today’s prices) would have eventually ruined him. Other people at Caesar’s time had obviously much less: ergo, the world today is incomparably richer than before.
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		The exception is of course the dubious goods of position and domination. But I don't want these, and don't want to want them.
