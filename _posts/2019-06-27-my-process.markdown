> How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives... A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time. A schedule is a mock-up of reason and order — willed, faked, and so brought into being; it is a peace and a haven set into the wreck of time; it is a lifeboat on which you find yourself, decades later, still living.

Life is long but finite. Most of our actions are automatic/intuitive - not really consciously pursuing particular goals. (We don't pay attention to how we allocate our attention.) Most default actions end up not helping us with our goals. So we suffer unnecessarily, or make others suffer. 

You have value; you could have more. Few people are the perfect lived expression of their highest values - I think they'd probably be insufferable. (Ayn Rand comes to mind.)

For about a year I've been collecting practical tricks that are supposed to improve you in some way. The problem is that self-help, and its internet successor "lifehacking", are full of nonsense.

These can be as humble and uncontroversial as "always put your keys in the same place when you come home" or as weird as "<a href="{{gwern}}">try out 100 different biochemicals</a> and quantify the results", or as abstract as .

Until recently I didn't really reflect on myself, preferring to charge ahead and just try stuff.

These mostly take the form of overriding habits or instincts with external help. There's something to be said for not ordering yourself around. There's something to be said for using intuition as an information source (about yourself). There's a _lot_ to be said for sometimes doing nothing in particular (including meditating, you sneak!). If you want to be an idler, be <a href="{{idler}}">an idler</a>: it's fun and surprisingly dignified. But if you want to do something big, you could probably do with more structure.


Despite appearances this isn't inimical to creativity or freedom: professional artists are most vocal about their intentional 'process'.
    https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Art/What_is_the_Creative_Process%3F

I've bolded the top 10, the ones that help most.




## Meta
1. <a href="{{bugs}}">Bug list</a>. Can't improve things if you don't know what's wrong.
	routine; work; hobbies, habits, skills; environment; wastes of time; blind spots; fears and aversions

2. Good sleep. Enables everything else.
		i.e. No screens after 10pm, no caffeine, eye mask, foam pillow.
		Matthew Walker's book is scary enough to have actually changed my behaviour despite not telling me huge amounts of new info.
		It puts the opportunity cost ("but I could read another chapter if I stayed up") on the right scale.

3. Learning.

4. Quantified self.
	Local validity.     Humans are too causally dense to do much more than local inference.    This is inefficient but what you gonna do.

                        Measurable: Know what it will look like and feel like when you've succeeded.
                        Attainable: Keep your goals in-line with what you believe you can really achieve.
                        Resonant: Look inside to make sure the goals are truly meaningful to you. If it's a goal you "should" do, beware!
                        Time-bound: Have deadlines for each of your goals and stick to them.

        Models
            Bayesian reasoning	
                assign a probability before an event, receive evidence, update the probability. 	
                Your intuition is not worthless; 	
                forces us to think probabilistically; 	
                allows us to count competing evidence;
                promotes a nuanced view.
            Inside view / outside view	
                Reference class forecasting	
                To not suffer the planning bias, ignore your particularities and look to similar project performance
            Signalling	
                actions convey information about the actor. Buying an expensive wedding ring conveys that you (think you) won't run off after the wedding. 
                Countersignalling: intentionally doing something low status to show that you are so high status that you can afford such a hit
                    Anti-signalling: intentionally not signalling, to show that you (think you're) above it. 
            Nudge: choice architecture	
                the presentation of choices can have dramatic effects on decisions. 	
                Trivial Inconveniences Mean We Give Up
            Marginal thinking	what are extra resources worth? Less and less.
            System 1 (Automatic) vs System 2 (Deliberate)	
                decisions use two different systems. System 1 is fast and subconscious: ‘gut’. Wins socially or danger. System 2 is slower and methodical, better with numbers.
            Aliefs / Beliefs
                automatic tendency / endorsed rational claims
            Comparative vs. absolute advantage 	
                positive-sum trade is always possible; people should do the action that they’re the least bad at	rather than their absolute best
            Illusion of transparency	
                we tend to overestimate how much our mental state is known by others. e.g. rhythmic tapping terrible for communicating melody.
            Opportunity cost	
                payoff minus next best payoff. if you don’t spend your time in the best way possible, that costs.
            Cognitive biases	
                systematic flaws in how we think. 	
                We don’t look for information that proves us wrong. 	
                We estimate easily recalled events as more likely than they are. 	
                We’re overconfident. Particularly relative to our level of expertise. 	
                "Only our enemies are biased."	
                "only our friends and colleagues who are biased."
            Heuristics 	
                we use rules of thumb to make decisions quickly. notice that we are using them because they can be wrong.
            Counterfactual reasoning 	
                what else would have happened in the absence of x? 		
                    e.g. pushing the paramedic out of the way and do the CPR yourself, but you’ll likely do a worse job. 		
                        even if you stop the patient from dying, your (counterfactual) impact is small, if not negative. 		
                        Doctors wanting to make a big difference will do more good if they travel to a developing country where their patients might not have received quality healthcare if not for them. 
            Expected value	
                the probability of each outcome multiplied by the value of each outcome. 	
                50% chance of $100 is worth $50, so be willing to invest up to $50 for a chance to win. 
            Time value of money
                we’d prefer to have $100 today than tomorrow, or in a year. Thus money today is worth more than money in the future. discount rate: How much less you’d be willing to receive now than in a year. Shouldn't be more than interest rate.	because more opportunities (to invest)	because less uncertainty in whether there'll be a payoff
            Money value of time: 	
                time is a scarce resource, can be used to earn money or do something else of value. So assign it monetary value, or money time value. 		
                    Even if driving to the other side of town saves you $10 on groceries, if it takes you an extra hour, you’re implicitly valuing your free time at $10 per hour. The goodness of a deal depends on your market position.
            Prisoner’s dilemma 	
                players choosing between cooperating and defecting. 
                Co/co = +/+. 
                Co/def = ++/--, 
                def/def = -/-. 	
                equivalent to Tragedy of the commons	
                e.g. country not limiting carbon emissions; 	e.g. athletes doping; 	e.g. dodging road tax 
            Moloch
            Revealed preferences 	
                talk is cheap, our actions reveal more about us than we’d like to believe. 
                Polls vs ballots
                Tool for controlling for bs and hypocrisy
            Typical mind fallacy	
                forgetting Neurodiversity	mistaken belief that others have the same mental experiences.	
                    ‘see’ a zebra in their mind’s eye, some recall the vague idea of a zebra, others can count stripes!
            Fundamental attribution error 	
                attributing others’ actions to their personality, but your actions to your situation. 	They kick the vending machine - must be because they're an angry person. 	You kick the vending machine because you were hot and thirsty and the vending machine stole your last dollar.
            Aumann’s agreement theorem	
                if two rational agents disagree when they have exactly the same information, one of them must be wrong. 	very often disagreement is due to differences in information, not failure of rationality. 	take disagreement seriously if the other person probably has significant information you don’t.
            Bikeshedding	
                substituting a hard and important problem for an easy and inconsequential one. 	questions everyone is clever enough to contribute to, everyone wants to have their opinions heard. 	discussed at the cost of a crucial detail, like how to prevent the power plant from killing everyone.
            Meme	
                a social gene, unit of selection for rituals, behaviours, and ideas. 	
                Contagion, mutation, selection gradient	
                the most useful memes don’t necessarily get reproduced. 	
                there should be few major social movements that don’t have “make more like-minded people join the movement”.
            Algernon’s Law
                Intelligence is adaptive
                So we shouldn't expect too many easy nootropics
            Social intuitionism
                moral judgements are made predominantly on the basis of intuition followed by rationalisation. 	
                slavery was previously the norm, thought to be acceptable. 	
                blind faith in intuitions can be harmful and counterproductive, because they can be easily corrupted by immoral social norms. 
                It wasn’t just that proponents of slavery got the wrong answer: they had — and we still have —  the wrong process.
            Apophenia 	
                tendency of humans to see patterns in random noise. 	e.g. hearing satanic messages when playing songs in reverse.
            Goodhart’s law 
                Campbell’s law	
                what gets measured, gets managed (and then fails to be a good measure). 	
                If we use GDP as a measure of prosperity of a nation, and there are incentives to show that prosperity is increasing, then nations could ‘hack’ this metric. In turn, this may raise GDP while failing to improve the living conditions in the country.
            Moral licensing	
                doing less good after you feel like you’ve already done some good. 	After donating to charity in the morning, we’re less likely to hold the door open for someone in the afternoon. 	The other reason ineffective charities are harmful.
            Chesterton’s fence	if you don’t see a purpose for a fence, don’t pull it down	
                If you can’t see the purpose of a social norm, like whether there is any value to having family unit, you shouldn’t ignore it without having thought hard about why it is there. Asking people who endorse the family unit why it’s important and noticing their reasoning is flawed often isn’t good enough either. 
            Peltzman effect	
                moral hazard of safety
                taking more risks when you feel more safe.	
                When seatbelts were first introduced, motorists actually drove faster and closer to the car in front of them.
            Semmelweis reflex	
                not evaluating evidence on the basis of its merits and instead rejecting it because it contradicts existing norms, beliefs and paradigms. 	Similar to the status quo bias (which one might choose to combat with the reversal test).
            Bateman’s principle	
                the most sexually selective sex will be that which has the most costs from rearing the offspring. In humans, women have more costs associated with raising offspring (maternal mortality, breastfeeding, rearing) and are the more selective sex. In seahorses, the opposite is true: male seahorses carry the offspring in their pouch, and are more selective with those they choose to mate with.
            Hawthorne effect	
                observer effect; people react differently when they know they are being observed; inherent experimental bias
            Bulverism	
                attacking the context of discovery rather than the context of justification	
                dismissing a claim on the basis of how the opponent got there, rather than a reasoned rebuttal. 
                “but you’re just biased!” or “of course you’d believe that, you’re scared of the alternative.”
            Schelling point	
                a natural point people converge upon independently.	participants may not even realise it’s happening.	
                e.g. "no genetic editing of humans, because we don't want inequality"
            Local vs global optima	
                you might need to make things worse to get to the best possible place. 	to earn more, you might have to sacrifice the short-term hours to take a course	often get stuck in a local optimum – it’s a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.
            Anthropic principle	
                you are given a sleeping pill which will wake you up twice if heads, and once if tails. You wake up. What is the chance that today is the day you wake up twice? 
                Similarly, what is the chance that we’re in one of the only universes that is capable of supporting life?
            Arbitrage	
                taking advantage of different prices between markets for the same products.	Money pumping
            Chaos theory
                the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.	aperiodic order
            Ingroup and outgroup psychology	
                xenophobia, the left-right political divide. 	Our circle of concern is probably expanding over time.
            Red Queen hypothesis	
                organisms need to constantly evolve to keep up with the offense or defense of their predators and prey. 	This is why sex exists.
            Schelling segregation	
                even when groups only have a mild preference to be around others with a similar characteristic – say, a preference for playing baseball – neighbourhoods will segregate on this basis.
            Pareto improvement	
                a change that makes at least one person better off, without making anyone worse off.  
            Occam’s razor
                among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
            Regression toward the mean	
                if you get an extreme result (in a normal distribution) once, additional results are likely to be closer to the average. 	If one trial suggests that a supplement is better than do other trials, don't put too much stock in that.
            Cognitive dissonance	
                holding two conflicting beliefs causes us to feel uncomfortable, to reject (at least) one of them. For instance, holding the belief that science is a useful way to discover the truth would conflict with another belief that vaccines cause autism. In you held both of these beliefs, one would have to be discarded.
            Coefficient of determination (R^2)	how well a model fits or explains data (i.e. how much of the variance it explains).
            Affective forecasting	
                predicting how happy you will be in the future contingent upon some event or change is hard. We normally guess that the magnitude of the effect will be larger than it actually is, because 1) we’ve just been asked to think about that event, which makes it seem more important than it actually is in our everyday happiness, and 2) we underestimate our ability to adapt.
            Fermi calculation 	
                sequence of guesses and simple arithmetic to estimate. 
            Elephant in the brain	
                adaptive self-deception
            Value of Information competing access needs
            Extra
                
            Efficient market hypothesis	
                a lot of clever people value approximately the same things as you. Everything is a market. Thus, when taking EMH into account, 1) look for the things you value in places other people have systematically failed to look, and 2) think that if something looks too good to be true, it probably is.

                        How much time would I be actively devoting to learning? (eg via experiments, classes or training vs just learning on the job)
                    Autonomy
                        How much choice would I have in what to work on? (eg do I need permission to switch projects, or to start a new project?)

        Honesty
        Prioritise
        Decouple
            Decoupling vs Contextualising
                Decoupling: looking at a single issue/question/idea/fact at a time. 
                    Related ideas, implications and associations only brought in explicitly and with the consent of all parties. 
                Contextualizing, on the other hand, means that all associative connections between ideas are valid and count as relevant if any party thinks they are.
        Be intentional
        Maintain an exciting and compelling vision of the future to fight apathy. 
            Make sure it’s slightly out of reach to keep pushing you. Never give up.
        learn tools for a job, not for the tools

            Write it down in great clarity and detail, then forget it. And let the 
            part of your subconscious mind that still remembers lead you to becoming
             the things you want, and maybe, years later, check if it did.
