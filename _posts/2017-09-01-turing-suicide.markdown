<center>~ Alan Turing</center>


The inquest into the death of Alan Turing was hasty and incompetent. For instance, the supposed suicide weapon, a poisoned apple, was never tested for poison. Turing's family ^

One great biographer, Andrew Hodges, considers it "obvious" that it was suicide.* Another, Jack Copeland, argues that the evidence is more consistent with accidental poisoning.

Hodges is thorough: I got most of the counterevidence below from his book. But, among its other offences** the <i>film</i> of his book invents wholesale a mental breakdown and teary confession of despair:

* "By the side of his bed was half an apple, out of which several bites had been taken. They did not analyse the apple, and so it was never properly established that, as seemed perfectly obvious, the apple had been dipped in the cyanide."

**  It invents a story about the police suspecting him of being a Soviet spy. It shows him covering up for a Soviet spy, John Cairncross; i.e. being a coward and traitor. It shows him building a computer with the same name as his first love, in an idiotic Frankenstein sense. It shows him having a breakdown after the hormone punishment. It hypes the relationship with Joan Clarke. It shows him being interrogated about his homosexuality, when actually he wrote a five-page confession outright, which is his largest contribution to gay rights: self-sacrifice as protest.

^ "John had already decided that it would be a mistake to contest a verdict of suicide, a policy from which the presence of a row of newspaper reporters did nothing to dissuade him."


This doesn't fit at all.

In the early 1950s, the suicide rate among British men in their early forties was

To my knowledge, there are no studies of suicide among gay men in the 50s, but in the 90s gay men in the US were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447240/ ">roughly three times</a> as likely to attempt suicide as straight men; this increase is a lower bound for the 1950s UK increase. The most relevant subpopulation, gay men convicted for having consensual sex and put on diethylstilbestrol, is a blank page.

The rate of death by accidental poisoning in this period is about <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hsq/health-statistics-quarterly/no--18--summer-2003/twentieth-century-mortality-trends-in-england-and-wales.pdf">90 per 100,000</a>.
Having been found dead, the probability of the cause being suicide was about 1% for a man like Turing (41 in 1954). 

The suicide rate would be higher for convicted people who have been castrated. But so would it be for "slovenly people who have cyanide experiments evaporating in the next room". This might even out, I don't know.

    The way to get a probability for an event which only happens once is to use Bayesian updating.










<h3>Evidence for suicide</h3>

<ul>
	<li>2 years earlier, unjust conviction and medical torture.</li>
	<li>20 years earlier, he mentioned a design for a suicide to a friend, involving an apple and electrified wire.^^^</li>

	<li>3 months earlier, made a new will. ("There was one piece of evidence that he had prepared for death: he had made a new will on 11 February 1954. This in itself was a kind of statement as to where he stood.")</li>

	<li>Testimony of Allan Pacey, an expert in male fertility that the effects of stilb are permanent.</li>

	<li>letters to Robin Gandy talks about his “shocking tendency at present to fritter my time away in anything but what I ought to be doing.”</li>

	<li>Fond of Snow White</li>

	+ in mid-May 1954, when Alan went with the Greenbaum family for a Sunday visit to Blackpool. It was a very fine day, and they walked cheerfully along the Golden Mile of seaside amusements, until they came across the Gypsy Queen, the fortune-teller. Alan went in, to consult her. Had not a gypsy foretold his genius, in 1922? The Greenbaums waited outside, and found themselves waiting for half an hour. When he came out, he was as white as a sheet, and would not speak another word as they went back to Manchester on the bus. They did not hear from him again, until he called on the Saturday two days before his death when, as it happened, they were out. They heard of his death before returning the call.

^^^ "James [Atkins] also had a letter from Alan which described, in a rather detached way, that he had been feeling depressed and mentioned that he had even thought of a scheme for ending his life. It involved an apple and electrical wiring."

^^ Typical error:
'However the coroner's report, also on display, is unequivocal: Turing had consumed the equivalent of a wine glass of poison.' It actually says that his stomach contained four ounces of bitter-smelling fluid, which inhalation could also easily cause.

<h3>Evidence against suicide</h3>

- Throughout his life, he was sloppy with hygiene and tidiness. ("The electrolysis experiment was wired into the ceiling light socket. On another occasion, an experiment had resulted in severe electric shocks. And he was known for tasting chemicals to identify them.")

- Autopsy shows slow. No contortion. Ingestion is rapidly and violently lethal, seconds.

- No mention to psychiatrist or closest confidants, both of whom he told the deepest personal problems to.

- "The day of the trial was by no means disagreeable. Whilst in custody with the other criminals, I had a very agreeable sense of irresponsibility, rather like being back at school." 
- Turing had cyanide in his house for chemical experiments he conducted in his tiny spare room - "the nightmare room".

- No evidence of pre-meditation.
This leaves 1) intentional hiding or 2) impulsivity. What % of suicides are apparently impulsive?

Or perhaps, more likely, he had accidentally inhaled cyanide vapours from the bubbling liquid. The nightmare room had a "strong smell" of cyanide after Turing's death. (cyanide inhalation leads to a slower death than ingestion and wouldn't necessarily induce contorted death throes)

- there was no clear pattern of decline or failure in his intellectual life that might in itself explain its abrupt end. It was rather a fluid, transitional period such as had occurred before in his development, and this time accompanied by a wider range of interests, and a more open attitude to intellectual and emotional life.

- It fell into no clear sequence of events. Nothing was explicit – there was no warning, no note of explanation. It seemed an isolated act of self-annihilation.

- while Alan lay in his small front bedroom, an electrolytic experiment was bubbling away at the back... He did sometimes use [potassium] cyanide for electrolysis, it being necessary for gold-plating... She argued that he had got cyanide on to his hands by accident, and thence into his mouth. This was, of course, what she had always said might happen. At Christmas 1953, when he made his last Guildford visit, she had repeated her warning (‘Wash your hands, Alan, and get your nails clean. And don’t put your fingers in your mouth!’).

- His working papers were left in an untidy mess in his room at the university... there was no wholesale clearing up, neither of personal papers nor of his research. It was as though he had planned for the possibility, but in the event acted impulsively.

- He had also booked as usual to use the computer on the Tuesday evening, and the engineers waited up for him, only hearing next day that he was dead. 

- His friendly next door neighbours, the Webbs, had moved to Styal on the Thursday, and he had had them to dinner on the previous Tuesday, merry and chatty. He had been much regretting their move, spoke of visiting them, and said he was glad that the new occupants would be young and with young children. 

- There were purchases, including theatre tickets, in his house when he died; he had written, though not posted, an acceptance of an invitation to a Royal Society function on 24 June. 

- "Neither, indeed, did his Guildford visit [to his mother] take on a leavetaking character"

-  Robin Gandy: Turing "seemed, if anything, happier than usual".



<h3>Evidence neither way</h3>

o  There was a half-eaten apple beside his bed. However, he usually ate an apple before bed. (At wartime Hanslope Park, "Alan was also able to have the apple that as a rule he would always eat before going to bed.")


Given the weakness of the evidence, why is the suicide hypothesis the received wisdom? Well, without over-egging it: it makes a better story. And it gives the event meaning - terrible, but morally straightforward meaning. It makes Turing's death about homophobia, rather than an absurd empty accident.
