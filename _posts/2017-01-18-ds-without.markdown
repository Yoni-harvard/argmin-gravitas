Inspired by [this][Snot] detailed list of concepts and skills that separate a freshman programmer from a lead engineer. (It is aggressively written, but when I was a clueless beginner, I found the detail and disdain invigorating.)

| Skill			|	As question									|	Typical of
| 
| Domain analysis	|	What does this vague request really mean?	|	Statistician, software dev	
| Data collection	|	What evidence exists? What can I use?		|
| Exploratory analysis |	What is the data like? What jumps out?	|
| Tool choice		|	What software suits this task best?			|
| Metric choice	|	How will we judge success?					|
| Feature selection |	Which parts are useful?						|
| Data cleaning	|	How to remove flawed data?					|
| Data wrangling	|	How to transform data?						|
| Modelling		|	What structure will answer the question?	|
| Evaluation		|	How good is this model? Under conditions?	|
| Deployment		|	How will this be used? Who will use it?		|
| Communication	|	What result?								|
