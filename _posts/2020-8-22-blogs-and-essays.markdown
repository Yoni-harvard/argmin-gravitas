Blogging peaked in 2009; I was there, just. Dozens of people used to comment on everything. Famous economics professors followed my obscure fumbling posts, inexplicably. I probably learned about as much from all these <a href="{{roll}}">personal sites</a> as I have from three stints at university. <br><br>

Blogging was mostly social: like a public diary; as if everyone was a newspaper columnist. "Here's what I'm thinking" or "here's my reaction to what Dubya just said". There were various <a href="{{sphere}}">Spheres</a>, where amateurs and <a href="{{ec}}">professionals</a> of various sorts thought out loud and gossiped and <a href="{{leiter}}">bitched</a>. 

It had an economy, <a href="{{eg}}">thousands</a> of people making a living off it (or anyway <a href="{{five}}">someone</a> making money off it). That racket is still there, but the clever people long ago moved to Youtube and Insta and podcasts and newsletters.

Blogs were supplanted by centralised social media, maybe because they're more effective for broadcasting and harvesting status, and because no-one is aiming for more than ephemerality. (When was the last time you looked at what anyone said on Facebook last year?)

In the transition period, your Twitter or Tumblr page got called a <a href="{{mic}}">microblog</a>. (That makes Insta and Tiktok 'picoblogs'.) But people moved on, making the original unit superfluous.

Overlooked fact: the internet <a href="{{rot}}">dies off</a> at an astounding rate. The average link stops working after about two and a half years. Not only was blogging reactive and parochial; it was also mortal.<br><br>


## Essays vs blogposts

> blogging is not a form of writing... Blogging is an activity that is so distinct from the experience of writing that it should be called something else altogether. One does not write a blog post except in the sense that one "writes" a shopping list or a business plan...

> Blogging, in my experience, reduces writing to the short-term effects you have on your readers and they have on you. You try to have an immediate, essentially real-time impact on the discourse, which makes it much more like speech than writing. . . .

As a result, when I'm in a poncey mood I say I don't write blogposts - they're essays. This ain't no blog, it's a 'site'!
Basbøll uses "Writing" for the real deal, to be backwards compatible with the likes of Roland Barthes. But this is the most confusing possible name for it!

In a way it's funny to set up essays as a superior substitute for blogging / social media musing, since "essay" (_<a href="{{ess}}">attempt</a>_) was itself  self-consciously inferior to big tedious monographs from the start. ("The essay - or microtreatise.")

But never mind terminology. The inimitable Gwern aims for "'<a href="{{long}}">long content</a>", posts which are updated continuously for decades, living, growing piece by piece into magnificence:

> how do you write a personal site with the long-term in mind? We live most of our lives in the future, and the actuarial tables give me until the 2070–2080s... What sort of writing could you create if you worked on it (be it ever so rarely) for the next 60 years? What could you do if you started now?... 

> what would constitute Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content?...

>  the pages will persist through time, and they will gradually improve over time. But a truly Long Now approach would be to make them be improved by time—make them more valuable the more time passes. 




It's not about being pompous or pretending to have timeless wisdom; it's the attempt to do things that become more and more amazing, which are worth keeping updated, worth living up to.

Depending on the field, a PhD might involve reading <a href="{{matt}}">100</a> - <a href="{{qu}}">400</a> papers, doing a thousand hours of asynchronous, unpredictable Innovative Work, then writing about <a href="{{hum}}">5 papers</a>. Call it 6000 hours. If you did this for 5 hours a week, say on a Sunday afternoon after waking late and having brunch and ambling about, you could do something of comparable scale over about 20 years: with no financial implications, no sweat, <a href="{{ben}}">no mental breakdown</a>. _While working full-time on other things_, and with my life 30% gone already, I could do ten things this hard, just with suitable long-sighted use of weekends. 

(As it happens I think most PhDs don't have much impact on the world: they are read by say 4 other people, and maybe _should_ not be read by many more than that. But that's good: instead I can do a thousand small things, each with their own contribution to the future of all things.)<br><br>

This allows him to uncouple from the reactive journalistic stuff, and lets us see if his take holds up. I have learned so much from it, and indeed it is an accumulating, long-term project: it documents his shift towards understanding the deep problems in large parts of academic science.
