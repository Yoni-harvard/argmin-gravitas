### 1 million x. Ceiling


### 260,000x. Ground-floor Bitcoin mining

2009 address
[40 BTC ($391,055)](https://whale-alert.io/transaction/bitcoin/cb1440c787d8a46977886405a34da89939e1b04907f567bf182ef27ce53a8d71)

Mining this would have cost about [$1.20](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.565497/full#h4) in energy in 2010. Add in $0.30 for the amortized PC. (This might not be realised, just shuffling around, but good enough.)


### ??,000x. Dutch East India Company
1602. Dutch govt. 
    $7.8T at peak
    realised 1799
    Mixture of trade and plunder
    monopoly over the Asian trade. For a time in the seventeenth century, it was able to monopolise the trade in nutmeg, mace, and cloves

### 25,000x. Wardian cases
UK Government (Kew Gardens): Wardian cases for tea and quinine and rubber
    20,000 tea plants smuggled out of Shanghai to begin the tea plantations of Assam in 1849.
        world's largest tea-growing region
        £10bn a year * 65 years = 150bn
    1860, quinine from Brazil
        basis for empire
        £6.4m a year * 100 years = £1bn
    1870, rubber from Brazil
        Ceylon and Malaya
        later the main source for British WW2 military
        £100bn
    Retired in 1962.

### 21,000x. Bletchley.
1938. 
    UK Government: £3000 (£137,962) for five years of Alan Turing's best work
    Total military budget was £3bn a year. Call it 0.5% = £15m 
        £6,000 (£392,000) for the grounds
    Returns
        War shortened by 2 years
            £2.6 trillion = 14 million lives at SVOL £1.83m / 10
        About 2000 ships saved, 10 million tons 
            About a third of all ships
            $1 trillion
        April 1945 July 1941 = 3.7 years of cracks

### 5000x. Apple.
1977. Mike Markkula: $80,000 ($368,055) for one-third of Apple. Now worth $1.5bn
But had he held all the way and sold now, 7.8 million x

### 1000x floor: stock average

    May 26, 1896 = **40.94**
    36,000

I received little help from historians. Almost none of them think in these terms; few pay much heed to two orders of magnitude, or any.
