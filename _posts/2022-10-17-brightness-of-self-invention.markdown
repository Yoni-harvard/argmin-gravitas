In order, I realised:

<!-- - that parents are people -->
- that books are large
- that large parts of society are arbitrary
- that language is arbitrary
- that confidence is either thoughtless or a trick
- that nihilism is arbitrary

- that left and right is a small part of political space 
- that radicalism does very little
- PCA. Realise that not everything reflects ideology
- that bureaucracy does nothing and that government is bureaucracy
- that large parts of society are not arbitrary
- that careers [can be good](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jcc-2012-1870/html), capital-g Greek Good.
- that economic science is not objective
- that economic science is not completely subjective

- Regression. Realise that machines can spot patterns, socially critical and philosophically rich patterns
- ITN. 

- that art is tiny by comparison with the world
- that philosophy is a cage
- that I need to become technical to do great things
- that I need to become technical to do real philosophy
- that corporations are not efficient either
- that most science is not real science
<!-- - that I have arrived (thanks Tyler) -->
- that running your own business is freedom
- IRL. Realise that tasks are not a metaphysical thing, can be inferred quant
