In order, I realised:

- that books are large
- that large parts of society are arbitrary
- that language is arbitrary
- that confidence is either thoughtless or a trick
- that nihilism is arbitrary

- that left and right is a small part of political space 
- that radicalism does very little
- that economic science is not objective
- that bureaucracy does nothing
- that government is bureaucracy
- that large parts of society are not arbitrary
- that economic science is not completely subjective

- that art is tiny by comparison with the world
- that philosophy is a cage
- that I need to become technical to do great things
- that I need to become technical to do real philosophy
- that most science is not real science
- that running your own business is freedom
