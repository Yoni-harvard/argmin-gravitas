Since I was a teen, I realised:

<!-- - that parents are people -->
- that books are large
- that large parts of society are arbitrary
- that language is arbitrary
- that confidence in the young is either unthinking or a trick
- that nihilism is arbitrary
- that pure logic cannot tell us how the world is (but can say what it cannot be)
- that bad is worse than good is good
- that left and right is a small part of political space 
- that radicalism does very little
- that conflict theory is self-fulfilling
- that there is more to life than avoiding error 
- that much of what we call intelligence is mere legal intelligence, winning arguments
- that art is tiny by comparison with the world
- that most creativity is found outside art
- that most acclaimed books are not very good
- that principal components analysis works and is holy. that not _everything_ reflects the subject's ideology
- that machines can spot patterns, socially critical and philosophically rich patterns
- that bureaucracy serves itself first, wastes 90% of what it is given, and that government is bureaucracy
- that you cannot be happy or productive unless you accept that you are not The Protagonist, above discomfort and boredom, more important than others 
- that corporations are not efficient at their own goal
- that large parts of society are not arbitrary
- that careers [can be good](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jcc-2012-1870/html), capital-g Good.
- that work can be amazing, that work is the basis of most other goods
- that efficiency is constructive laziness
- that good on one axis is very often worth bad on another
- that economic science is not objective
- that economic science is not completely subjective
- that most people's goals lack one or more of importance, neglectedness, or tractability
- that philosophy is a cage
- that I need to become technical to do great things
- that I need to become technical to do real philosophy
- that most fields are quite methodologically shallow and this is how people can be polymaths
- that AI is coming and all that is solid shall melt into air
- that most science is not real science
- that PhDs are not that hard cognitively
- that running your own business is freedom
- that tasks and goals are not metaphysical, can be quantised
- that rationality is not about rationality
- that most ideas have not been had, most projects have never been done
