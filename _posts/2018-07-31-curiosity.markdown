	— why, if a vessel be full and its lower part open, does water not issue from it unless the upper lid be first removed? <br>
	— when one atom is moved, are all moved? (since whatever is in a state of motion moves something else, thus setting up infinite motion.) <br>
	— why do winds travel along the earth's surface and not in an upward direction? <br>
	— why does a sort of perpetual shadow brood over the moon? <br>
	— granted that the stars are alive, on what food do they live? <br>
	— ought we regard the cosmos as an inanimate body, a living thing, or a god?

Another history of the origins of science: our long trek to <a href="{{gwas}}">GWAS</a>, <a href="{{chem}}">livermorium</a>, and <a href="{{cern}}">CERN</a> via astrology, natural magic, alchemy, Neoplatonism, herbalism, occultism, and philosophy. So, superficially, the book is just about an especially <a></a>fruity context of discovery. But this period holds two of the most important lessons in history: 

1. science grew out of work by people who diverge wildly from the modern idea and practice of science, whose variously false frameworks led to the Royal Society and e.g. the Newtonian triumph. (And from there to contemporary, professional, university science.) So wrong people can still make progress if their errors are uncorrelated with the prevailing errors. 

2. a small number of the most powerful people in Britain - the <a href="{{bigb}}">Lord Chancellor</a>, the <a href="{{phys}}">king's</a> <a href="{{harv}}">physicians</a>, <a href="{{chap}}">the chaplain</a> of the <a href="{{elec}}">Elector Palatine</a> & bishop of Chester, London's great <a href="{{wren}}">architect</a>, various <a href="{{priv}}">Privy Councillors</a> - successfully pushed a massive philosophical change, and so contributed to most of our greatest achievements: smallpox eradication, Sputnik and Voyager, the <a href="{{green}}">Green Revolution</a>, and the unmanageably broad boons of computing are partly theirs. <br><br>

		Bacon has some claim to being the most influential philosopher ever, in terms of counterfactual effect on history. (Rather than number of citations!) <i>No-one</i> with his social standing was resisting the Aristotelian consensus in 1620; his prototype scientific method is a century ahead of its time.<br><br> 
<!--  -->
		(Yes, <a href="{{hay}}">ibn al-Haytham</a>'s was 7 centuries ahead of its time, but to limited avail.)<br>
		(Yes, in fact <a href="{{induc}}">his biggest single philosophical doctrine</a> is shaky to the point of self-defeat. So it's philosopher <i>qua</i> person rather than philosopher <i>qua</i> philosopher.)

## What took so long?

All of the pieces of science are very <a href="{{anc}}">ancient</a> - we had mathematics and data collection <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322">well before the Ten Commandments</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus">naturalism</a> before Buddha and Confucius, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism#Greek_atomism">reductionism</a> before the Peloponnesian War at least <a href="http://tunesforbears.com/a-history-of-randomization/">one controlled trial</a> centuries before Christ, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/carneades/#3">fallibilism</a> likewise. Everything was ready BCE; we can see indirect evidence of this in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile">astonishing</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_screw">works</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesibius#Inventions">of</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byzantium#Devices">Ancient Greek</a> engineers, mostly unmatched for 1000 years until y'know. <br><br>

So the question is not "was Bacon the most original blah blah?": he wasn't, particularly when you remember Alhazen's Baconian method, from the C11th. But <a href="{{grace}}">we need an explanation</a> for how we managed to mess it up so badly. The received view, which is all I have at the moment, is that the fall of Rome, Christian anti-intellectualism and, later, the enshrining of Aristotelian mistakes was enough to destroy and suppress the ideas. I want deeper explanations though. (For instance, what did we do to the economy?)<br><br>



<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Alright let's say something about the actual book</h3>
	<div>
		Back to the book eh! Book structure is lots of little chapters on fairly disjointed topics: early modern ideas of space travel, universal language, pumps, etc. Chapter on "cabinets of curiosity" is great though: suddenly their dull zany blare makes sense and I want to build one:<br>
		<blockquote><br>this was more than a case of 'look what I've got'. The power with which Wunderkammern were imbued was... in that they created their own complete microcosm: a representation of the world in miniature... By possessing this microcosm the collector-prince was not just symbolising but also in a sense exercising his mastery of the world. The cabinet acted as a kind of mental laboratory within which the relationships between things could be contemplated via a process that shared elements of both experimentation and Gnostic revelation.<br>
		</blockquote><br>

		Ball doesn't like us calling the Scientific Revolution a revolution, and I agree: the revolution didn't consist in the theories of Bacon or Newton: it consists in the diffusion of the worldview into all subjects and all inquiry. It transformed society and gave us marvels, but it hasn't finished happening. The general will, or default state, is still strongly unscientific. (The largest and most grievous holdout, larger even than the enduring hold of <a href="{{fid}}">fideist</a> religion, is our tribal politics and our largely nonempirical government policy.)<br>
<!--  -->
		Ball expends a lot of time on a history of wonder vs curiosity vs <a href="{{hypo}}">fake</a> dispassionate robot inquiry. People hated all of these things for various reasons, up until the Renaissance when curiosity became acceptable on what are now <a href="{{bl}}">classic economic grounds</a>, or in line with the Italian cult of the virtuoso - someone who's so bloody brilliant that you have to just let him get on with it.<br>I always like Ball's drawling and catty editorialising.<br><br> 
<!--  -->
		(For instance, Margaret Cavendish - the darling of arts academics who latch on to the only woman in sight in this period - gets a round dissing by Ball, as an anti-experiment idiot, a vitalist, and a misogynist.)<br><br> 
<!--  -->
		Stimulating as always.
