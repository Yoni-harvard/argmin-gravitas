    If aesthetic experience is a terminal value, then more aesthetic experience is good.
    An existential catastrophe would halt all aesthetic experience and prevent any future aesthetic experience.
    So those who believe that aesthetics is a terminal value are bound to work on x-risk reduction, perhaps as their top priority, to protect the conditions for aesthetic experience.


(The argument generalises to all value systems except nihilism and absolute negative utilitarianism, I think.)
