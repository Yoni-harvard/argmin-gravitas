> the point of reading a manual is not to remember everything in it for later, but to later remember that something is in it.

My student recently received funding for independent study, and asked me for a reading list. "For computer science?" I asked. "For everything" said he.

## The Romance of Technology

This is my name for one of the most important emotions in the world: the love of what makes the world better, of technical knowledge. It's so underemphasised, I had to come up with a name. I learned very few technical topics until I realised what was beautiful and meaningful and philosophical about them. Computer science as intersection of philosophy and engineering. But greater than a mere intersection.
