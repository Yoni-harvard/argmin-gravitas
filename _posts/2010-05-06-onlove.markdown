<p></p><p>AND: You might argue that this is surplus, that "our culture is obsessed with all this shit, maan; most of our books and all of our poetry never shuts up about it, maan." Yes, it is, and they do. But there's a difference between bald usage and <em>received demand</em> for something and actual thought about it. This skirts mawkishness. But all mawk is is unguarded sentimentality, and I've been trying for readable unguardedness for some time now.


I dunno. If anything at all may be disqualified from the cold attention of crackly, analytic attention, then the unspeakable analysandum, love, is foremost. Because 1) it's a holism if it is anything; because 2) it seems small from outside; because 3) it is, fundamentally, <em>an uncomfortable thing to read about. </em></p><p>But as a culture we haven't moved on from (or even taken in) the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_words_for_love">four Greek words</a>, and we seem to be torturing ourselves over a vague mire borne of half-successful feminism and runaway adolescent bullshit.

It's this idea of love that we jump to first, that most would call "true love", and that many torture themselves over attaining and torture others by demanding. This, the ingrained, passionate, possessive blood-love. </p><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left">Augustine describes it as "eating one another up, as people do with their food." Consumption is the underlying drive; love is supposed to ignite you and burn you out, and capital-r-Romantic love has been seen as the desire to make another into ourselves.

Nietzsche calls it <span style="font-style: italic;">Natural</span> love, though he doesn't mean this well at all. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left">
One of the few people I've ever managed to speak properly to about this sort of thing to had a terrifying ideal: essentially, lovers as a fucking mind-meld, as an utterly unified entity. This seems the logical conclusion of Romantic, excessional eros, that bullshit which Twilight instantiates, and which is filed under "emo" with a couple of other deviant ideas, and thus disarmed and made ridiculous rather than scary. </div>

From Nietzsche on through the postmodern folk he accidentally gave breath to, we find antipathy to and critique of the great dumb thing, amour. Firstly, love is not a <a href="http://www.nbb.cornell.edu/neurobio/land/OldStudentProjects/cs490-95to96/hjkim/emotions.html">universal emotion</a>; a great many cultures studied apparently lack its characteristics. Even leaving aside the large and intimidating field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulamith_Firestone">Marxist</a> (and on through "French feminism") readings, love can be decried simply as a twinned egoism, stupid contentment, a smug sharing in the fact of one another rather than in any proper personal or communal cause.
</p><blockquote><span style="color: rgb(204, 153, 51);">
"Love, which was once believed to contain the Answer, we now know to be nothing more than an inherited behavior pattern.”
</span><div style="text-align: center; color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="color: rgb(204, 153, 51);"><blockquote></blockquote>- James Thurber

</span></div></blockquote><div align="left">
Less crunchily, we could talk about how much of love-praxis has the built-in premise:

<div style="text-align: center;">"P: My life revolves around my love."

<div style="text-align: left;">I can see why you'd want to resist this, being as it's slavish and <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,95210,00.html">surrender</a>-y, but it's also just <span style="font-style: italic;">true</span> for most emotionally alive folk in the world, right? Maybe amend it to "loves", i.e. favourite things, obsessions, and then I'd have to endorse it despite its problems.

</div></div>
Nietzsche went on about how love is actually an expression of the basic “deadly hatred of the sexes”; men and women fundamentally hate each other, and their relationships are the “war in its means”. This horrible idea is given development in Germaine Greer et al, when they talk about the artificiality of straight relationships and the extraordinary social structures that had to develop in order to get the genders to coexist.

Others agree that it's all an evolutionary and socially oppressive structure - an act of sublimated violence, and a base urge for control, possession and a steady supply of fucking.<a href="http://www.fallacyfiles.org/genefall.html"> (Genetic fallacy...)</a></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left">

"Volo ut sis" </span></p><p align="center"><span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">(I call you to being; I want you to be)</span></p><p>
So, here's the kernel that started all this off: "volo ut sis", an idea misattributed to St Augustine<a href="http://thescottishenlightenment.com/">:</a> the idea is that it's his name for ideal love. This is caritas, agape; God's love.

Hannah Arendt used it for the basis of a consistent political ethics; Volo ut sis is such a relation so as not to grasp or restrict the other. Some superlative form of respect, trust and encouraging warmth, with each ego trying not to impose itself on the other... </p><p>You do this by "sharing another's object" - that is, take on their reading of the world, and avoid dictating yours. It could be decried as pragmatic love, as head-love - merely <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/love/#SH2b">philia</a>? - since it sounds somewhat voluntary and cognitive. But I don't see such an objection coming from many folk who've actually ever had a lasting relationship.

It's the only evenhanded, sustainable kind I can see. And if animal <em>need</em> is lacking in this version of love, well, fine; fuck need. Eros is anyway nowt but cold, dead Faith. (Trust is earned; faith is given, and demanded, on credit.)

</p><p>"There is a class of emotions the members of which share the following
characteristics:</p><p>1) If a person <em>x </em>feels one of these emotions then it will always be possible for him to specify what it is 'about'.</p><p>2) If <em>x</em> feels the emotion <em>E</em>, and <em>y</em> is the object, then <em>x </em>believes <em>y </em>to have a specific set of properties.</p><p align="center"><span style="color: rgb(204, 153, 51);"><strong>∃</strong>Φ(<em>xy</em>)(<em>E</em>xy ⇒ B<em>x</em>Φ<em>y</em>)</span></p><p align="center"><span style="color: rgb(204, 153, 51);"></span></p><p align="left">
Φ cannot, of course, tell us much about the object<em> y </em>or how<em> y </em>appears to <em>x. </em>It is instead a <em>determinable quality, </em>which all objects which elicit <em>E</em> can be said to possess.</p><p align="left">3) <em>x </em>will therefore also believe that <em>y</em> has certain <em>determinate qualities</em> ψ and that it is due to these that <em>y</em> has the determinable Φ.</p><p align="center"><span style="color: rgb(204, 153, 51);">(xy)(<strong>∃</strong>ψ)(<em>Exy</em> ⇒ B<em>xψy</em>)</span></p><p align="center"><span style="color: rgb(204, 153, 51);"></span></p><p align="left">

There is a lack of symmetry in such reasoning with emotion: while it is sufficient for an emotional reaction to be unjustified if the beliefs involved are irrational, the rationality of such beliefs is not enough for their justification...</p><p align="left">The question I want to discuss here is whether love belongs to the class of emotions characterized by the conditions set out above and can be considered <em>justifiable...</em>"</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"></p><p align="center">

God, it's compelling. Like a car crash.

</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">I've ranted before that "Why do you love them?" is an empty question, simply answerless, since to do a <em>When Harry Met Sally</em> rundown is to formalise, and formalisations are never semantically cheap. No amount of language can ever really represent such complex phenomena. Further:</p><div align="left">
</div><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(204, 153, 51);"><blockquote></blockquote>"Love is not a feeling. Love is put to the test, pain not.

</span></p><div align="left"></div><div style="text-align: center;">Seems plausible to me ('not a sensation', that is, not 'not an emotion').</div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left">

When playing this analysis game I go further than Taylor; try these on: <em>

</em>1) Common received idea goes: "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXAU4MmMIMo">How can you love if you don't love yourself</a>?"<em>,</em> which is the claim that
<em>love is a reflexive relation:
</em>
<div style="text-align: center;">L<em>xy</em> ⇔ L<em>xx</em><em></em>
<em></em></div><div style="text-align: center;">
(Which, though a nice idea, doesn't hold.)
<em></em></div><em>

2) Better is the the logical claim that reciprocity is required, that
love is a symmetrical twoplace relation</em>:</div><div align="center">
L<em>xy</em> ⇔ L<em>yx</em> </div>
<div align="center">(That is, I'd deny that unrequited love deserves the full sense of the term.)</div><div align="center"></div><div align="center"></div><div align="center"></div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Most songs are about love, sex, or loving sex. Better: most are about the glory of it, wanting it, or heartbreak<em>. </em>There's little space for resenting its incursion into your business, or how it fucks up your social circle; being glad of the back of someone; pining because you're trapped in a shit relationship; or simply suddenly losing interest, all commonplace in life and missing in culture. (I suppose this is where grime comes in.)</div>

The dumped is always focalised; we don't have a decent cultural vocabulary in which to treat leavers or rejectors.

(Lamia - Keats)</div>
<br />"...Poor Lamia answer'd not.<br />He gaz'd into her eyes, and not a jot<br />Own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal:<br />More, more he gaz'd: his human senses reel:<br />Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs;<br />There was no recognition in those orbs.<br />"Lamia!" he cried - and no soft-toned reply.<br />The many heard, and the loud revelry<br />Grew hush; the stately music no more breathes;<br />The myrtle sicken'd in a thousand wreaths.<br />By faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased;<br />A deadly silence step by step increased,<br />Until it seem'd a horrid presence there,<br />And not a man but felt the terror in his hair.<br />"Lamia!" he shriek'd; and nothing but the shriek<br />With its sad echo did the silence break.<br />"Begone, foul dream!" he cried, gazing again<br />In the bride's face, where now no azure vein<br />Wander'd on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom<br />Misted the cheek; no passion to illume<br />The deep-recessed vision - all was blight;<br />Lamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white..."<br /><br /><div align="left">

IRL, none of these are reason enough for the spurned. So once you find yourself with one of them, the search for a <em>pretext</em> to leave begins. (The most common being the orifices of another person.)</div>
