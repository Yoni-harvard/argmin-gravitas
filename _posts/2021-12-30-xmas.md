## 1. Ruminate

wound-licking 

## 2. Hibernate

No obligations. The failing of strength, or husbanding.

Whisper.

## 3. Innocence, or regression to innocence

## 4. Family

## 5. Cynic, degenerate, based, imp of the perverse

I am amazed by how people <a href="{{g}}">think they're clever</a> for thinking of talking about dark things at Christmas, or for noting that commerce and culture often go together in unclear causal directions.

## After cynicism

You'll never be innocent again. In some ways the iron has entered you. In some ways you feel less than you used to. But you don't have to go gently. You don't have to pretend that this is strength, or sophistication, and that actually you haven't lost anything.



## 6. The New Possibility

I am an almost total void of spiritual feeling. I struggle to regard anything at all as sacred. Music gives me an echo.

John Fahey, a believer, called his xmas album _The New Possibility_: the hope borne of the turning point, not of one year, but of all of history.

'Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy' strikes me as one of the finest things I've ever heard.

'Sister Winter' is hibernation followed by jubilation.
