The Institute for Progress just published [our elaboration](https://progress.institute/can-policymakers-trust-forecasters/) on our previous work on experts vs amateur forecasters.

* We cut a bunch of introductory material which you can see [here](https://arbresearch.com/files/intro-to-forecasting.pdf).
* Most of the goodness is hidden in the links, like [the literature review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TEc53aKmy8uQwOMegdigCsvWsbJI_w41mlcFg4yuVCk/edit) which compares each pair of forecasting methods.
* See also [this list](https://arbresearch.com/platforms/) of forecasting platforms open to you.
