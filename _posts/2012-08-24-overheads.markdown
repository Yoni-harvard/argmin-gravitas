Average time used for basic upkeep of the organism, on a weekday:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>7 hours sleep. (29%)</li>
<li>1.5 hours <a href="{{comm}}">commute</a> (8%).</li>
<li>7 hours <a href="{{work}}">production</a> (29%)</li>
<li>0.5 hour hygiene (2%)</li>
<li>0.5 hour shopping (2%)</li>
<li>0.5 hour exercise (2%)</li>
<li>1.5 hours <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/420719/time-spent-cooking-per-week-among-consumers-by-country">cooking/eating</a>. (8%)</li>
</ul>

= Leaving 5.5 hours for actual, discretionary life (23%).<br>


The above time is not <i>waste</i>, since each of them have their own pleasures, since some fraction of people would perform their jobs even without pay, and since (unfocussed) cognition continues throughout them. (Most delightfully in the form of <a href="http://showerthoughtsofficial.tumblr.com/">shower thoughts</a>.) But it is still unfree. 

Three possible reactions:

* Rage against the dying of the day. <a href="{{traz}}">Optimise</a>, race, and <a href="{{ass}}">cut</a>. I focus on this route.
* Mindfulness.
* Quiescence.

> expecting a large increase in the average (treating it as a latent variable in being spread across many measured variables) is entirely missing the value of productivity. It’s not that one gets a lot done across every variable, but one gets done the important things. A day in which one tidies up, sends a lot of emails, goes to the gym, walks the dog, may be worse than useless, while an extraordinary day might entail 12 hours programming without so much as changing out of one’s pyjamas.

Ways to get your life back:<br><br>

<ul style="list-style: none;

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 hour saved on sleep <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Zeo#melatonin-analysis">from oral melatonin</a>.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 hour off commute by taking public transport (for reading)</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Or + 1.5 hours off commute by working from home)</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Or + 0.5 hour from cycling your commute)</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.5 hour saved on lunch <a href="{{comp}}">from having a 'complete meal' shake</a>.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.4 hour off shopping from home delivery</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.2 hours by taking caffeine & theanine in pills instead of boiling up hot decoctions.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 hours from becoming a crusty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeganism">freegan</a> (8 hours off work 1.5 off commute, 0.5 off hygiene).</li>
</ul><br><br>

The most effective strategy for preventing waste of life is hard to quantify in terms of hours per day: it is the behaviour implied by the expression "<i>proceed til apprehended</i>". Job requirements are often nonsense. Surveillance is (so far) gappy. Guards are indifferent. Meetings can usually be skipped. <i>Some</i> red tape is purely decorative: not even the demanding authority thinks it matters. (There are of course many, many situations where the spell is inapplicable, like anything to do with the police or military or sex.)<br><br>

And "<a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/"><i>Objectively, should I care?</i></a>".
