Average time used for basic upkeep of the organism <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>, on a weekday:<br>

<ul>
    <li>7 hours <a href="{{sleep}}">sleep</a>. (29%)</li>
    <li>7 hours <a href="{{work}}">production</a> (29%)</li>
    <li>1.5 hours <a href="{{comm}}">commute</a> (8%).</li>
    <li>1.5 hours <a href="{{cook}}">cooking/eating</a>. (8%)</li>
    <li>0.5 hour <a href="{{shower}}">hygiene</a> (2%)</li>
    <li>0.3 hour <a href="{{exercise}}">exercise</a> (1%)</li>
    <li>0.3 hour <a href="{{shop}}">shopping</a> (1%)</li>
</ul>

= Leaving 6 hours for actual, discretionary life (25%).<br>


The above is not exactly <i>waste</i>, since each of them have their own pleasures, since some fraction of people would perform their jobs even without pay, and since (unfocussed, mostly non-meaningful) cognition continues throughout them. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a> But it is still unfree. 

Three possible reactions to the realisation that 75% of your time is not wholly yours:

* _Quiescence_. Many people seem to spend their 25% on screens and tidying.<br>

* _Mindfulness_. Maybe what's bad about the above ratio is in our head, and maybe close attention to the world around us can make the above meaningful.<br>

* _Rage_. Fuck that: <a href="{{traz}}">Optimise</a>, race, and <a href="{{ass}}">cut</a>.

# Against the dying of the day

> expecting a large increase in the average (treating it as a latent variable in being spread across many measured variables) is entirely missing the value of productivity. It’s not that one gets a lot done across every variable, but one gets done the important things. A day in which one tidies up, sends a lot of emails, goes to the gym, walks the dog, may be worse than useless, while an extraordinary day might entail 12 hours programming without so much as changing out of one’s pyjamas.

How do we get life back?:<br>

<ul>
    <li>1 hour off commute by taking public transport (used for reading)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>(Or + 1.5 hours off commute by working from home)</li>
        <li>(Or + 0.5 hour from cycling your commute)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Maybe 0.5 hour saved on sleep <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Zeo#melatonin-analysis">from oral melatonin</a>.</li>
    <li> 0.5 hours saved on lunch <a href="{{comp}}">from having a 'complete meal' shake</a>.</li>
    <li> 0.4 hours off shopping from home delivery</li>
    <li> 0.2 hours by taking caffeine & theanine in pills instead of boiling decoctions.</li>
    <li> 7 hours by finding work you really think should be done. And by you.</li>
    <li> 10 hours from becoming a crusty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeganism">freegan</a> (8 hours off work 1.5 off commute, 0.5 off hygiene).</li>
</ul><br>

The most effective strategy for preventing waste of life is hard to quantify in terms of hours per day: it is the behaviour implied by the expression "<i>proceed til apprehended</i>". Job requirements are often nonsense. Surveillance is (so far) gappy. Guards are largely indifferent. Meetings can usually be skipped. Some red tape is purely decorative: not even the demanding authority thinks it matters. <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a><br><br>
