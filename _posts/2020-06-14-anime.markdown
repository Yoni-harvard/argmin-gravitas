_Context: my hobby is getting into things, new parts of culture._

<br>

For years I wrote off anime as a junk medium, incontinent and sleazy. This is not totally unfair: most of it is crass wish fulfillment. Even after understanding what's good about it I still qualify my scores (below) with a secondary score of how affected, crass or exploitative each is. I don't have to do this for country or punk!


The essence of manga is exaggeration. Eyes, swords, reactions, and yes bodies.

Squeaking.



## Some key questions for probing your own distaste:

<br>

#### "Why don't I like it? Do I not like the people who like it?"


<br>

#### "Do my friends dislike it?"

<br>

#### "Does it offend me? Is it ugly? Low class? Pretentious?"


<br>

#### "What is it trying to do?"

<br>

#### "How would I have to change to get it?"





### 1. Canon. 

### 2. Technicalities

#### Jargon


#### conventions 


#### techniques


<br><br>

### 3. Material conditions

Brutal.
