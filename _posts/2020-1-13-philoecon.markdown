_I was an angry young man. One of the targets of my ire was academic economics. Until the spell of Mirowski and the heterodoxy, I found myself smarter than thousands of people who knew more than me and worked harder than me._

_Part of this was double standards: "social science must be perfect to be legitimate" - where social theory, an interpretation of society, needs no grounding besides eloquence and grandeur._

<blockquote>We can only conclude that economics, as studied in our universities, is the astrology of the Machine Age... In science the final arbiter is not the self-evidence of the initial statement, nor the facade of flawless logic that conceals it. A scientific law embodies a recipe for doing something, and its final validation rests in the domain of action.

My problem with economics stretches to every major question of scientific methodology: from defining the field; to quantifying its domain; the relationship between a science’s methods and object; examining its fundamental principles; to the role of simplifying assumptions; a large family of issues regarding evidence’s limited role (“econometric methodology”); the supposed distinction between positive, normative, and applied uses of theory; the role of normative concerns in science; the rhetoric of economists; the role of conformism or pluralism; to in what sense economics even has scientific status. Though I do not have space to address all of these here.

Call the dominant paradigm _purist economics_ (PE).

<!-- How many heterodox are there? Data is sparse. One historian of economics, Frederic Lee, estimates the proportion of contemporary dissenters as “5 or 10 percent” (in Hayes, Christopher (2007), ‘Hip Heterodoxy’, The Nation, http://www.thenation.com/article/hip-heterodoxy?page=0,1) -->

Call the dominant theories in the paradigm mainstream economics. The more common name is ‘neoclassical’ economics, but this obscures its object in two respects – firstly historically (because the original ‘neoclassicals’ were C19th economists, and were quite different from our contemporaries) and, secondly, because the term is made to cover two orders of explanation (‘neoclassical economics’ being used for both the dominant theories, and the meta-theory that orchestrates them). Problems with economics fall into three groups: the technical, the philosophical and the institutional. These sets are not independent, and might be characterised by the causal chain:

Fig.1. quasi-Marxist model of the methodological problem of economics
And though simplistic, there is something to this. I thus include a section on explicitly institutional factors. I will not discuss technical failures in this essay, mainly because of the considerable insider knowledge they require. (But lack of predictive power is the key one, and that is conspicuous to non-technicians – as in the Great Recession of 2008-Present.)

One respected economic methodologist, Uskali Maki, has a warning for people like me: "Economics is a very complex subject, and any given account of it will only highlight some of its limited aspects, serving only limited purposes. Overgeneralized and oversimplified accounts abound, and they are just that: overgeneralized and oversimplified."
<!-- Maki, Uskali (2008) ‘Realism from the ‘lands of Kaleva’: an interview with Uskali Mäki’, Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics, 1, Autumn 2008, p.124-146. -->
 
Say that purist economics is a cluster centred on the following beliefs:

1. Love of precision, i.e. of quantitative results in a Newtonian mould.
2. Love of abstraction, born of the belief that maximising abstraction will give the model maximum relevance. 
3. Monomathematical. That mathematical modeling is the defining tool of economics –“I came to the position that mathematical analysis is not one of many ways of doing economic theory: It is the only way. Economic theory is mathematical analysis. Everything else is just pictures and talk.”
<!--  Lucas, Robert (1986) in Lives of the Laureates, ed. Breit and Hirsch (MIT Press; 1986) p.279 -->
4. Methodological individualism. (2) compels us to focus on idealised unitary objects: analysis must deal with discrete units if certain mathematical tools are to begin to work.
5. Micro reductivism. (3) entails a quixotic search for the 'microfoundations' of macro-phenomena, because otherwise they cannot be said to be theoretically 'real'.  
6. That Lionel Robbins’ 1932 definition of the field is the salient one: “Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between given ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.”
<!--  Robbins, Lionel (1932) An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science, p.15 -->
7. Rational Choice theory. That utility theory is the basis for modelling human behavior. This squashes all human experience to one dimension: utility, all you can get. That economic rationality is and only is utility maximisation. In supplying unfalsifiable behavioural premises, the above combine to make PE largely deductivist.
<!--  This view was most influentially stated in Friedman, Milton (1953) "The Methodology of Positive Economics" in his Essays In Positive Economics (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1966), pp. 3-16 -->
8. One-dimensional men. (6) dictates that explanation of any given human action should be in terms of prudence (i.e. greed). Put technically: "an agent's unbounded monotonic utility maximisation". In fact: economic explanation is to demonstrate that agent A optimises some variable x.

9. Platonic belief in equilibrium. That explanation of a given economic phenomenon is simply the identification of its ‘equilibrium’ (that idealised point where forces co-ordinate and stabilise the system). Equilibria are taken to be ubiquitous. Price determination is the primary product of analysis.

10. Heroic assumptions. The precise quantitative standards set by (1), (3) and (8) imply very restrictive and unrealistic assumptions about human behaviour, typically perfect information (that agents are all-knowing), perfect rationality (narrowly construed) and unbounded monotonic utility maximisation (that our wants are unlimited).

11. Imperial scope. From (6); that economic analysis can be rightly applied to any human behaviour. All decisions have an internal logic based on (7)&(9).

12. Methodological instrumentalism. Since they require patently false stipulations, the above heavily motivates the position that only the power of one's results matter in analysis, not the starting premises.7

13. 1920s-grade Positivism. That economics can be neatly split into positive and normative methods - and that the former can be value-free. That politics and economics are separate. 

14. The futility thesis: Philip Mirowski notes that NE theories fit a pattern: most end with "some assertion that the world is so structured and interlinked that anything one might wish to accomplish will be offset ... resulting in a return to the original situation..." (see (9).)

## Philosophical failures

### PE’s questionable scientificity


Edward Lazear, a powerful policy-maker, gives PE's understanding of itself: 
<blockquote>Economics is not only a science, it is a genuine science. Like the physical sciences, economics uses a methodology that produces refutable implications and tests these implications using solid statistical techniques...
</blockquote>
 <!-- Lazear, Edward (1999), ‘Economic Imperialism’ http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/lazear/personal/pdfs/economic%20imperialism.pdf  --> 
 Let us see.  

Here is a general schema for evaluating a science:
1. What kind of science is it?
2. Are its goals scientific?
3. Are its methods scientific? 
a. Are its foundations empirically founded?
b. Does it proceed empirically? 
c. Is it falsifiable?
d. Is it consilient with the natural sciences?    
4. Are its conclusions scientific? 
a. Does it find laws? 
b. Is it predictively powerful?
c. Is it explanatory?
d. Does it make progress?

And – pace Lazear – for PE the answer to each of (2)-(4) is ‘no’. (Note that these questions address what the goals, methods and conclusions of the field have been – but it is vital to ask in addition what they ought to be.)
First: What kind of science is economics? We can answer this by either studying economists’ practice or by analysing their objects. Let us try to characterise a typical macroeconomic phenomenon: it has intentionality; it is what Hilary Putnam calls “thick” (i.e. inextricably evaluated as it is described); it is essentially contingent and dynamic; it is overdetermined; formally indeterminate; it is reflexive (i.e. can react to theory); and controlled experimentation is often practically and ethically impossible. Figure 2 is my attempt to capture the problem with calling PE a ‘genuine’ (that is, hard and natural-like) science. I use ‘science’ in the older, broader sense of ‘a systematic way of understanding empirical events’:
<!-- Putnam & Walsh (2009) The End of Value-free Economics -->

The error is complex: purists speak as if economics were equivalent to natural science when it is more often a merely formal science (living as it does in a corner of pure mathematics) – and when it should be a policy science.

The intuitive split they rely on is between ‘fact-based’ science and ‘value-based’ ethics; effectively an attempt to apply positivism to humans. This split is contentious even in natural sciences, but simply inadmissible in social ones. Facts are interpreted, and there are dimensions of intentional objects (like actions, beliefs, desires and utility) that cannot be properly understood at all without reference to psychology and phenomenology. After Gunnar Myrdal, I argue that social science must aim at verstehen (participatory understanding) as well as begriefen (understanding of causal mechanisms).
<!-- Myrdal, Gunnar (1954) ‘Implicit Values in Economics’ in The Political Element in the Development of Economic Thought, trans. Streeten. (Cambridge; Harvard University Press;1954) -->
Analysing the origins of PE, Philip Mirowski finds that it reconstructed itself in the image of physics, taking up Newtonian goals (quantitative results, maximum precision, predictive power, begriefen).
 <!-- Mirowski, Philip (1989), More Heat Than Light: Economics as Social Physics, Physics as Nature's Economics -->

 In the name of objective economics, the primogenitors of purist economics – most significantly Leon Walras, Vilfredo Pareto, and Lionel Robbins – intentionally depsychologised, depoliticised, denormativised economics, eventually arguing that the market wholly sidestepped issues of justice. But wrestling with the problems of a ‘human physics’ led to PE resembling pure mathematics far more than physics. In practice, PE is a formal science with pretensions to synthetic knowledge. An ideal economics would be far closer to law or history than to physics. So, regarding schema question (2): its goals are indeed scientific – but nonetheless unjustifiable and unattainable, in context.

The practical problem with PE is that its claim to hard science serves to falsely elevate economists’ policy advice, and immunise the field to criticism from non-economists (and even to economists who are not monomathematical). Warren Samuels lists the many things that PE actually is: "...economics could be seen as science, as political and moral philosophy, as ideological self-projection by the people of the Euro-American nations and their way of earning a living, as both derived from & generally reinforcing the existing structure of power, privilege & so on."
 <!-- Samuels, Warren (2011) Erasing the Invisible Hand, p.1 -->

 This leads us on to PE’s problems attempt to avoid normativity.

<br><br>

## The ‘Value-free’ myth
Here is a reconstruction of a common intuition in PE, and an application of it:  

<ul>
    P1. The world is value-pluralist. (People disagree on what matters.)<br>
    P2. So to take any normative view is inevitably to make yourself unobjective. (To be universal, one must be value-neutral.)<br>
    P3. Real sciences are objective; so real sciences are value-neutral.<br><br>
    <!--  -->
    P4. Economics is scientific.<br>
    P5. So economics must be value-neutral. (3&4)<br>
    P6. So economics can yield objective facts about economies.<br><br>
    <!--  -->
    P7. The market aggregates the values of all individuals into a price. <br>
    P8. Price is not normative because it is just a neutral channel for individuals to establish a group value.<br>
    P9. So market price is an objective value (an intersubjective summary of participants’ values). Price circumvents value judgments.<br>
    C. So by utilising market data, economics can give objective policy advice. (5&9)
</ul>

We have already argued against P4. But the implicit normativity of economics goes beyond the intentionality of its objects: the limits of empiricism are more keenly felt out in social science. Some general processes that militate against this neat argument:

* _Naturalisation of contingencies_. John Lanchester summarises one of these limits well: “Empiricism, because it takes its evidence from the existing order of things, is inherently prone to accepting as realities things that are merely evidence of underlying biases and ideological pressures. Empiricism, for Marx, will always confirm the status quo.”
<!--  Lanchester, John (2012) ‘Marx at 193’, London Review of Books, http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n07/john-lanchester/marx-at-193 -->

* The necessity of interpretation. And Lanchester continues into a second issue, the theory-ladenness and interpreted nature of all facts: “[Marx] would have particularly disliked the modern tendency to argue from ‘facts’, as if those facts were neutral chunks of reality, free of the watermarks of history and interpretation and ideological bias and of the circumstances of their own production.”
<!-- Lanchester, John (2012) ‘Marx at 193’, London Review of Books, http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n07/john-lanchester/marx-at-193 -->

* The normativity of definition and of emphasis: The tools decide the issues that can be addressed. As Samuels put it, “Phenomena do not come with the label "economic" attached to them.”
<!-- Samuels, Warren (2011) Erasing the Invisible Hand: Essays on an Elusive and Misused Concept in Economics (US; Cambridge University Press ; 2011), p.1 -->

* The Duhem-Quine Thesis is particularly dangerous in economics, since testing takes place in the presence of very dubious auxiliaries. Hausman: “if one is unable to place much confidence in the other premises needed to derive a prediction P from an hypothesis H, then there is a serious practical problem. Indeed it becomes almost impossible to learn from experience. This is the situation in economics”
<!--  Hausman (1992), p.307 -->

* Performativity of economics. The above all hold in, for example, physics. But there is little scope there for dangerous smuggled normativity and performativity found in economics. Economic propositions are performative in the sense that their subject matter covers not simple mechanistic events, but intentional objects that are often blends of belief and event – e.g. “I am happy” – and of illusion and reality – e.g. “Capitalism is natural”. Also in the sense that successful theory can affect economic processes, because economic actors can read it and alter their behaviour. (In Donald MacKenzie’s phrase, theory is “an engine, not a camera”.)

The above combine to make empirical data generally insufficient to strongly guide researchers in theory-choice. Another conclusion we can draw is that economies cannot be separated from the political and social system within which they are embedded; neither can economics. The attempt to make economics objective was well-motivated – but misguided. The subtraction of ethical concerns from the field led to worse policy and falser claims.
<!--  For an account of the most recent (2000s) example of PE leading to awful policy, see Colander et al (2009) -->

#### Formalism -> Omitted variables

The overwhelming focus on mathematical modelling leads to distortion in PE’s subjects. (Again: one’s tools decide the issues that one can address.) PE proceeds by marginalising or omitting what it cannot formally represent. We have seen the results of omitting ethics from analysis, but the omissions actually amount to far more – most of what actually determines economic life: personality ("heterogenous decision rules"); dynamic social contexts; time; path-dependency; competition; preference management; processes of resource distribution; ideas (entrepreneurship); transaction costs; profit; and vital non-economic coordination, like law. <!--  List is from Keen (2011), -->
If and when this process is conceded, the word ‘exogenous’ (meaning simply ‘external to the model’) is used to avoid explaining the variable. 
In applied science, there is a trade-off between the relevance and precision of one’s model. PE denies this trade-off, and ends up maximising precision at the expense of their model’s realism: abstraction, in the end, guarantees applicability only at the cost of vacuity.
 
#### Ahistoricism

Perhaps 90% of the world’s economics departments operate within PE; almost none of these teach history as standard, and an increasing number have no historians of economic thought.
<!--  Colander, David (2008), The Making of an Economist Redux (Princeton; Princeton; 2008), p.12 -->
This indifference to history (as pedagogical or theoretical source) actually serves to keep PE dominant. Daniel Garber gives a methodological argument in favour of philosophers doing philosophy of history, one which transfers well to our case. [Economists] should study history 
<blockquote>not because the past is a source of arguments and positions that may be helpful in current debates - though it is that - but for a more important reason… History gives us fresh views of what philosophy has done and so can do - of what it was and so can be. And this is what is needed by problem-solvers today.
</blockquote> 
<!--  Schneewind, JB (2006) review of Analytic Philosophy and History of Philosophy http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24982-analytic-philosophy-and-history-of-philosophy/  -->

Claim: Study of history is intrinsically harmful to dogmatism, because it contextualises one’s work and paradigm.

<!-- VS: Huemer on hist of phil -->

#### Institutional failures

Economics gets called the 'queen of the social sciences', with General Equilibrium its 'crown jewel'. This holds – but only if we think of PE as Lewis Carroll’s Queen of Hearts – i.e. jealous, duplicitous, and overbearing - and GE as a rhinestone. I do not think paradigms are avoidable – but, as with any monopoly, there are risks attendant on it. Some negative consequences of economics’ paradigmatisation:




#### Internal tyranny

There is a wilful incommensurability in PE: “Sneering is the obstacle to conversation in economics. The Chicagoans sneer at the Marxists, the Marxists sneer at the Neoclassicals, the Neoclassicals sneer at the Austrians, and the Austrians sneer at the Chicagoans. C < M < N < A < C.” 
<!--  McCloskey, Deirdre (1994), Knowledge and Persuasion in Economics, p.349 -->
I have deemed PE a paradigm, so in one sense we cannot expect there to be anything but strict enforcement of methodology. But, on the model of biodiversity, here is a strategic argument for scientific pluralism:
    1. Science is provisional; it can be replaced at any time. (This caution is motivated by Larry Laudan’s 'pessimistic meta-induction': the realisation that all past theories have been superceded - so if we are to infer anything from the past, it is the likelihood of our theory’s future refutation.)
    2. Any given science always faces anomalies, mysteries, tensions, and critique.
    3. If a whole community is of the same research programme, and meets a persistent anomaly, then the whole science is blocked and undermined by it.
    4. Pluralism gives the field alternative paths and approaches, increasing the chance of incorporating anomaly.
    5. Methodological pluralism is the enlightened option (since (1), (2) and (4)). 

And a further argument from efficiency can be made: a very great part of the field is concerned with “static equilibrium conditions”, that is, on finding one special list of prices at which all the products of an economy will be bought and sold at a particular point in time. To use the language of economics: in chasing over-idealised and inapplicable research programmes, PE results in gross misallocation of scarce intellectual resources.


Insularity

One response to the demand for pluralism is: "Why must every academic try to speak about everything? Why can't the other social sciences pick up the touchy-feely bits of the work?" 

This is a fine point but for 1) the intellectual imperialism of economics (the attitude and method described by our cluster criteria has spread to other fields, and occluded human issues there too). Also 2) the performativity of economic theories: economic education alters the worldview of economists, many of whom go on to do ethically-loaded policy work with a false sense of objectivity. And finally: 3) economics has been too closed-off from other departments to make that question's implied division of mental labour possible: citation analysis (volume of non-economics papers quoted in economics) shows it to be the most isolated large field outside of pure mathematics. (Thomson Reuters (2012) Web of Knowledge database, http://isiknowledge.com/) No less a purist than Hayek knew the danger of this insularity: “...nobody can be a great economist who is only an economist - and I am even tempted to add that the economist who is only an economist is likely to become a nuisance if not a positive danger.”
<!--  Quoted by Erik Lundberg at the ‘Nobel’ ceremony for Hayek and Myrdal, http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1974/presentation-speech.html -->
 Sociologists call the process of making a new field distinct from others ‘boundary work’: it involves inventing a jargon and asserting one’s scientific credentials.

The strategic argument for pluralism given above maps easily on to this. Hausman puts it drolly: “The only legitimate reason to dismiss all work of other social scientists as of little interest would be if the separate science of economics were a smashing success.”
<!--  Hausman, Daniel (1992) The Inexact and Separate Science of Economics, p.254 -->



Applied cacophony

Despite the methodological enforcement outlined above, even canon PE economists fail to agree on almost every actual real-world application of the theory. 
<!-- Gregory Mankiw inadvertently illustrates this when he lists the substantive matters that at least three-quarters of economists agree on: the list is only 14 propositions long! http://gregmankiw.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/news-flash-economists-agree.html   -->
The cause of this has been euphemised as “the art of economics” (as if this were not truly a failure of the science at all). But this raises the question: is PE in fact a paradigm? In Kuhn’s work the term implies consensus on method and on most substantives. So this could be a further block to PE’s claim to hard-scientific status: it lacks the ‘univocity’ of a Kuhnian mature science. If so, economics suffers the disadvantages of paradigmatisation without the primary benefits: power and univocity.
<!--  Though it clearly does get some benefits, e.g. collective organisation of research and immunity to outsiders. -->

Anti-philosophical methodology 
“…without exception, we all share philosophical background assumptions and presuppositions. The penalty of not doing philosophy isn't to transcend it, but simply to give bad philosophical arguments a free pass.”
- David Pearce
<!--  Pearce, David (2012) comment on http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/r7dui/david_pearce_ama/ -->

Methodology is a science’s site of self-reflection and self-criticism. The above problems are as universal and intractable as they are because PE’s methodology disparages work on methodology: if it is considered at all, it is deemed a “misallocation of scarce intellectual resources”. Economists can literally merely cite Friedman’s 1953 paper and go on with an inconsistent faux-positivist faux-Popperianism. This attitude to methodology could be justified, if the paradigm had demonstrated its success and scientific rigour – but, to put it mildly: this is not the case. 

In conclusion: PE’s methodology has been seen to be an opportunistic blend of positivism, misused Lakatosian ideas, and inapplicable natural-science methodology. (Most of my conclusions apply to microeconomics more than macroeconomics, but some processes are shared.) Figure 3 is my composite of effects:

<center>Fig.3. A slightly more sophisticated historical model.</center>


As a result of these(largely unintended) features, the paradigm could not shift despite sustained criticism, the accumulation of serious anomalies, and the availability of multiple well-developed alternatives. It remains to be seen if that titanic anomaly, the current ‘Great Recession’, will overcome purist economics’ strong inertia.
