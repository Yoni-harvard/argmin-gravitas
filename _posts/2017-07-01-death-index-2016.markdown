Definition of 'preventable'.

What is preventable shifts. Malaria was unpreventable until quinine was popularised in 1830; cholera was unpreventable, the Times going so far as to say.

I mean "could have been stopped given current knowledge and resources".


With current technology and law, what deaths could have been prevented for less than Â£1m?

Amenable

Clear
	Diarrhoea
	Malaria

Grey
	Tobacco

Exclusions
	Senescent death
