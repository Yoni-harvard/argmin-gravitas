Status replaces achievement

* Honours are easier to understand than actual achievements
* Honours are easier to obtain than actual achievements(?)


It replaces achievement on wikipedia. No editor can resist mentioning a MacArthur Genius Grant or a UN special appointment.

It's not the same thing as achievement. But this to say that it _replaces_ achievement at the sharp end. It's hard to discover something new, it's easy to pick up another honorary degree.
