Status replaces achievement

* Honours are easier to understand than actual achievements
* Honours are easier to obtain than actual achievements(?)


It replaces achievement on wikipedia. No editor can resist mentioning a MacArthur Genius Grant or a UN special appointment.

Everyone knows it's imperfectly correlated with achievement. But this is equivalent to saying that it replaces achievement at the sharp end. It's hard to discover something new, it's easy to pick up another honorary degree.
