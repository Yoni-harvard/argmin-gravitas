<small>(A ramble occasioned by <a href="{{philo}}">Cheryl Misak's biography</a> of Frank Ramsey, but not a review of it.)</small>

</center>


<br>

> [Ramsey, aged 17] turned to Ogden and said: ‘Do you know, I’ve been thinking I ought to learn German. How do you learn German?’ Ogden leaped up instantly, rushed to the shelf, got him a very thorough German grammar — and an Anglo-German dictionary — and then hunted on the shelves and found a very abstruse work in German — Mach's Die Analyse der Empfindungen — and said: ‘You’re obviously interested in this, and all you do is to read the book. Use the grammar and use the dictionary and come and tell us what you think.’ Believe it or not, within ten days, Frank was back saying that Mach had misstated this and that he ought to have developed that argument more fully, it wasn’t satisfactory. He’d learned to read German — not to speak it, but to read it — in almost hardly over a week.

> “<a style="color: #828282" href="{{s}}">A Mathematical Theory of Saving</a>”... is, I think, one of the most remarkable contributions to mathematical economics ever made, both in respect of the intrinsic importance and difficulty of its subject, the power and elegance of the technical methods employed, and the clear purity of illumination with which the writer’s mind is felt by the reader to play about its subject.

<center>– <a href="{{k}}">Keynes</a></center>

<br>


> There was something a bit abnormal about Frank. He was so huge in body and in mind, so much bigger and better... that I suspected that... his cells might have double the number of chromosomes... While still an undergraduate Frank had attacked Keynes on... probability and had shaken him to the core. But this precocious intelligence was combined with a childlike innocence...<br><br>The result was very curious. When I brought to his notice some ordinary tale of petty self-seeking, self-deception or malice, Frank was at first astounded. Such things did not seem possible to him up there in the heights. Then he would realise the full implications and humour of folly and silliness, and the self-defeating nature of selfishness and spitefulness, and God-like, his great innocent face would become wreathed in smiles and then he would chuckle. And his chuckle was the chuckling of a god.

> I don't feel the least humble before the vastness of the heavens. The stars may be large, but they cannot think or love; and these are qualities which impress me far more than size does...<br><br>  My picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The foreground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny bits... In time the world will cool and everything will die; but that is a long time off still, and its present value at compound discount is almost nothing. Nor is the present less valuable because the future will be blank. Humanity, which fills the foreground of my picture, I find interesting and on the whole admirable. I find, just now at least, the world a pleasant and exciting place. You may find it depressing; I am sorry for you, and you despise me. But I have reason and you have none; you would only have a reason for despising me if your feeling corresponded to the fact in a way mine didn't. But neither can correspond to the fact. The fact is not in itself good or bad; it is just that it thrills me but depresses you. On the other hand, I pity you with reason, because it is pleasanter to be thrilled than to be depressed, and not merely pleasanter but better for all one's activities.

<br><br>


OK, OK, just one more encomium: [Franz Berto](https://twitter.com/Franz_Berto) calls Ramsey "the counterfactual greatest philosopher of the 20th Century" (i.e. he would have been it, if he hadn't died at 26). He's one of my favourite people, a model personality as well as a titanic brain. Just a big jolly bastard. He is loveable -- it is right for Misak and us to call him <a href="{{f}}">Frank</a>, where we would never call Wittgenstein "Ludwig" (let alone Luki) or even Russell "Bertie".

In a handful of years he founded a couple of subfields of mathematics, a couple in economics. He produced the greatest theory in epistemology <a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7">7</a>, and one of [the most radical notions](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey-economics/#ZeroDiscFutuWellBein) in ethics. Filtered through about 5 successors, these upended my life. He was a Bayesian before Jeffreys and de Finetti; a longtermist before the Bomb.

But even massive nerds haven't heard of him. I just polled my philosophy degree mates, and only 2 of 10 had, and only then because of his link to the Cult Wittgenstein.

This is probably because he's way too mathematical for the <a href="/jvn">novelist-journalist-historian-biographer complex</a> that determines popular stature. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a> Someday I will write an Explain Like I'm Five for all sixteen of his publications.

Enough ass-kissing, what did he do?


<br>

## Achievements


* <a href="{{theorem}}">Ramsey's theorem</a> (founding example of <a href="{{rt}}">Ramsey Theory</a>, the study of inevitable order). This was done in passing, for his groundwork in extremal graph theory (Ramsey Numbers). <a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6">6</a>
* <a href="{{sent}}">Ramsey sentences</a>: the first working scheme for positivist shenanigans
* Ramsey’s theory of truth: it's either <a href="{{troth}}">redundant or prosentential</a>. 
* <a href="{{rep}}">Ramsey’s theory of preference</a>
* <a href="{{rgm}}">The Ramsey growth model / optimal saving theory</a> (in passing, the first longtermist)
* <a href="{{tax}}">Ramsey theory of optimal sales tax</a> (in passing, also <a href="{{price}}">Ramsey pricing</a>)
* **<a href="{{prob}}">Ramsey’s theory of probability</a>**: rigorous subjectivism. Very early coherence theorem, first Dutch book theorem, foundations of modern utility theory and decision theory.
* Ramsification <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>


It is difficult to speak of achievements in philosophy: one man's achievement is another's reductio. But I mostly find his positions extremely sensible and they obviate large portions of philosophy for me.

* _Deflationism_: you basically never need the concept of "truth", only sufficiently strong probability. Somehow over the 10 years since learning this I have actually internalised it and feel oddly above one of the all-time philosophical debates.
* reliabilism about knowledge
* functionalism about meaning and mind
* "best systems" approach to scientific law
* expressivism about causal statements
* indexical analysis of tensed statements
* Decision theory as a way to make some (minimal) progress in ethical theory

I settled on half of these before reading him, so I am doubly struck by how relentless sensible he is -- or at least how temperamentally similar to me.

<br>

#### Misc 

Jesus but people love naming things after him -- even more than <a href="/hume">Hume</a>. I moved the ones he didn't really invent here, among the merely social achievements:


* Translator of last resort for Wittgenstein's _Tractatus_ (aged 18)
* Vector of pragmatism into English philosophy. Progenitor of Wittgenstein II.
* <a href="{{test}}">The Ramsey Test</a>, an entry into the very clever and extrememly stupid seeming debate about conditional statements. This is named after him because he mentioned it in a footnote of an unpublished paper!
* Ramsey's maxim: "it is a heuristic maxim that the truth lies not in one of the two disputed views but in some third possibility which has not yet been thought of, which we can only discover by rejecting something assumed as obvious by both disputants." Plain language Hegel.
* He wrote the definitive rebuttal to a <a href="{{sc}}">crank ideology</a> poised to take over British Labour. The MMT of its day.
* Torpedoed Keynes' book on probability.


These fit into 9 years of work and 16 papers. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>

<div class="accordion">
    <h3>Was Ramsey the first longtermist?</h3>
    <div>
        Or the first quantitative longtermist: someone with an explicit <a href="{{ze}}">zero time discount</a> on social welfare. Who would treat the future as they want to be treated.
        <br><br>
        Yes! In the classic line I quoted above, he says "<i>In time the world will cool and everything will die; but that is a long time off still, and its present value at compound discount is almost nothing.</i>" But we can safely discount this as a witticism, given the derivation in the optimal saving paper.<br><br>
        <blockquote>[to discount later utilities is] ethically indefensible and arises merely from the weakness of the imagination.</blockquote>
        <br><br>
<!--  -->
        Who else? <a href="{{sid}}">Sidgwick</a> already got the point informally: <br><br>
        <blockquote>the time at which a man exists cannot affect the value of his happiness from the universal point of view; and that the interests of posterity must concern a Utilitarian as much as those of his contemporaries, except in so far as the effect of his actions on posterity – and even the existence of human beings to be affected – must necessarily be more uncertain.</blockquote>
    <!--  -->
        But <a href="{{ben}}">Bentham was positive discount</a> (fn6). Mill had thought about personal time preference and was extremely annoyed by people discounting there, but nothing on social discounting. 
    </div>
</div>

<br>

## Humanism, pragmatism, altruism, fun

On top of those is his philosophy of life / demeanour. Keynes again:

> His bulky Johnsonian frame, his spontaneous gurgling laugh, the simplicity of feelings and reactions, half-alarming sometimes and occasionally almost cruel in their directness and literalness, his honesty of mind and heart, his modesty, and the amazing, easy efficiency of the intellectual machine which ground away behind his wide temples and broad, smiling face, have been taken from us at the height of their excellence and before their harvest of work and life could be gathered in.


He is a model of genius without pretensions, cynicism, abuse of others, or self-conscious tragedy. An important model, if only to show up the many people who think that suffering is deeper than fun or that intelligence is a great burden. Sir, you're no Frank P Ramsey.

<br>

Nihilism is bizarrely popular, given how unpleasant it is to experience. So I also love him for his simple beautiful arguments against it.

<!-- > "My picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The foreground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny bits... I apply my perspective not merely to space but also to time. In time the world will cool and everything will die; but that is a long time off still, and its present value at compound discount is almost nothing.<br><br>
Nor is the present less valuable because the future will be blank. Humanity, which fills the foreground of my picture, I find interesting and on the whole admirable. I find, just now at least, the world a pleasant and exciting place. <br><br>
You may find it depressing; I am sorry for you, and you despise me. But the world is not in itself good or bad; it is just that it thrills me but depresses you. On the other hand, I pity you with reason, because it is pleasanter to be thrilled than to be depressed, and not merely pleasanter but better for all one’s activities." -->

> Although the study of classics and mathematics is very valuable, more valuable, perhaps, than other games like chess, yet it is difficult to see that proficiency at it is a sufficient reason why a man should not do his share of the world’s work, give something to his fellows in exchange for the meat and drink they give him... Geometry is doubtless [a] more divine amusement... but what excuse is that... [to] not give up his amusement to save his creatures from their present miserable condition?’

<br>

### Influence

Almost entirely indirect, through Keynes, Wittgenstein, Carnap, Samuelson, etc. Dying young wasn't good for his memes (unlike with young musicians) and he quickly became obscure. 

So we had to rediscover half of his work. But this means we can make a good tragic estimate of how far ahead of the curve he was, since we're basically in the control group: 

* 11 years ahead of de Finetti; 
* 28 years ahead of <a href="{{boi}}">Boiteux</a>; 
* 44 years ahead of <a href="{{dm}}">Diamond and Mirrlees</a>
* 46 before <a href="{{lewis}}">Lewis</a>
* 48 before <a href="{{grover}}">Grover</a>
* etc 

Aged 26, he was PhD advisor for Wittgenstein (aged 40) PhD advisor. He inspired lots of Wittgenstein's _Philosophical Investigations_; opinions vary on whether Ramsey was Hume to his Kant or Bernoulli to his l'Hôpital. Frankly he makes Wittgenstein look contrived.

<br>


## Misak on Ramsey

> His instincts, in all parts of his life, were straightforward and directed to the facts.

> Roy Harrod: "Ramsey's intellectual process is at white heat; but the style is delightfully cool, like that of some old naturalist taking one for a ramble in the country and making desultory observations."

Sporty despite being ungainly and hyperintellectual.

It is tragic that he wasted months of his life (2% of it) with Freudians who were unfit to treat him -- among all people they were unfit to treat.

<br>

Winchester:


> The seventy scholarship boys lived in a damp and cold fourteenth-century building. The chambers were unheated—central heating was installed only in 1987, after the students built a snowman inside one of the chambers and it stayed intact for the duration of the term. Freezing morning baths, quickly in-and-out, were not optional.

> The war had a deleterious effect on the food, which at Winchester was at the best of times awful. Its quality had been known to give rise to correspondence in The Times... Once they were given boiled rhubarb leaves as a vegetable, only to discover the next day that they could have died from eating them... The boys who couldn’t buy food from the school shop were always hungry.

Interesting that the "scholars" [scholarship boys] were higher status than the "commoners" [fee-paying]

> The primary issue was the length of the day, which officially started at 6:45 in the morning and went straight through to 8:45 in the evening. Lessons began at 7 am, and late risers did without their cup of tea and two weevily biscuits. But the junior boys had a much more arduous time of it than the official story let on. As one of the youngest, it was Frank’s duty to get up at the first sound of the bell at 6 am and ‘call’ or wake up the dormitory.

> Frank took life seriously and did not like being made fun of

> The police themselves went out on strikes during 1918–19. A revolutionary socialism now seemed a real possibility.

> <a href="{{san}}">Charlie</a> would no doubt turn in his grave if he knew that the only reason anyone still reads his history of the Wilson family is to find out about those two left-wing nephews.

> "The reason people say this is the happiest time of one’s life is simply that... most people... will never again possess despotic power as he does now. He can be witness judge and executioner all in one; he can abuse juniors as he will never-again be able to abuse people . . . He can go about imagining he is upholding the foundations of College and talk rot about prefectorial dignity and people being above themselves and can beat people as he did Asquith for being ‘solitary’."


Cambridge:

> "We really live in a great time for thinking"

> He would become the singular mind who could engage each of those
great thinkers—Keynes, Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein—on their own terms. There would be simply no one else who could do that, including these four themselves. At the least, Keynes and Moore weren’t up to Russell’s logical skills and Wittgenstein, Russell, and Moore weren’t up to Keynes’s skill in economics.

> In the elite world of Cambridge University in the early 1920s, being vaguely pro-Bolshevik was not a particularly radical stance... The infamous Cambridge spies of the 1930s would be drawn from the circle of Frank’s friends.

### Of his time

He established things that will outlast you and me and our memory, but he was also caught up in the manias of his day. He was an unconflicted socialist; he caught the anti-masturbation fad; and he devoted months and months of his short life to being psychoanalysed. <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a>

Rather than quaint fads, maybe it's good to view these as early experiments in living, as modernity weakened the trad death grip. Probably I am equally timebound in some way or other. (Music taste, most likely.) No shame in it.

His economic work is a rebuttal of silly accusations about the field's ideology being simple and overdetermined by right-wing politics: his theories of tax and saving are still central despite being about active governments and a wealth tax. (Never mind <a href="{{sam}}">Samuelson</a> and Arrow; never mind the vast Keynesian contingent who ruled for 50 years.) More generally: Ramsey had a strong ideology tamed by his decency and his mathematics. He was that happy thing, a reasonable and productive partisan.

    <h3>Karl Sabbagh on Ramsey</h3>
    <div>
        Someone wrote a tiny biography of Ramsey before Misak. Sabbagh is fairly obsessed with Frank's sex life, but he also managed to interview the last person who knew him.<br>
        His teen diary:
        <blockquote>Wonder what I shall do for schedule B. Feel inclined to geometry but I’m such a bad visualiser. Depressed about myself. Seem to have no energy and hard to learn any maths. ... I think what would suit me would be to go off to a nice place alone with only maths books and a novel or two where I could work and walk. Hoping for a reaction from this slackness as I was much like this before last term but this term will be so exciting as last.<br><br>
        Went to Mikado. It is a glorious show<br><br>
        Did accounts. Have spent £86 5s since beginning of academical year, reckon ought to do pretty comfortably on my £250.<br><br>
        Really angry with myself re sex. Woe unto them that desire things that give no satisfaction. I will be a puritan.<br><br>
        I do hope I’m not impugning my health but haven’t the guts to talk to a doctor.
