> [Ramsey, aged 17] turned to [CK] Ogden and said: ‘Do you know, I’ve been thinking I ought to learn German. How do you learn German?’ Ogden leaped up instantly, rushed to the shelf, got him a very thorough German grammar — and an Anglo-German dictionary — and then hunted on the shelves and found a very abstruse work in German — Mach's Die Analyse der Empfindungen — and said: ‘You’re obviously interested in this, and all you do is to read the book. Use the grammar and use the dictionary and come and tell us what you think.’ Believe it or not, within ten days, Frank was back saying that Mach had misstated this and that he ought to have developed that argument more fully, it wasn’t satisfactory. He’d learned to read German — not to speak it, but to read it — in almost hardly over a week.

> “A Mathematical Theory of Saving”... is, I think, one of the most remarkable contributions to mathematical economics ever made, both in respect of the intrinsic importance and difficulty of its subject, the power and elegance of the technical methods employed, and the clear purity of illumination with which the writer’s mind is felt by the reader to play about its subject.

> There was something a bit abnormal about Frank. He was so huge in body and in mind, so much bigger and better than the rest of us, that I suspected that... his cells might have double the number of chromosomes as those of ordinary men... While still an undergraduate Frank had attacked Keynes on the subject of his theory of probability and had shaken him to the core. But this precocious intelligence was combined with a childlike innocence...<br><br>The result was very curious. When I brought to his notice some ordinary tale of petty self-seeking, self-deception or malice, Frank was at first astounded. Such things did not seem possible to him up there in the heights. Then he would realise the full implications and humour of folly and silliness, and the self-defeating nature of selfishness and spitefulness, and God-like, his great innocent face would become wreathed in smiles and then he would chuckle. And his chuckle was the chuckling of a god.

[Franz Berto](https://twitter.com/Franz_Berto) calls Ramsey "the counterfactual greatest philosopher of the 20th Century" (i.e. he would have been that, if he hadn't died at 26). And he's one of my favourite people, a model personality as well as a titanic brain. He was just a big jolly bastard. It is right to call him Frank, where we would never call Wittgenstein "Ludwig" (let alone Luki) or even Russell "Bertie".

In a handful of years, he founded a couple of subfields of mathematics, a couple in economics, produced the greatest theory in epistemology, and one of [the most radical notions](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey-economics/#ZeroDiscFutuWellBein) in ethics, which has upended my life. A Bayesian before Jeffreys and de Finetti; a longtermist before the Bomb.

But even massive nerds haven't heard of him. I just polled my philosophy degree mates, and only 2 of 10 had heard of him, and only because of his link to the Cult Wittgenstein.

This is probably because he's too mathematical for the novelist-journalist-historian-biographer complex that determines popular stature. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a> Someday I will get around to writing an Explain Like I'm Five for all 16 of his publications.

Enough ass-kissing, what did he do?

## Humanism, pragmatism, altruism, fun

But alongside these is his philosophy-of-life or anyway his demeanour. Keynes again:

> His bulky Johnsonian frame, his spontaneous gurgling laugh, the simplicity of feelings and reactions, half-alarming sometimes and occasionally almost cruel in their directness and literalness, his honesty of mind and heart, his modesty, and the amazing, easy efficiency of the intellectual machine which ground away behind his wide temples and broad, smiling face, have been taken from us at the height of their excellence and before their harvest of work and life could be gathered in.

He models a genius without pretensions, without cynicism, without abuse or neglect, and without self-conscious tragedy. This is an important model, if only to show up the many people who think that suffering is deeper than fun and intelligence is a great burden. You're no Frank Ramsey.



> "My picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The foreground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny bits... I apply my perspective not merely to space but also to time. In time the world will cool and everything will die; but that is a long time off still, and its present value at compound discount is almost nothing.<br><br>
Nor is the present less valuable because the future will be blank. Humanity, which fills the foreground of my picture, I find interesting and on the whole admirable. I find, just now at least, the world a pleasant and exciting place. <br><br>
You may find it depressing; I am sorry for you, and you despise me. But the world is not in itself good or bad; it is just that it thrills me but depresses you. On the other hand, I pity you with reason, because it is pleasanter to be thrilled than to be depressed, and not merely pleasanter but better for all one’s activities."

> Although the study of classics and mathematics is very valuable, more valuable, perhaps, than other games like chess, yet it is difficult to see that proficiency at it is a sufficient reason why a man should not do his share of the world’s work, give something to his fellows in exchange for the meat and drink they give him... Geometry is doubtless [a] more divine amusement... but what excuse is that... [to] not give up his amusement to save his creatures from their present miserable condition?’


### Influence

Really not much directly. Dying young wasn't good for the spread of his results (unlike the musician case) and he quickly became obscure. So we had to rediscover half of his work. But this means we can make an excellent tragic estimate of how far ahead of the curve he was: 11 years ahead of de Finetti; 28 years ahead of <a href="{{boi}}">Boiteux</a>; <b>44</b> years ahead of <a href="{{dm}}">Diamond and Mirrlees</a>...  <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>

* Aged 26, he was Wittgenstein's (aged 40) PhD advisor. He inspired some amount of Wittgenstein's _Philosophical Investigations_; opinions vary about whether this was as Hume to his Kant or Bernoulli to de l'Hôpital.



## Misak

> His instincts, in all parts of his life, were straightforward and directed to the facts.

> Roy Harrod: "Ramsey's intellectual process is at white heat; but the style is delightfully cool, like that of some old naturalist taking one for a ramble in the country and making desultory observations."

Sporty despite being ungainly and hyperintellectual. Heroic


### Winchester
    - The seventy scholarship boys lived in a damp and cold fourteenth-century building. The chambers were unheated—central heating was installed only in 1987, after the students built a snowman inside one of the chambers and it stayed intact for the duration of the term. Freezing morning baths, quickly in-and-out, were not optional.
    - The war had a deleterious effect on the food, which at Winchester was at the best of times awful. Its quality had been known to give rise to correspondence in The Times... Once they were given boiled rhubarb leaves as a vegetable, only to discover the next day that they could have died from eating them... The boys who couldn’t buy food from the school shop were always hungry.
    - [Interesting that the "scholars" [scholarship boys] were higher status than the "commoners" [fee-paying] ]

> The primary issue was the length of the day, which officially started at 6:45 in the morning and went straight through to 8:45 in the evening. Lessons began at 7 am, and late risers did without their cup of tea and two weevily biscuits. But the junior boys had a much more arduous time of it than the official story let on. As one of the youngest, it was Frank’s duty to get up at the first sound of the bell at 6 am and ‘call’ or wake up the dormitory.
- Frank took life seriously and did not like being made fun of
- The police themselves went out on strikes during 1918–19. A revolutionary socialism now seemed a real possibility.
- Charlie would no doubt turn in his grave if he knew that the only reason anyone still reads his history of the Wilson family is to find out about those two left-wing nephews.
- "The reason people say this is the happiest time of one’s life is simply that... most people for e.g. Foot will never again possess despotic power as he does now. He can be witness judge and executioner all in one; he can abuse juniors as he will never-again be able to abuse people . . . He can go about imagining he is upholding the foundations of College and talk rot about prefectorial dignity and people being above themselves and can beat people as he did Asquith for being ‘solitary’."


### Cambridge

> "We really live in a great time for thinking"

> He would become the singular mind who could engage each of those
great thinkers—Keynes, Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein—on their own terms. There would be simply no one else who could do that, including these four themselves. At the least, Keynes and Moore weren’t up to Russell’s logical skills and Wittgenstein, Russell, and Moore weren’t up to Keynes’s skill in economics.

> In the elite world of Cambridge University in the early 1920s, being vaguely pro-Bolshevik was not a particularly radical stance... The infamous Cambridge spies of the 1930s would be drawn from the circle of Frank’s friends.



### Of his time

Although he established much that will outlast you and me and our memory, he was also caught up in the manias of his day. He was a staunch socialist, caught the anti-masturbation fad, and devoted months and months of his short life to being psychoanalysed.

(He was also in a slightly mishandled open relationship with his wife, which seems more prescient than Bloomsbury-quaint.)

Rather than quaint fads, maybe it's good to view these as early experiments in living, as modernity weakened the death grip of the trad.

I suppose I am equally timebound in some way or other. (Music taste, most likely.) I suppose there's no shame in it.

His economics offer a neat rebuttal to naive accusations about the field's polarised ideology: his theories of tax and saving are still central to the field, despite being about modelling active governments and a wealth tax. (Never mind Samuelson and Arrow, never mind the vast Keynesian contingent.) More generally he is a happy case of a strong ideology tamed by mathematics, of a productive partisan.

    <h3>Was Ramsey the first longtermist?</h3>
    <div>
        Or the first quant longtermist: zero discount, to treat the future as you would want to be treated.<br><br>
        [Sidgwick](https://www.libraryathena.com/the-methods-of-ethics_69) already got the point: 
        <blockquote>the time at which a man exists cannot affect the value of his happiness from the universal point of view; and that the interests of posterity must concern a Utilitarian as much as those of his contemporaries, except in so far as the effect of his actions on posterity – and even the existence of human beings to be affected – must necessarily be more uncertain.</blockquote>

        <a href="{{ben}}">Bentham was positive discount</a> (fn6). Mill thought about personal time preference (and was extremely annoyed by people's discount there). Can't see anything about social rate of discounting.

    <h3>Karl Sabbagh on Ramsey</h3>
    <div>
        Someone wrote a tiny biography of Ramsey before Misak. He is fairly obsessed with Frank's sex life, but he also managed to interview the last person who knew him.
        <!--  -->
        His teen diary:
        <blockquote>Wonder what I shall do for schedule B. Feel inclined to geometry but I’m such a bad visualiser. Depressed about myself. Seem to have no energy and hard to learn any maths. ... I think what would suit me would be to go off to a nice place alone with only maths books and a novel or two where I could work and walk. Hoping for a reaction from this slackness as I was much like this before last term but this term will be so exciting as last.<br><br>
        Went to Mikado. It is a glorious show<br><br>
        Did accounts. Have spent £86 5s since beginning of academical year, reckon ought to do pretty comfortably on my £250.<br><br>
        Really angry with myself re sex. Woe unto them that desire things that give no satisfaction. I will be a puritan.<br><br>
        I do hope I’m not impugning my health but haven’t the guts to talk to a doctor.
        </blockquote>
