> There are eight levels of charity, each greater than the last. The 
greatest, above which there is no other, is to strengthen another by 
giving him a gift or free loan... to strengthen his hand until he need no 
longer beg...

or

> ... as experience has proved, I believe, without a single exception, that 
poverty and misery have always increased in proportion to the quantity 
of indiscriminate charity, are we not bound to infer... that such a mode 
of distribution is not the proper office of benevolence?

This is my undergraduate economics dissertation, on certain pessimistic analyses of foreign aid. Rather than tackle the impossible question "<i>To what extent has aid caused net socioeconomic development, in general, over 70 years</i>?", it picks an easy one: "<i>Is aid so bad we need to stop it</i>?"

It has some good bits - I anticipate the <a href="{{itn}}">"Important/Neglected/Tractable" model</a>, carefully read a bunch of ideologically opposed people with an enormously weird idea, and I note the functional similarities of left-wing and right-wing radicalism. But it's light on theory; this is history by someone who doesn't do historiography, macro by someone who couldn't solve <a href="{{dsge}}">DSGEs</a>, and econometric meta-analysis by a near-illiterate. Even so, I think it shows what <i>literary</i> kinds of research can and can't do (roughly: great questions, no great answers).<br><br>

	<h3>tl;dr</h3>
	<div>
		Government-to-government aid was pretty bad for like fifty straight years, 1950 through 2005. This conclusion doesn't depend on your ideological stance <a href="#fn:0" id="fnref:0">0</a>. <a href="{{bucket}}" target="_blank">Lots got wasted, lots got stolen, lots was thrown at stupid ideas, lots was used for naked realpolitik</a>, and almost no one measured what almost any of it actually ending up doing. It still did a lot of good, surprisingly.<br><br>

		Various clever people have claimed aid is so bad it has to stop. (For literally hundreds of different little reasons, but the big main one is<br><br>

		<ol>
			<li>Aid increased greatly over the C20th.</li>
			<li>Poverty among recipients mostly didn't decrease.</li>
			<li>Nudge nudge wink wink, quite a correlation eh?</li>
		</ol>

		.) However, the evidence about aid is even weaker than usual for economics, so this claim isn't warranted by the crap evidence. Sorry.<br><br>

		Health interventions are the only aid we can confidently say is <i>really</i> good, though other things could be. Eradicating smallpox was such an amazing thing to do that it balances out literally everything bad about aid. Not that bad aid should get away with it.<br><br>

		ODA probably is still pretty bad, but people started making encouraging noises in 2005. Haven't checked since 2012, soz.
