Like so much of Paul Graham's writing, <a href="{{pg}}">his new piece</a> seems shallow and unsupported on first reading. But there's a great model of the world in it, and rare suitably-hedged advice. You don't need to believe that any of YCombinator's reflected glories are actually glorious to take something from it.

I recently ran a couple of related sessions for my students. (It takes an hour to run the following exercises -- but if you're honest with yourself that's less than it'd take you to read the original.)

<br><br>

* How many areas have you seriously tried working in?
* What havenâ€™t you tried but want to? <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>
* What are you a natural at?
* What are you excessively curious about?
* What have you mastered? What are the gaps at the frontier of that?
* What would you do in a basic-income world?
* If you took a break from "serious" work to work on something interesting, what would you do? 
* What _intersections_ of things have you mastered? <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a> Anything <a href="{{bor}}">specific and boring</a>?
* What is the hardest you have ever worked without an external deadline?
* How many independent projects have you done? (No teacher, no boss, no company, no manager)
* What open questions are you holding in your head right now? Have you actually tried to answer them? <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>
* What is the most _delighted_ you have been while working?
* Who are you trying to impress? Is that who you should?
* Cultivating luck: how many <a href="https://colah.github.io/personal/micromarriages/">microfounders</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/voLJhDWKmiQ4J6pqD/beyond-micromarriages">micromuses</a> are you accruing every day?
