I got a lot of fully-subsidised education: more than 20 years' worth. In educated circles this is seen as an unalloyed good; I am thought to have benefited both myself and society <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>. But I find myself seriously concerned that I actually wronged people with the latter 10. Say there are four kinds of benefits from education.<br>

{%   include ed/two.html  %}

Wonderful things! But if the social ones aren't larger than the social cost, then state education will tend to be taking from society and giving to those who happen to be above-average in nerdiness. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>

Is education a good deal overall, _including for people who don't get it_? I can't actually resolve this question in less than a book. The algorithm is

1. enumerate the (confusing, mixed, methodologically flawed evidence for) benefits and costs
2. put them on a common scale
3. take the ratio

The following is just part of step 1.

<br>

## How to think about education's social benefits

We should distinguish private returns (pay, increased confidence, increased knowledge, increased social capital for you) from social returns (productivity, political contributions, cultural reproduction if you like). The former are good, incredibly good, but not a matter for government policy insofar as they include zero-sum benefits, and if there are better ways to spend public funds.


### Productivity

Are educated people more productive? Yes. But did their education cause this? <a href="{{card}}">To some extent</a>!

The reason to pay particular attention to the economic side of the social return is not that money is the most important thing, but because anything that doesn't give net economic returns can't be kept up without trading off against something else, like infrastructure, or social care, or life-giving research, or (let me dream) the <a href="/x-for-all">fate of the world</a>.

#### R&D

You might note that academics produce a large proportion of all inventions and new ideas. This too is confounded: science was _more_ productive  when university intakes were 1% of current levels. And the relationship between basic science and technology is less straightforward than it seems.

### Intelligence

Two of the most careful psychologists I know came out with <a href="{{rit}}">an astonishing result</a>: that education actually improves cognitive abilities, perhaps 3 points per marginal year. (Clearly this wouldn't scale indefinitely, but even at normal 10 year levels it's a remarkable effect.) And it was a n=600,000 meta-analysis of 142 analyses.

If this doesn't astonish you, then you haven't being paying attention to just how hard it is to raise intelligence (except by correcting malnutrition or severe pollution).

If this estimate is on the correct order of magnitude, then while there are massive private benefits to this effect, the social gains from more capable citizens will be huge.

### Noneconomic gains

The humanist response is that educating your citizens produces huge noneconomic public goods, like critical thought or voluntarism or political purpose or empathy or taste or cultural continuity ("pass it on!"). 

The private noneconomic return is enormous, larger than the huge private economic return, for some people. e.g. 4 years of relative freedom, away from home, surrounded by bright horny people can be very good for your later worldview, life goals, and mental health. You get space to build yourself new. Or if not build, then to locate yourself in culture, philosophy, and personality space.

But again, what matters in policy terms is the relative size of social gain and social cost.


#### Knowledge

_this section is incomplete_

This is quite easy to check: how much do people remember from uni, for how much of their lives?

* Doctors have forgotten all of their basic science training 5 years out

(I remember being scandalised by some of my peers selling all their textbooks _as soon as_ they graduated. But clearly they knew more about social reality than me.)

Cultural continuity - preserving the knowledge and ideas of past generations - depends on a mixture of education and autodidacts. I don't know what the value of preserving a tradition of Hegelianism or <a href="{{can}}">Canadian Irish studies</a> is.

But people know this isn't the real reason for education, because they instead emphasise metacognition, "learning how to think":


#### Critical thinking

There's a <a href="{{crit}}">small, diminishing, and temporary</a> effect on critical thinking. (Humanities degrees <a href="{{nous}}">do not</a> stand out, incidentally.)

#### Virtue

_this section is incomplete_

This is in the same vein as the old "reading novels makes you empathetic" research programme.

I have no idea if this is generally true - I was a critical voluntarist before university, the most empathetic people I know did not go to university, and most of my Arts peers emerged with none of these things - but I can tell you I had a very good time. And this, the self-justifying private fulfilment, gives me reason to worry about society's end of the bargain. It'd be very convenient if what (bookish and middle-class) people found most personally fulfilling was also the best thing for all.


#### Politics

_this section is incomplete_

Does it make people engage more with actual politics? (Not just social media talk: volunteering, running.)

Does it make people more tolerant and cosmopolitan?


<br>

## What's the social cost?


### Money

{%  include ed/calc.md    %}

Are there better ways to spend £90k per person? (<a href="{{give}}">Yes</a>: but let's limit it to UK recipients.)

* personal tutor at PhD level, <a href="{{hours}}">3 hours</a> a day for three years.
* infrastructure
* poverty alleviation

<a href="#1-wealth-for-all">Then there is the great radical alternative: giving everyone an independent income</a>.



### Time

Primary and secondary education takes at least 15,000 hours of the most curious and vital years _of everyone alive_ <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a>. Billions of hours of fruitless boredom. Literacy and numeracy are probably worth this on their own, so factor out primary school, for only 6000 hours of confiscated life.

### Suffering

You probably know someone who was traumatised by their school years. Even if only 5% of pupils suffer this much, it throws a huge shadow over the social benefit. But even boredom, or unfreedom, or being forced to associate with cruel people count. (One suggestive result: closing schools for coronavirus was correlated with a <a href="{{anx}}">20% drop in teen anxiety rate</a>.)

People who suffer from uni are rarer, but I've met <a href="{{kp}}">a few</a>. They are totally ignored in the discourse, in favour of the Ennobling Creation of Citizens or 4 Year Crazy Party memes.



### Credential inflation as perverse redistribution

_this section is incomplete_

Using school as the main signal of employability is terrible for the many people who cannot handle bureaucracy, being told what to do, pointless makework, or authority. Autodidacts are amazing but rare and rarely respected as much as they should be.

Caplan's contention is that the wage premium of degree-holders mostly comes at the expense of non-degree-holders.

(Other costs: student debt distress, bondage.)

<br>

## What's the alternative?

### 1. Wealth for all

The most dramatic counterfactual: <a href="{{ssc}}">the government just giving you the money</a> they would have spent on you, after 20 years of investment returns:<br><br>
  <!--  -->
  <blockquote>
    what if the government had taken this figure and invested it in the stock market at the moment of your birth? Today when you graduate college, they remove it from the stock market, put it in a low-risk bond, put a certain percent of the interest from that bond into keeping up with inflation, and hand you the rest each year as a basic income guarantee. How much would you have?<br><br>
    <!--  -->
    $15,000 a year, adjusted for interest. We can add the $5,800 basic income guarantee we could already afford onto that for about $20,000 a year, for everyone. Black, white, man, woman, employed, unemployed, abled, disabled, rich, poor. Welcome to the real world, it’s dangerous to go alone, take this. What, you thought we were going to throw you out to sink or swim in a world where if you die you die in real life? Come on, we’re not that cruel.
    <!--  -->
    So when we ask whether your education is worth it, we have to compare what you got – an education that puts you one grade level above the uneducated and which has informed 3.3% of you who Euclid is – to what you could have gotten. 20,000 hours of your youth to play, study, learn to play the violin, whatever. And $20,000 a year, sweat-free. 
  </blockquote>
  <!--  -->


### 2. Grad tax

The above could be taken as an argument for fees: "the individual plausibly benefits more than society, so let them cough up a bit". But substantial fees are pretty much a shitshow, certainly in the high-interest, <a href="{{debt}}">inexorable</a>, cartelized form that exist England and America, where the prices are uniform and useless. But (if we cannot tear down this credentialist bullshit, as below) then certainly a graduate tax is fully justified.


### 3. Regulating credential pollution

Rather, we should replace the hegemony of higher education - make it so that young people don't need a degree to get decent jobs, or in fact most jobs (besides doctor and pilot and so on). 

In extremis, we could make education a protected category in job interviews. We would rely on actual portfolios, entry tests, and work trials (which are open to all and actually measure the relevant quantities) instead of pompous paper. (Aptitude tests are illegal in some American industries, so you'd have to reverse that first.) This would be a more powerful intervention against inequality than free fees, because it would catch the <a href="{{sk}}">many smart people</a> who do not fit the conformist, examination form of 'training'.

It might take something as radical as this to stop students defecting against each other and continuing the ruinous cycle. (Besides making education level a discriminatory question, a full basic income would work, too.)

The problem with equalising the status of graduates and nongraduates is that higher education is fêted by absolutely bloody everyone: parents, governments, giant corporations, reptilian economists, frothing radicals, whether anarchists, neoliberals, or Juche cadres. (Everyone except a minority of libertarians.) The uniqueness of its cross-cultural appeal means that it is presently the only way that young people can possibly get 4 years of relative freedom to locate themselves, and to do so surrounded by people from all around the world, and to do so in an atmosphere which rewards many kinds of deviance.

You could maybe do this by funding (voluntary) international service; basically giving working-class kids some gap years, too. The cult of travel is nearly as powerful as the cult of school, after all.

    <h3>Higher Ponzi</h3>

        Above I argue that academia might be supporting the lucky at the expense of the unlucky. I don't touch the great internal pathologies of academia, the bureaucracy (with <a href="{{r}}">maybe 70%</a> of researchers' time spent on non-research stuff), or the exploitation of the junior to support the senior.<br><br>
        <!--  -->
        Expanding the student intake causes credential inflation, which feeds back to expand the next student intake, but it also expands the number of academic jobs, which props up the PhD / adjunct grinder.

		    My great-grandfather, Jock Middleton, left behind an amazing library. He was a farmer and a <a href="{{lbc}}">Left Book Club</a> member, so it includes hefty stuff like Marx and Kropotkin, and froth like Bertrand Russell's late social works. (The best book of all in it is Richard Crossman's incredible <a href="{{god}}">anthology of early deconversions</a> from Stalinism.)<br><br>
<!--  -->
		    My granda (who ended up farming the same land) used to grouse about this, 70 years later: he complained that Jock bought books instead of buying him shoes. He never read any of them, just stuck them in the attic for a lifetime, for me to eventually find.
