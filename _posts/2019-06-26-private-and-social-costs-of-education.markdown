How much does it cost to make an intellectual?

There's the usual outlay, which in the UK was about Â£100,000 [cite].

Then there's normal state education. Then there's a degree. Autodidacts are amazing but rare and rarely respected as much as they should be.

    <h3>Appendix: Jock the radical</h3>
    <div>
		My maternal great-grandfather, Jock Middleton, left behind an amazing library. He was a farmer and, like so many at the time, a <a href="{{lbc}}">Left Book Club</a> member, so it includes hefty stuff like Marx and Kropotkin, and froth like Bertrand Russell's late social works.

		(But the best book of all in it is Richard Crossman's incredible early anthology of deconversions from Communism.)

		Jock's son, my grandfather, used to grouse about it, 70 years later, by complaining that Jock bought books instead of buying him shoes. He never read any of Jock's books.
