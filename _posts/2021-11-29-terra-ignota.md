<blockquote>Palmer’s series suggests [that] science fiction should not be viewed as just another literary genre, but as the genre where Enlightenment—the hopes for radical human self-improvement, the dream that we might collectively control our own fate as a species, the determination to transcend our own limitations — takes refuge in an anti-Utopian age that seems determined to deflate any such ambitions... Its ambitions and achievements far surpass... the limited imagination of fictions that confine themselves to representing everyday life. More than philosophy or political theory, science fiction is the genre through which our age joins what Palmer calls the Great Conversation.</blockquote>

Regarding "[Terra Ignota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Ignota)", a series of novels by Ada Palmer:

This series is a lot of things. It is the most sustained fictional portrait of <a href="{{arch}}">Archipelago</a> and <a href="{{po}}">polystates</a>, one of the few utopias I would maybe like to live in. Palmer <i>starts</i> in an Enlightenment utopia (post-war, post-nationalism, post-scarcity, post-gender, post-theocracy, post-fideism, post-meat, post-capital-punishment, post-nuclear-family, general justice via universal voluntary surveillance) and then shows what the tensions will do to any system that has to handle humans as we are.

About half of readers find the prose unbearably clotted and affected. (If you've read books from more than two hundred years ago you'll have some immunity.) I loved the many didactic discursions - e.g. de Sade's Christian name being a plot point, sections written in speculative future Latin - but I think most readers will not love them. You'll have to be fine with long fourth-wall violations, long passages in macaronic Latin, hallucinated philosophers reacting to C25th scenes by expositing their extrapolated view of the 25th Century, allusions that yell 'REMEMBER ME??' in your face (Hobbestown, the anarchist commune). I found the narrator's madness engaging but it does divert every chapter a bit. 

(Meme: “in the grim darkness of the C25th, mankind has divided into its elemental archetypes: <a href="{{h}}">jock</a>, <a href="{{ma}}">fash</a>, <a href="{{c}}">hufflepuff</a>, <a href="{{b}}">freud</a>, <a href="{{u}}">stemlord</a>, <a href="{{m}}">landlord</a>, <a href="{{black}}">libertarian</a>, <a href="{{euro}}">person with a country of origin instead of a personality</a>, and <a href="{{meh}}">'meh'</a>”. This is no critique of Palmer when we remember that all such groupings will arise through partially random historical contingencies: the resulting categories don’t need to make sense and probably won’t.)

The books depict superpowers, _even if we ignore the 2 or 3 supernatural beings_. The Mardis, the Censors, and the set-sets have ridiculous amounts of predictive power using Weird Data Science, predicting the timing of world events 20 or 30 years out. The Brillists have this power, plus mind reading, and bizarro mind control, and arbitrary hacking power. These are _so_ much more powerful than the tame AIs and giant mechas of the Utopians. But the plot is unchanged by them until the last book, at which point they are easily

"Worldbuilding" is often a red flag. It predicts an author who cares more about their lore than their characters or plot, who is going to fail to make you care that the legal system or the conlang or the magic system is consistent. Palmer is the queen of worldbuilding, and yet she gets over it, her characters somehow nevertheless rule the series. It is quite obvious that large amounts of her world notes did not make it into the 2000 pages of this series.

  <i>I could see you, across the sky, the crowded sea, a thousand black and winged shapes for every tardy, well-meant [dove]. But humans began digging a canal across the Gulf of Corinth more than three thousand years ago and finished it in 1893. It’s worth trying things again. Apollo Guardian of Strangers knows that it’s worth trying things again. Especially for [peace].</i>

# Book 1: _Too Like the Lightning_

I choked a little at the constant coincidences, and at the enslaved protagonist meeting literally every elite in the world in the space of two days. ("Providence" innit.)

# Book 2: _Seven Surrenders_

The sunny, war-free Hive system gets subverted multiple times. The Cousin democracy is fake. The Masons get exposed. But every Hive is governed at the whim of Madame and her captive orgy. Missed the first time: The Madame conspiracy are as bad as you'd expect, silently squeezing the pluralism and democracy out of the world
