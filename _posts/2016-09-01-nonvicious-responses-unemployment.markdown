summary:	Some vicious and potentially nonvicious responses to technological unemployment.
confidence: 90% that the ones I call vicious would be. 60% that the ones I call nonvicious would be. Only about 40% that this scenario will come to pass in the first place.
warnings: 	totalitarianism, denial of basic goods, obsolescence. Not actually worth working on.

Autonomous trucks are now in use and are already <a href="{{truckSafety}}">safer</a> and <a href="{{truckEfficient}}">more fuel-efficient</a> than human driven ones. <a href="{{usDrivers}}">Truck drivers</a> are <a href="{{usDrivers2}}">2%</a> of the entire <a href="{{usDrivers3}}">American workforce</a>.

<a href="{{journo}}">Crap journalism</a> (that is, 80% of journalism) is now fully automatable. <a href="{{art}}">Automatic art</a> is <a href="{{art2}}">quite good</a> and improving fast. Consider also <a href="{{bar}}">the cocktail bartender</a>.  And so on: <a href="{{martin}}">around half of <i>all</i> jobs</a> are at risk of being automated, assuming the rate of AI progress just stays constant ("over an unspecified period, perhaps a decade or two").

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Types of automation</h3>
	<div>

	</div>
</div><br>

Automation has been happening for hundreds of years, but in the past it probably didn't produce long-term or "technological unemployment". This is probably because people were easily able to think up new professions given new tech and culture, and since the increased productivity translated into lower costs for the automated good, which stimulated other parts of the economy, and people could retrain for the subsequent new jobs. The present wave might be different: it might actually reduce the number of available jobs permanently, because the machines now entering the workforce can be applied to <a href="{{bbc}}">many of the jobs</a> that people could retrain to do.<br><br>

If so, our economy - resource allocation based on employment (which we use as a poor proxy variable for productivity) - is a local maximum and we cannot expect to arrive at a good outcome without activism, since:<br>

<br>

<ol>
	<li>The new machine-learning automation could fully replace around half of jobs.</li>
	<li>Since these jobs involve even our highest cognitive faculties, it is possible that we won't think up new productive jobs for the replaced workers, like we did in the past.</li>
	<li>So automation could produce an unprecedentedly high unemployment rate, ~60%.</li><br>
	<li>Most existing unemployment welfare systems are inadequate and degrading.</li>
	<li>So without intervention, a crash in human welfare is easily possible.</li>
</ol>

<br>

<i>But</i>, unless we automate a lot more, we the species will never have enough wealth to offer a decent basic income, and everyone will continue to waste half their lives at work. Like C20th peasants.
<br><br>

<div class="accordion">

	<h3>How much is there for everyone?</h3>
	<div>
	{%	include nonvicious/each.html		%}
	</div>
</div>
<br>

Automation is maybe the main way that technology improves most people's lives: aside from foolish <a href="{{posit}}">status</a> exceptions like Apple products, big reductions in manufacturing cost usually mean big reduction in the end cost of goods. Obviously, replacing labour costs with lower-marginal-cost machines benefits rich machine-owners <i>most</i>, but automation also allows giant price cuts in all kinds of things; over the last two centuries these cuts have transformed society, increasing equality enormously by making things affordable for the first time.<br><br>

Besides the obvious example - that we now produce a volume of food far beyond the needs of the entire world population (<a href="{{food}}">2940kcal per person per day</a>, though with terrible distributive failures) - consider that a single ordinary shirt takes <a href="{{labour}}">508 hours of labour</a> to produce on a spinning wheel and hand-loom - so you would expect to pay something above <a href="{{wolfram}}">$3600</a> at current minimum wage (still $900 at 1400CE wage levels). <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a> Getting costs as near to zero as possible is the way we will solve the easy problem of human existence, scarcity of basic goods and leisure. <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a><br><br>

I am not very sure of any of the above; the <a href="{{loGrowth}}">actual stats on productivity growth</a> are worrying for the opposite reason: it has been too slow to support wages for a long time. Anyway other powerful forces (e.g. global outsourcing, the decay of unions) besides robots have led to the <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19136">40-year decline</a> in labour's share of global income. But those will produce similar dystopian problems if the trend continues, and there's enough of a risk of the above scenario for us to put a lot of thought and effort into protecting people, either way.<br><br>
