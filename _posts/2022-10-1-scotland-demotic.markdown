Grant me that the current uses of Scots language are less broad than others.

Why?

The demotic is _what is left_ after English took the other <a href="{{reg}}">registers</a>.

Trade
Religion
Law
Government statements
Art & Scholarship

> Full many ane tyme the archier slakkis is bow
That afterhend it may the stronger be;
Full many ane time in Vulkane's burning stow
The smith does water cast with careful ee;
Full oft contentions great arise, we see,
Betwixt the husband and his loving wife,
That sine they may the fermlyer agree
When ended is that sudden choler strife.

- James I & VI


There is obviously still Scots poetry, and much of. My claim is that all of it sounds saltier and less classy than it would be.
