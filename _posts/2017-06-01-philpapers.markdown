    Lean toward: one box
    Other (47.4%)

Omega appears before you with two boxes and says you may take Box A or take both Box A and Box B. Omega has almost certain predictive power and does not lie. Omega has predicted which you will choose; if Omega predicts you will take just Box A, then Box A will contain $1,000,000. Box B always contains $1,000. How many boxes do you take?

Teletransporter (new matter): survival or death?

    Accept: survival (36.2%)
    Lean toward: survival
    Accept: death (31.1%)
    Lean toward: death
    Other (32.7%)

You are placed in a machine that will instantaneously disintegrate your body, in the process recording its exact atomic configuration. This information is then beamed to another machine far away, and in that machine new matter is used to construct a body with the same configuration as yours. Would you consider yourself to have survived the process, and teleported from one machine to the other ("survival")? Or do you think you have died, and the duplicate in the far away machine is a different person ("death")?

Trolley problem (five straight ahead, one on side track, turn requires switching): switch or do't switch?

    Accept: switch (68.2%)
    Lean toward: switch
    Accept: don't switch (7.6%)
    Lean toward: don't switch
    Other (24.2%)

There is a trolley traveling along a set of tracks. The driver has lost control of the trolley. On the track ahead of the trolley are five people who cannot get off the track in time and will all die if the trolley gets to them. You are standing next to a lever that can switch the track the trolley will take, preventing the deaths of the five people. On the other track is a single person who also cannot get away in time and so will die if you switch the track. Do you refrain from switching the track or do you switch the track?


Truth: correspondence, deflationary, or epistemic?

    Accept: deflationary (24.8%)
    Lean toward: deflationary
    Accept: epistemic (6.9%)
    Lean toward: epistemic
    Other (17.5%)

Correspondence: A proposition is true if and only if it bears some sort of congruence relation to a state of affairs that obtains.
Deflationary: Ascribing truth to a proposition amounts to no more than asserting the proposition.
Epistemic: To say that a proposition is true is just to say that it meets a high standard of epistemic warrant, and that we are thereby justified in asserting it.


Zombies: inconceivable, conceivable but not metaphysically possible, or metaphysically possible?

    Accept: metaphysically possible (23.3%)
    Lean toward: metaphysically possible
    Other (25.1%)

A zombie is physically identical to a human being but does not possess phenomenal experience. There is nothing it is like to be a zombie.

Inconceivable: We cannot fully conceive of a zombie.
Conceivable but not metaphysically possible: One can arrive at a coherent conception of zombies, but objects that match this conception cannot possibly exist, not even in worlds with different laws of nature than ours.
Metaphysically possible: The existence of zombies is possible.
