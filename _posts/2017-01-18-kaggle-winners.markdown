Kaggle-winning Algorithms, 2010-2016

             CompetitionId,  
             Competition segment,
             End date (Deadline),
             # Rows,
             # Cols,
        EvaluationAlgorithm
            Structured,
           Winning team size,         
           Winning team # submissions,
           Models used,
           Ensemble? 


These fields are taken directly from Meta Kaggle fields; bold are new, fields that Iâ€™ve collected myself.

how structured is this data?

If you had time, you could expand this analysis to the top 3 teams (who are required publish their scripts). If you had a lot of time, you could crawl the Kaggle forums and the wider web for entrants who post their scripts elsewhere (dozens per competition).

 

 CTF.
