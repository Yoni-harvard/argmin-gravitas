Social science is _hard_. Most social phenomena involve [thousands][Causa] [of subtle effects][Manzi], of several [different][Proph] [ontological sorts][Reason], all acting on relevant populations up to about [a billion units][Nation] in size - and even if you were ever able to cement any results about it, and publicise them, a portion of your subjects would immediately [change in response][Reflex] - to spite you.

But it's important and noble to try, anyway, to understand human things using our best toolkit.

        An anthropologist friend has pointed out to me that American anthropology remains fairly scientific; most of the other geographical blocs diverged firmly into <a href="{{French}}">theory</a> in the late 60s. This makes the AAA's 2010 statement a coup as well as a calumny - given all the physical and linguistic anthropologists who work in their jurisdiction.<br>&nbsp;
    </li><br>
    <li class="footnote" id="fn:2">
        Sigh, <a href="{{Dcosta}}">but not always</a>.
    </li><br>
    <li class="footnote" id="fn:3">
        Unless you conceive of objective truths as "cognitive imperialism", like <a href="{{Batshitste}}">Marie Battiste</a>: 
        <blockquote><i>Cognitive imperialism is a form of cognitive manipulation used to disclaim other knowledge bases and values. Validated through oneâ€™s knowledge base and empowered through public education, it has been the means by which whole groups of people have been denied existence and have had their wealth confiscated. Cognitive imperialism denies people their language and cultural integrity by maintaining the legitimacy of only one language, one culture, and one frame of reference...</i></blockquote>
        Perhaps objective truth <i>is</i> imperialist in some sense - but it wasn't scientists that made the truth imperial (not the mere humans who are just trying to get you to step outside your skull and <i>look</i> for a minute). Instead, it's the world. <br><br>
        For one thing, the idea that a politicised and relativised epistemology will help the oppressed is straightforwardly false. <a href="{{Desapar}}">Dictators</a> and <a href="{{Bush}}">imperialists</a> of all stripes are perfectly happy with the idea that there's no objective truth to their crimes:<br>
        <blockquote><i>The [Bush] aide said that guys like me were "in what we call the reality-based community," which he defined as people who "believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality." I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. "That's not the way the world really works anymore," he continued. "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors ... and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."</i></blockquote>

        This noble quote is from <a href="{{Sahlins}}">Marshall Sahlins</a>, in the course of a book review where he <i>studiedly</i> fails to condemn a book known to be a scurrilous conspiracy theory, perhaps because the subject of the conspiracy theory is <a href="{{Chagnon}}">a colleague</a> whose methods he dislikes.

    <li class="footnote" id="fn:5">
        I know that neither Diamond nor Pinker are self-described or institutionally 'anthropologists'. But they have written some of the most interesting Grand Anthropology work I have ever read, and they are indeed demonic figures in undergraduate anthropology courses.

        Sigh, but yes he was <a href="{{Influx}}">in practice very xenophobic</a>.

        Who was, admittedly, not known as a beacon of tolerance even towards peoples as nearby as fellow Brits:
        <br>
        <blockquote>The author of these memoirs will remember, that Johnson one day asked him, 'Have you observed the difference between your own country impudence and Scottish impudence?' The answer being in the negative: 'Then I will tell you,' said Johnson. 'The impudence of an Irishman is the impudence of a fly, that buzzes about you, and you put it away, but it returns again, and flutters and teazes you. The impudence of a Scotsman is the impudence of a leech, that fixes and sucks your blood.'
