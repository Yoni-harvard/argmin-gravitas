> [In 1690] there were no standard "fixed points", namely phenomena that could be used as thermometric benchmarks because they were known to take place always at the same temperature. Without credible fixed points it was impossible to create any meaningful temperature scale, and without shared fixed points used by all makers of thermometers, there was little hope of making a standardized scale.

> Anything can be measured. If a thing can be observed in any way at all, it lends itself to some type of measurement method. No matter how “fuzzy” the measurement is, it’s still a measurement if it tells you more than you knew before. And those very things most likely to be seen as immeasurable are, virtually always, solved by relatively simple measurement methods.

For a very long time, we could only look, only feel. You checked claims against your own <a href="{{fore}}">forearm</a>, your own foot, a scrap of <a href="{{gr}}">crop</a>, or you paid a <a href="{{bem}}">rare savant</a> to count for you.

<!-- You can divide human history into measurement eras

* The sensation era https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalithic_Yard
* The first standard era
* The precision standard era -->

<!-- Instruments are brilliant, but we had thermometers before temperature scales. -->
<!-- Scales vs units vs instrumentation -->


https://www.gleech.org/metrics

How can you do more than this? You need a way to compare two things in terms of something other than a person. A fixed point, a reference object is handy, so you can resolve disputes and check your instrument. Eventually if you're smart you get a unit; if you're extremely smart you get <a href="{{si}}">a whole system</a> of convertible units, tying almost the whole world together.

These moments, these initial quantifications, are an incredible thing: the initiation of a new domain into science; the ability to use the world around us to track and change what's inside us. Here are my favourite occasions on which a subjective, ineffable thing was suddenly partially outside of us, less contestable.

My favourites are when we leap: from the angle of a stick in the sun to the size of the whole planet; from some crappy artefacts in your data to the <a href="{{spec}}">very composition of the sun</a>. (I guess Eratosthenes' doesn't count, since length and geometry were already admitted to be objective, just unknown.)


There are degrees of quantification: from subjective qualitative, to objective but ordinal, to objective and numeric, to <a href="{{prec}}">precise</a> and numeric. I'm mostly talking about the first shift: from essentially subjective to suddenly not, or anyway less. I also ignore whether something is objective or merely universally intersubjective.

## Small Physics

* Joule
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)
* rads


## Big physics

* Erastosthenes and the circumference.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_units
* Temperature. Fahrenheit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_temperature_and_pressure_measurement_technology
* Beaufort wind force scale
* Richter. log
* decibel. log
* megaton 
* Mohs. Ratio, not interval.


## Really big physics

Length was one of our first conquests: the <a href="{{akkad}}">Akkadians</a> had a reference length. AU, light-year, parsec are basically just logical consequences of that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime#Spacetime_interval
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoving_and_proper_distances


## Time 

* Sidereal time. Beyond solar position.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#History
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_calendars
* Geological time
* Tree ring width


## Information

* The bit. Maybe the most profound of all, since it not only transformed our society but also turned out to be a fundamental concept in the best physics we have. (NB: To an usual degree, the technical meaning of information and the ordinary meaning are very divergent. Maybe we'll reunite them one day.)


<!-- ## Ageing - biological clocks? telomere lengths? -->


## Uncertainty

We can guess the distribution of almost anything. (The ideas involved are so simple it makes you wonder why we waited til the Manhattan Project to have them, but many ideas seem that way after a <a href="{{mars}}">Martian</a> has had them for you.)

* Resampling
* Monte Carlo (MC) simulation


## Life

* Urea. Stoichiometry
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_and_recapture
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ecological_techniques

## Idea quality

* factor analysis, path analysis, multidimensional scaling
* Inter-rater reliability
* Reliability. (The famous one, Cronbach's alpha, is <a href="{{cron}}">notably rigid</a> and biased downward.)
* Loss function. A model (a hypothesis) is better if it has a lower loss on new data.

## Psychophysics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Psychophysics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-noticeable_difference . e.g. the Scoville scale

In the method of just-noticeable differences, the experimenter made small variations in the physical intensity of a stimulus, and determined when the subject detected the stimulus, or noticed that it had changed;
In the method of constant stimuli, the experimenter presented two stimuli that differed slightly in magnitude, and determined when the subject detected a difference between them;
In the method of adjustment, the subject -- not the experimenter -- varied the magnitude of the stimulus, and indicated when it (or a change) became detectable.

	<h3>Bad measures</h3>
	<div>
		That's the happy bit.<br><br>
		Many, maybe most measures fail to approximate their target.<br><br>
		All measures become bad measures if someone has an incentive to fool them.
		Anyone who works in an organisation will have encountered some bad measures, often ones which actively hinder progress.
		* SLOC
		* Subjective wine quality. Sulphites are disparaged.

	<h3>Future measures</h3>

		* <a href="{{pain}}">Real pain scales</a><br>
		* <a href="{{quale}}">All qualia</a>.<br>
		* The (cardinal) util.
	</div>
	<h3>Against measurement</h3>
	<div>
		* <a href="{{rain}}">Some romantics</a> view quantification (and explanation more generally) as degrading. The above march of including more and more in the measurable would be a tragedy on this view. What can you do for such people? You could point them at the <a href="{{universe}}">incredible beauty</a> and unmatched understanding that it enables; this seems to work, since they are rarer than they were. Science fans are the new romantics.
		<!--  -->
		* "Lies, damned lies, and statistics": it is easy to make up numbers. But it is even easier to lie without statistics, since what can you check then? What replaces the open data, the open code? Much harder to check that someone's vague subjective judgment was honest or accurate.
