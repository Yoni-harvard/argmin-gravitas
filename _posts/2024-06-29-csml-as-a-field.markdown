>  Mind seems able to impress some of its highest attributes upon matter, and to create its own rival in the wheels and levers of an insensible machine.

― William Jevons (1869)



A decent chunk of my thesis is about looking at the whole field at once.

- ML is a mongrel field. (And AI is a mongrel of mongrels). I love mongrels.
- [[what does ML consist of?]]
- [[AI Spring, 2019 - 2023]]
- [[favourite ML people]] - epistemic superiors

### Computer scientists
- I usually don't identify as things. But I am proud of computer scientists. I hope to be one someday. They marry the best of philosophy and the best of engineering.
- Many CS grads you will meet will be awful, because in the last two decades it became the default choice for heartless preprofessionals. But this doesn't reflect on the real CS people or the subject
- [[favourite computer scientists]]




> deep learning research success is largely about luck. The hypothesis space is very large and predicting what will work is very hard. (If someone can systematically check more things they’ll do better, but I think the field might be efficient at that).This leads to my extra secret hot corollary: visionary deep learning people probably don’t have more insight than the average (or even *bad*) deep learning people.
