		One of the odder rabbit holes I ever went down:<br><br>
		I was so contrarian as a young man that I spent an entire month reading writers I myself viewed as sloppy and irrational, just because I was (implicitly) told not to pay them any attention by my philosophy teachers. Despite appearances, this came from an <i>excess</i> of scepticism: scepticism about the canon, about methodology, about academia.

		Can it be that so many men, of various times and nations, outstanding minds among them, have devoted so much effort, and indeed fervor, to metaphysics, when this consists of nothing more than words strung together without sense?

	<blockquote>
		I think now that the right thing to do would be to begin my book with remarks about metaphysics as a kind of magic. But in doing this I must neither speak in defence of magic nor ridicule it. In this context, in fact, excluding magic has the character of magic.
	</blockquote>
	– Ludwig Wittgenstein, <i>PI</i> manuscript
	<br /><br />
	<blockquote>
		[Mysticism is] a philosophical urge gone wrong. Thousands of lesser philosophers are always with us to prove that it can go more wrong still, by trying to form systems out of no knowledge at all... The occult and mystical are perennial short cuts to a supervening vision... it is quite possible for the subtle visionary and the shouting dunce to inhabit the same skull... the essential truth about people prone to catch-all theories is that they aren’t in search of the truth, they’re in search of themselves.
	</blockquote>

People don't read philosophy. What do the pathologically open-minded people of the world read instead?

Bookshops tend to have only one shelf of philosophy, if that - and eight of something they call "_Mind, Body and Spirit_": books trafficking in sentimental, pseudo-philosophical, <a href="http://nymag.com/health/self-help/2013/schulz-self-searching/">pseudo-psychological</a> superstition-porn. One step removed from Scientology. 


## Why care?

The most popular philosophers in the world do not receive any professional attention: they're beneath notice. I call them the philosophical underworld. I refuse to dismiss them all just to fit in. Further: never mind __true__; __these ideas are loved__. They are the livelihood of four generations of global subculture. No matter how ill-founded, ill-grounded or even actively destructive, this gives studying them value.

We say there's "hard" subjects and "soft" subjects, with ductility proportional to mathematical rigour. Is there such a thing as "hard" mysticism?

<!-- The rationalist mob have rightly stuck the boot in to soft spirituality - and retconning religious incentives like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Templeton_Prize">Templeton Prize</a> in particular. (In case you don't know, that's the largest money-pot in intellectual life, awarded to "someone prepared to say nice things about religion"). But philosophical bullies have also attacked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Aspects_of_Life">contemporary work</a> by Paul Davies and Derek Abbott which began to develop a non-realist quantum theory. Richard Dawkins' underlying premise is that there's no room for non-scientistic thought, and this is far from obvious.<br />
<br />

Famously, mysticism came back in the 60s. It recurred for a number of reasons - a plausible sketch being that postwar disillusionment with the Western script of disenchanting materialism, led to consequent bad readings of Buddhism and Hinduism, the challenge of authority in art, romance, and war, fear of Cold War realities, sex freedom. But a minor reason is because the emergent Analytic philosophy, through its boring technical topics and formalism, withdrew from the public sphere. Rightly or wrongly, philosophy is considered the source of existential insights, and when it fails to supply it, less rational forces will supply.

There does not have to be intellectual dishonesty in holding that _there is more to this than this_. We've gotten used to branding this kind of thing 'mysticism'. So be it; but cut away the liars, Messiahs, irrationals and fanatics, leave in some of the schizophrenics, and you are left with the philosophical mystics.

Spinoza is the paradigm hard mystic. (This adds to the exemplar function he already serves for the groups "mechanical philosophers", "early liberals", "deductive rationalists" and "inspiring heretics".)

<!-- Hard mysticism ghosts the canon all the way back, under a long series of movements with self-important names: "Theosophy", "Geisteswissengeschaft", "philosophies of freedom", "process theory", "Noetic science", "Analytical Thomism", "humanistic psychology". There's an eruption of it amongst the early quantum scientists. Mathematicians have always been prone to it.<br />

Contemporary soft-mystic Movements include "New Thought", "Human Potential", most of the "Integral theory" stuff, "Transpersonal psychology", and "Neuro-linguistic programming". "Noetics" is a concept being dragged this way by Dan Brown types. Contested: "Gestalt psychology", "Reichian psychoanalysis" etc. -->


<!-- In most departments outside Literature, postmodernists are <a href="http://afterallitcouldbeworse.blogspot.com/2010/09/theory-sophistry-bullshit-style.html">similarly derided</a> (and by the same people), but they have the solace of at least partial academic credibility. No one doubts that Foucault is a philosopher (just that he's a good one). The question is: who is to decide who are "proper" philosophers? And "People with jobs in the field" is the only game in town.  -->

It'd be a mistake to go to these people looking for The Answer. But this isn't what I go to Epicurus, Kant, or Dawkins for, either.

<!-- Since I took such a broad definition of mysticism, here's something prickly to cleanse the palette:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Notes from John Searle:_"_<span style="font-size: 100%;">Why not have a science of consciousness?" <br />
<br />

Objection #1: There is no satisfactory definition of consciousness. If it cannot be defined, the field cannot get started.
<br />
Reply: There's a distinction to be made between analytical_ and common-sense_ definitions. Analytic definitions are conclusions so, no, we don't have one yet. But we can easily formulate a common-sense definition of consciousness at the outset.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Objection #2: Consciousness is subjective, and thus outside objective science's remit. 
<br />

Reply: This is a category error: the epistemic_ sense of the objective-subjective distinction is not the ontological_ sense. Consciousness is an ontologically subjective thing, which doesn't prevent an epistemically objective science of it.
<br />
<br />

Objections #3: We cannot explain how physical events cause mental events. (The attempt is precluded by the gap between neuron activity and qualia).
<br />

Reply: This is the same form as objection #1: no, we can't: that would be the result of the program. We know that it happens, and it is far from clear that progress is impossible. Current scientific puzzles are like earlier problems in the history of science, such as explaining life or electro-magnetism.
<br />

<br />
Objection #4: A science of consciousness would need to separate qualia from consciousness and leave the problem of qualia to one side. (And qualitative touchy-feely stuff cannot be easily discarded just to keep the objective portion.)
<br />
Reply: Fine: there is no distinction between consciousness and qualia. Conscious states are_ qualia.
<br />
<br />
Objection #5: Consciousness doesn't affect the world. Even if we did have a science of consciousness it wouldn't matter because consciousness is epiphenomenal. 
<br />
Reply: Consciousness is no more necessarily epiphenomenal than any other high-level feature of reality.<br />
<br />
<br />

Objection #6. What is the evolutionary function of consciousness? It plays no obvious role and thus theorists utilising have to deny functionalism.
<br />

Reply: All human activity (eating, procreating, raising offspring) are conscious activities. If anything, the evolutionary role of consciousness is too obvious!<br />
<br />
<br />
Objection #7: A causal relation between brain and consciousness implies mind-body dualism. Consciousness science would have to be conducted with this metaphysics admitted.
<br />
<br />
Reply: This objection confuses <i>event</i> causation with bottom-up causation. Just as one cannot reach into a glass of water and pick out a molecule and say `This one is wet', so, one cannot point to a single synapse or neuron in the brain and say `This one is thinking about my grandmother'. As far as we know anything about it, thoughts about grandmothers occur at a much higher level than that of the single neuron or synapse, just as liquidity occurs at a much higher level than that of single molecules.<br />
<br />

<br />

Objection #8: Science is by definition reductionistic. A scientific account of consciousness must reduce it to something else.
<br />

Reply: So? We need to here distinguish explanatory_ reductions from eliminative_ reductions. One cannot eliminate by reduction anything that really exists; and we begin with the hypothesis that consciousness really exists. 
<br />
Objection: Any scientific account of consciousness must be functionalist, i.e. an account in terms of (mere) information-processing.<br />
<br />

Reply: No, and in fact, it can't be: information-processing is observer-relative. Consciousness is intrinsic, observer-independent.
