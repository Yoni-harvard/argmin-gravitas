	If a person knows he is being denied an opportunity... he can never be quite certain whether his lack of desire for it is shaped by the fact that it is unavailable to him (“sour grapes”). That gnawing uncertainty counts as a harm.

<blockquote>
	ONE hot summer’s day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine over a lofty branch. “Just the things to quench my thirst,” quoth he. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and just missed the bunch. <br /><br />Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: “I am sure they are sour.”

A research programme that would be very illuminating and very unpopular: How much is someone’s methodology to do with rationalising their particular abilities? 

Does not having the skill to conduct either quantitative or qualitative research correlate with denying its value? (Clearly yes.)

Given that people very often adjust their desires to their opportunities, and given that methodology should ride on higher things, I propose a trio of studies to check the academic community’s hygiene:

* <i>Sour symbols</i>: Disparaging or emphasising the limits of quantitative reason because you yourself are bad at maths.

* <i>Sour mouth</i>: Disparaging or emphasising the limits of qualitative reason because you yourself are bad at criticism or phenomenology.

* <i>Scoundrel bastions</i>: What fields do people with _neither_ competence flock to?
<br />

The inverted forms – seeing what you're good at as a superior insight into the world ("sweet lemons" and "<a href="{{jaynes}}">mind projection</a>") – are as important, but hopefully get captured in the first correlation.

One could use the SAT or <a href="https://www.ets.org/research/policy_research_reports/rr-87-11">GRE</a> to obtain a proxy of verbal and mathematical reasoning ability; people would object to this, 1) rightly because timed tests are an artificial measure of research ability – they can prove ability, but they can’t really disprove <i>real-life</i> ability – and 2) wrongly, because it threatened their status. 

By combining the two studies <a href="http://web.mst.edu/~psyworld/within_subjects.htm">within-subjects</a>, we could derive a <i>general factor of adaptive methodology</i>: how much a given person is swayed by their own lack of skill. This could be a proxy for how rationally they conduct themselves in general.

I respect Putnam’s and Rorty's criticisms of positivism because I know <a href="http://www.kva.se/globalassets/priser/schock/2011/pop_schock_logik_eng_2011.pdf">they are</a> profoundly skilled in logic; I trust <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/business/economist-deirdre-mccloskey-playing-both-sides-of-the-street-20131201-2ygwu.html">Deirdre McCloskey</a> much more in her postmodern libertarian feminism because she was both a quantitative historian and a socialist in her youth.

Good methodology can substitute for brilliance: if you follow the scientific method long enough, you <i>will</i> find stuff out, almost regardless of your acuity or creativity. 

An unfortunate demonstration is Thomas Midgley's discovery of tetraethyl lead: "<i>At war’s end he resumed his search for a gasoline additive, systematically working his way through promising elements in the periodic table, and in 1921 he and his team found that minute amounts of tetraethyl lead completely eliminated engine knock.</i>" Four years of dumb permutation!

If you can understand an algorithm's steps, you can perform incredibly complex mathematics given only patience and a pen. (<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/soda09.pdf">Or wings</a>.) In programming, object-oriented languages enforce a simple stepped method that allows numpties to make, well, most of the internet.

Relatedly: to have the studies produce results of lasting worth – rather than results for wreaking retribution on idle methodologists – we'd want to track the things that practitioners did. (Though is there any such thing as a practitioner, in philosophy?)



<!-- <br /><br /><blockquote>
<i>Hold on! To make sense of the world, we have math. Who needs algorithms? It is beyond dispute that the dizzying success of 20th century science is, to a large degree, the triumph of mathematics. A page's worth of math formulas is enough to explain most of the physical phenomena around us: why things fly, fall, float, gravitate, radiate, blow up, etc. As Albert Einstein said, “The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.” Granted, Einstein's assurance that something is comprehensible might not necessarily reassure everyone, but all would agree that the universe speaks in one tongue and one tongue only: mathematics.
<br><br>
But does it, really? This consensus is being challenged today. As young minds turn to the sciences of the new century with stars in their eyes, they're finding old math wanting. Biologists have by now a pretty good idea of what a cell looks like, but they've had trouble figuring out the magical equations that will explain what it does. How the brain works is a mystery (or sometimes, as in the case of our 43rd president, an overstatement) whose long, dark veil mathematics has failed to lift.
<br><br>
Economists are a refreshingly humble lot—quite a surprise really, considering how little they have to be humble about. Their unfailing predictions are rooted in the holy verities of higher math. True to form, they'll sheepishly admit that this sacred bond comes with the requisite assumption that economic agents, also known as humans, are benighted, robotic dodos—something which unfortunately is not always true, even among economists.
<br><br>
A consensus is emerging that, this time around, throwing more differential equations at the problems won't cut it. Mathematics shines in domains replete with symmetry, regularity, periodicity—things often missing in the life and social sciences. Contrast a crystal structure (grist for algebra's mill) with the World Wide Web (cannon fodder for algorithms). No math formula will ever model whole biological organisms, economies, ecologies, or large, live networks. Will the Algorithm come to the rescue? This is the next great hope. The algorithmic lens on science is full of promise—and pitfalls.
<br><br>
First, the promise. If you squint hard enough, a network of autonomous agents interacting together will begin to look like a giant distributed algorithm in action. Proteins respond to local stimuli to keep your heart pumping, your lungs breathing, and your eyes glued to this essay—how more algorithmic can anything get? The concomitance of local actions and reactions yielding large-scale effects is a characteristic trait of an algorithm. It would be naive to expect mere formulas like those governing the cycles of the moon to explain the cycles of the cell or of the stock market.
<br><br>
Contrarians will voice the objection that an algorithm is just a math formula in disguise, so what's the big hoopla about? The answer is: yes, so what? The issue here is not logical equivalence but expressibility. Technically, number theory is just a branch of set theory, but no one thinks like that because it's not helpful. Similarly, the algorithmic paradigm is not about what but how to think. The issue of expressiveness is subtle but crucial: it leads to the key notion of </i>abstraction<i> and is worth a few words here (and a few books elsewhere).<br></blockquote></i><br /><div align="center">

My saying 'methodology' in the above makes the point seem irrelevant to anyone but academics or devoted autodidacts. (The word only really denotes the formal and contrived ways that we act when we know we'll have to face scrutiny.) But the implications go way beyond those islands in the sun to the grody places in which most thought lives.

<ul>
	<li>Computer science: the methodology is necessarily quantitative. </li>
	<li>Philosophy: methodology largely qualitative (though with a distinct subculture of utter quants / <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege/#AnaStaNum">meta-quants</a>). Everyone's a methodologist.</li>
</ul><br />
