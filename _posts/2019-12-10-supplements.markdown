In the last century, half a revolution happened: you can now buy <a href="{{thousands}}">many thousands of substances</a> that claim to promote health, and some of them do. The promise is of fine control over health: the prevention of idiosyncratic disorders, and/or aiming at the huge and murky area of "subclinical" human health problems, all the minor things that make life worse. 

And so <a href="{{uk}}">most UK adults</a> take supplements (about half of those multivitamins). Several problems with this:

1. _Absence of general evidence / Evidence of harm_. Many supposedly health-promoting substances have uselessly weak evidence. For instance, <a href="{{multi}}">frequent use of multivitamins</a> is probably somewhat harmful,: they _increase_ mortality for the average user, due to overdosing you with antioxidants. <br>

2. _Physiology is personal_. Even for substances that have general warrant, the inter-person variation in their effects and side-effects can be enormous. (For instance, <a href="{{caff}}">some people</a> don't get _any_ stimulation from caffeine for genetic reasons.) <br>

3. _Geographical and seasonal variation_: for instance, during winter, around <a href="{{d}}">a third</a> of UK adults are deficient in vitamin D.<br>

4. _Snake oil on the margin_: The supplement industry is regulated (for instance, you have to apply to the <a href="{{ec}}">European Commission</a> if you want to make a health claim for your product), but <a href="{{claims}}">misleading claims</a> and <a href="{{dilute}}">inaccurate concentrations</a> are common. (For instance, the Ayurvedic supplement <a href="{{baco}}">bacopa</a> has been known to contain unsafe levels of lead and other heavy metals.)<br>

5. Powdered supplements are often 2-4x cheaper than pills, but are fiddly and sometimes taste bad. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a><br>

6. _What counts is latent_: There are now cheap places to get blood tests (or genome hits) for particular biomarkers, which you'd think would close the gap. But blood markers are only proxies for the _real_ target variables: mortality, productivity, mood, etc.

<br>
The missing half of the revolution is measurement. The sensible supplementer needs three kinds of data to avoid waste and unnecessary risk: 

* general clinical findings, 
* personal experiments (biochemistry before and after, control doses, measurements of actually valuable responses), 
* chemical assays of particular products. 

A shame that <a href="{{ioan}}">general</a> <a href="{{ioan2}}">clinical</a> <a href="{{ebm}}">findings</a> are so <a href="{{ioan3}}">unreliable</a>, and that getting strong personal data remains the province of <a href="{{selves}}">heroically nerdy people</a>, willing to invest dozens of hours into <a href="{{sarek}}">self-experimentation</a> (reading papers, double-blinding with self-filled capsules, data collection), including learning <a href="{{g}}">how to analyse the results</a> sensibly. There's something sad about this: that external validity is so hard in biomed (and society...) that all we can really trust is local inference, n-of-1 description.

Despite plummeting measurement costs (blood tests down by 100x, genome down by 100,000x, all the consumer gizmos), the money and time required for an actually-scientific supplement habit are still prohibitive. So you take safe inexpensive things and live with the uncertainty - or, more, you rely on <a href="{{algernon}}">a prior</a> that evolution is hard to beat on body matters, and lean against taking anything except the most convincing. 

There are economies of scale to operationalising research, testing batches and filling capsules. So is this a gap in the market? I don't really know, I just know I want it to exist. (There are already well-funded <a href="{{vitl}}">toy versions</a> of a personalised service, but their offering is pretty superficial so far.)
