<a href="{{uk}}">Most UK adults</a> take supplements (about half of those take a multivitamin). Several problems with this, some of them common to all biomedical questions:

1. _Absence of evidence / Evidence of harm_. Many supposedly health-promoting substances (“nutraceuticals”) have no evidence suggesting they work. For instance, <a href="{{multi}}">frequent use of multivitamins</a> is probably somewhat harmful, _increasing_ mortality for the average user, due to overdosing antioxidants. 
2. _Physiology is personal_. Even for substances that have general warrant, the inter-person variation in their effects and side-effects is enormous. (For instance, <a href="{{caff}}">some people</a> don't experience caffeine as a stimulant for genetic reasons.) 
3. There’s also geographical and seasonal variation: for instance, during winter, around <a href="{{d}}">a third</a> of UK adults are deficient in vitamin D.
4. The supplement industry is regulated (for instance, you have to apply to the <a href="{{ec}}">European Commission</a> if you want to make a health claim), but <a href="{{claims}}">misleading claims</a> and <a href="{{dilute}}">dilute concentrations</a> are common. (For instance, the Ayurvedic supplement Bacopa has been known to contain unsafe levels of lead and other heavy metals.)
5. Powdered supplements are often 2-4x cheaper than pills, but they are fiddly and sometimes taste bad.
6. Blood tests are only proxies for the real target variables: mortality, energy, mood, etc.

For instance the nutritional shakes used by the NHS are three times cheaper in <a href="{{powder}}">powder form</a>. They're also £17 each for some reason.


So we need three kinds of data: general clinical findings, personal biochemistry, and chemical assays of particular. Problem (3) implies a need for batch-wise chemical testing of certain supplements. Problem (5) also suggests gains from a consumer capsule filling service. 

(6) remains the province of heroically nerdy people, willing to invest dozens of hours into self-experimentation, and then to learn how to analyse it sensibly.
