Inspired by <a href="{{Snot}}">this</a> long list of things that separate a fresh programmer from an actual engineer. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a> The following is also very long, but aims to enlighten, not chastise.<br><br>


<div class="accordion">
	<h3>What is data science?</h3>
	<div>
		It's just statistical programming, but with an emphasis on computer methods for getting answers out of annoyingly large amounts of data for poorly understood problems. And a truckful of marketing hype.<br><br>

		It's a silly name for a few reasons: for all statisticians use science on data and have done for a hundred years, and all programming is data programming, and the actual job has much more data munging and rote scripting in it than it has experimental science.<br><br> 

		A more honest name is <i>machine learning data analyst</i>... but we have to make a living somehow. The best you can say for us is, at least we don't claim that our poky little <a href="{{logReg}}">logistic regressor</a> is <a href="{{AIAI}}">An Artificial Intelligence</a>. (...)<br><br>

		Data analysis is an art, in Knuth's sense:<br><br>

		<blockquote>
			Science is everything we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.
		</blockquote>

		but it isn't cool to call yourself a data analyst for some reason. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a><br><br>

	<h3>Statistical modelling</h3>

	<h3>Machine learning (ML)</h3>

	<h3>Data janitoring</h3>
	<div>
		Medium articles and "Learn DS in 7 minutes" pieces usually fail to mention that 80% of the work in a data science project is spent gathering and cleaning data. Which is no damn fun at all.<br><br>
