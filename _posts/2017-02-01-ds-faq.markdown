<blockquote>if praise is given to those who have determined the number of Platonic solids... how much better will it be to bring under mathematical laws human reasoning, the most excellent and useful thing we have?</blockquote>
<div align="center">- Gottfried von Leibniz</div><br><br>



Inspired by <a href="{{Snot}}">this</a> long list of things that separate a fresh programmer from an actual engineer. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a> The following is also very long, but aims to enlighten, not to chastise.<br><br>


<div class="accordion">
	<h3>What is data science?</h3>
	<div>
		It's a trendy way of saying statistical programming, with emphasis on newer methods for getting answers out of annoyingly large piles of data, to solve poorly understood problems. "The art of growing programs with data; the education of machines; the mathematical construction of data analysts". Needless to say, it benefits from a truckful of marketing hype (for instance the preceding sentence).<br><br>
	
		<div class="accordion">
			{%	include dsfaq/prozess.html	%}
		</div><br>
		A more honest name is <i>analytics developer</i>... but hey we all got to make a living. (The best you can say for us is, at least we don't claim that our poky little <a href="{{logReg}}">logistic regressor</a> is <a href="{{AIAI}}">An Artificial Intelligence</a>. (...))<br><br>

		Data analysis is an <i>art</i>, in <a href="{{Knuth}}">Knuth's sense</a>:<br><br>
		<blockquote>
			Science is everything we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.
		</blockquote>
		and thus so is data science. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> But it isn't cool to call yourself a data analyst, for some reason. <br><br><br>

	<h3>Statistical modelling</h3>
	<div>
		<div class="accordion">
			{%	include dsfaq/modelling.html	%}
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3>Machine learning (ML)</h3>
	<div>
		<div class="accordion">
			{%	include dsfaq/ml.html	%}
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3>Programming</h3>
	<div>
		<div class="accordion">
			{%	include dsfaq/code.html	%}
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3>Data janitoring</h3>
	<div>
		<i>Medium</i> pieces on "How to Learn Data Science in 19 seconds" usually fail to mention that 80% of the work is gathering and cleaning data, one column at a time. Which is no damn fun at all for obvious reasons.<br><br>

		<div class="accordion">
			{%	include dsfaq/janitor.html	%}
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3>Distributed computing</h3>
	<div>
		<div class="accordion">
			{%	include dsfaq/cluster.html	%}
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3>Recommended reading</h3>
	<div>
		<div class="accordion">
			{%	include dsfaq/books.html	%}
		</div>
		<br><a href="{{spoilers}}">Full list here</a>. All books: I don't care for MOOCs or Youtube series. You can ignore all <i>Medium</i> posts on the matter (or any matter), with the exception of <a href="{{Kelleh}}">@akelleh</a>, which you must read.
	</div>

	<h3>Glossary</h3>
	<div>
		{%	include dsfaq/gloss.html	%}
	</div>	
	
</div>

<br><br>
<blockquote>All human activities can be described by five components: data, prediction, judgment, action, and outcomes. A visit to the doctor leads to: <b>1)</b> x-rays, blood tests, monitoring (data), <b>2)</b> diagnosis: “if we administer treatment A, then we predict outcome X, but if we administer treatment B, then we predict outcome Y” (prediction), <b>3)</b> “given your age, lifestyle, and family status, I think you might be best with treatment A...” (judgment); <b>4)</b> administering treatment A (action), and <b>5)</b> full recovery with minor side effects (outcome).<br><br>

As machine intelligence improves, the value of human prediction skills will decrease because machine prediction will provide a cheaper and better substitute, just as machines did for arithmetic...</blockquote>
