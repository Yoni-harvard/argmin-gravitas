> Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease... The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.

> Hunter-gatherers emerged from the "Man the Hunter" conference in 1966 as the "original affluent society." The main features of this thesis now seem to be widely accepted by anthropologists, despite the strong reservations expressed by certain specialists in foraging societies concerning the data advanced to support the claim.

* Weak original affluence: Less working hours than us.
* Strong original affluence: More welfare than us.

The 'original affluence' hypothesis is a smeary mix of 4 claims:

1. Ancient hunter-gatherers worked fewer hours than agrarians.
2. Ancient hunter-gatherers worked fewer hours than contemporary industrial people.
3. Ancient hunter-gatherers had greater welfare than agrarians.
4. Ancient hunter-gatherers had greater welfare than contemporary industrial people.

Claims (1) and (3) are plausible. (4) is hard to test (though I will note in passing the incredibly short lives of  hunter-gatherers - 54% of people dying before 15, and 80% before 40).
<!-- only including time spent hunting and gathering while omitting time spent on collecting firewood, food preparation -->
Let's look at (2), because we have some hope of addressing that limited point.

## How long did hunter-gatherers work?


### 
https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours#all-charts-preview

"the simplicity of their lives stemmed from a zen philosophy that, because they wanted little, they effectively had all they needed."

"foraging model that combined deep environmental confidence, a lack of materialism, low population density, egalitarianism, lack of territoriality, minimum storage, and an easy flux in band composition"


There are two lines of evidence about our original society, pre-agrarian hunter-gatherering: archaeology ("paleopathology") and studies of contemporary hunter-gatherers (6000 years later, usually with frequent trade with agrarian and industrial society).


However, Gregory Clark, a great scholar, says they were low-hours.

Lee's numbers explicitly counted only the initial foraging of the mongongo nuts, i.e. none of the food processing, firewood gathering or tool maintenance. After adjusting for these, the average !Kung work week is at least 50 hours and probably more. See:

## How long do we work?

		Much of the world is still rising out of Victorian horror.

		I'm not doing much moral accounting in this piece, but the welfare case does depend on this being temporary, as the horrors of early British industrial life were temporary.

VS: "Nowadays, food 'collecting', food processing, DIY (taking care of tools) are not counted into working time but come extra and are taken from 'free' time. And they amount to 1, perhaps 2, working day equivalent per week."


VS VS 
Sure: "40 hours a week" for moderns is also an underestimate.* But the figure everyone goes around repeating about hunter-gatherers is a more dramatic underestimate. The accurate !Kung estimate is 48-56 hours spent on these things: so we seem to be about the same, but with massively improved quality, cost, and nutrition for us. 
The debunking applies to the claim that they had more leisure than us. Lee says: "work week... of 2.4 days per adult... [the bushmen] appeared to enjoy more leisure time than the members of many agricultural and industrial societies."


* Industrialised-world cooking time per week seems to be about 6 hours.

Difficult to find average shopping time, but call it 5-7 hours a week.

How could this be? How could people make sweeping, highly counterintuitive claims off the back of a misreading of two tiny studies? How could the mistake persist for 50 years (and counting)?

<!-- Harari

"On the whole foragers seem to have enjoyed a more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than most of the peasants, shepherds, labourers and office clerks who followed in their footsteps.

"While people in today's affiuent societies work an average of forty to forty-five hours a week, and people in the developing world work sixty and even eighty hours a week, hunter-gatherers living today in the most inhospitable of habitats -- such as the Kalahari Desert -- work on average for just thirty-five to forty-five hours a week. They hunt only one day out of three, and gathering takes up just three to six hours daily. In normal times, this is enough to feed the band. It may well be that ancient hunter-gatherers living in zones more fertile than the Kalahari spent even less time obtaining food and raw materials. On top of that, foragers enjoyed a lighter load of household chores. They had no dishes to wash, no carpets to vacuum, no floors to polish, no nappies to change and no bills to pay.

"The forager economy provided most people with more interesting lives than agriculture or industry do. Today, a Chinese factory hand leaves home around seven in the morning, makes her way through polluted streets to a sweatshop, and there operates the same machine, in the same way, day in, day out, for ten long and mind-numbing hours, returning home around seven in the evening in order to wash dishes and do the laundry. Thirty thousand years ago, a Chinese forager might leave camp with her companions at, say, eight in the morning. They'd roam the nearby forests and meadows, gathering mushrooms, digging up edible roots, catching frogs and occasionally running away from tigers. By early afternoon, they were back at the camp to make lunch. That left them plenty of time to gossip, tell stories, play with the children and just hang out. Of course the tigers sometimes caught them, or a snake bit them, but on the other hand they didn't have to deal with automobile accidents and industrial pollution. -->

	<h3>Discourse on me</h3>
	<div>
		I share Keynes' instincts - not as a theory of what other people generally want or should want, but as a description of how I relate to work and self-sufficiency.<br><br>
		<!--  -->
		I've been tested: I was once unemployed for a long 6 month stretch. Money aside, I didn't suffer: I just spent most of it in the library or cycling around Renfrewshire or lazing about with my languorous girlfriend. I read 80 books and created an <a href="/system">architectonic</a> (an ontology for fields). Keynes knows that most people can't live like this (and I know that I shouldn't - just that I can).<br><br>
