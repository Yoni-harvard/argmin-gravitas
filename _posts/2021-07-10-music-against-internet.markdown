> Could I interest you in everything all of the time?<br>
A little bit of everything all of the time?<br>
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime!<br>
Anything and everything all of the time.

> Mommy let you use her iPad; you were barely two
And it did all the things we designed it to do
Now, look at you! Oh, look at you!
You, you! Unstoppable, watchable...

Phobia by Nothing But Thieves

# public void by Penelope Scott

Remarkable. Both hyperintellectual and anti-intellectual. She has much the same revulsion towards formal microeconomics as I did.

The title is a Java joke.

"Atomistic rational behavior
Invisible hand savior
Fucking up your definitions even though it's life or death
Who fucking told you you were selfish
Or even self-interested
Don't you think it matters when we with our friends the best
And fuck I'm not a Marxist
I'm not a fucking democrat
Because of all this bullshit I'm not anything at all
All I wanted was a framework
None of them can live here
There's nothing to believe in and there won't be until we fall
And it's not all you man
You were just a kid once
God I'm such a fuck up
If you only knew that I am such a fuck up
I've got one-hundred hours to rearrange the stars
And I'm the worst mistake your God has ever made
I can't get the numbers right
I can't fucking count because not one goddamned thing is in its place"
