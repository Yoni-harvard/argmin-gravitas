> Could I interest you in everything, all of the time?<br>
A little bit of everything, all of the time?<br>
Apathy's a tragedy - and boredom is a crime!<br>
Anything and everything: all of the time.

What does music tell us about the world? Almost nothing.

What does music tell us about the prevailing view of the world? Something: for most people it's more ideologically powerful than books.


The cool music of the noughties has a clear worldview. Too clear, if anything, but then the evils seemed clear. Anti-war, anti-surveillance, atheistic, pirate parties and information wants to be free. Freedom as a bipartisan or anyway double concept. The mood is agentic: "sure our foes have the power now, but if we _do_ something, if we just have enough journalists and scientists and NGOs, we'll win." Moral clarity, even if naive, even if loud-mouthed.


<!-- _(Obviously not the average music of the noughties. I mean the cool music with _some_ actual worldview.)_ -->

<!-- I love hyperdetailed lyrics, even though they date songs. -->


What zeitgeist is embodied now? 

Malaise. The songs I cherrypicked for this post are Not Okay, or whatever. They think this is to do with the internet, or the poisoned media environment, or the poisoned <a href="{{aero}}">air</a>, or whatever. These musicians are Extremely Online outliers and cannot stand in for the young, psychoanalysis of them does not generalise, does not characterise the default ideology of the whole generation, or whatever. 


<!-- Musicians are unrepresentative, much more sensitive than others to start with and encouraged to exaggerate feeling a bit. But music also feeds into what people say they think. -->


But that said you can hear the apocalyptic apathy, the apathetic apocalypsism. (<a href="{{burnham}}">All about</a> <a href="{{nbt}}">the end</a>.) Depressive flagellants. ("_My tuition's paid by blood, I might deserve your fate or worse_.")

### _because the internet_ by Childish Gambino

</center>
<br>

> Man made the web, you don't need a name<br>
Man made of faults, I ain't too ashamed...<br>
Every thought I had, I put it in a box<br>
Everybody see it, just before the cops<br>
Andrew Auernheimer pulling on her weave, <br>
it's that Andrew Auernheimer<br>
Texts from people I never met, doors left open<br>
(Who is this? Don't do it, where are you?<br> 
Who is this? Who is this?)<br>
I don't know who I am anymore<br>

This album is nearly 10 years old, and it certainly feels different, dated (e.g. namedropping "iphone"). But CG shares the essential queasiness of the rest of this internet music: he was clearly at the vanguard of the extremely online.

The mood is ultra anxious, decadent, but unlike others he manages to convey some wonder and love of info and tech.

### _Inside_ by Bo Burnham

<br>

A covid album more than an internet album. But the covid years were the most intense internet years ever. 

He is always skilled, sometimes beautiful - but often limits himself to novelty songs. (What is a novelty? Something which works only once, regardless of the quality of that once.)

> Mommy let you use her iPad; you were barely two<br>
And it did all the things we designed it to do<br>
Now, look at you! Oh, look at you!<br>
You, you! Unstoppable, watchable...


_White Woman's Instagram_ is a few things. It sneers. It's crabbed: seeing positivity makes him want to drag it down. It hides its basic negativity behind political piety: without the 'white' qualifier to validate it, it would have caused him trouble, "joyshaming" or whatever.

But then it drops all that and shows the woman mourning her dead parents and I defy you to keep smirking.

> Her favorite photo of her mom<br>
The caption says, "I can't believe it<br>
It's been a decade since you've been gone...<br>
It's got a little better but it's still hard<br>
Mama, I got a job I love and my own apartment<br>
Mama, I got a boyfriend and I'm crazy about him<br>
Your little girl didn't do too bad<br>
Mama, I love you, give a hug and kiss to dad"

(Although I'm not actually sure that cruelty was the base level intention, rather than cruelty-baiting. _If in fact_ he was pretending to join in with our contempt - to get us to lower our guard and so feel ashamed when those dead parents make us remember that this is a [fictional? no matter] person and that taste-as-in-cynicism is a small thing - then this is greatness. But I fear not.)

What torments Burnham? Lockdown, clearly. Modern political guilt, but only somewhat. Something organic under it all.

_Problematic_ is perfectly poised between sincerity and irony (_"Or that I'd live to regret it"_). The great moment is when the second half apologises for the first half of the song, an acute look at a very common online phenom, where someone apologises and then has to apologise after the initial apology gets savaged. 

> I want to show you how I'm growing as a person, but first<br>
I feel I must address the lyrics from the previous verse<br>
I tried to hide behind my childhood and that's not okay<br>
My actions are my own, I won't explain them away<br>
I've done a lot of self-reflecting<br>
Since I started singing this song<br>
I was totally wrong when I said it<br>
Father, please forgive me for I did not realize what I did<br>
(Or that I'd live to regret it)<br>
The times are changing and I'm getting old<br>
Are you gonna hold me accountable?<br>
My bed is empty, and I'm getting cold<br>
Isn't anybody gonna hold me accountable?

But the song also distances him from his stupid, brilliant early work. Honour him for not allowing this to _utterly_ crush him, for still telling some jokes, even if they're sad and reject comedy.


> Stunning 8K-resolution meditation app<br>
In honor of the revolution, it's half-off at the Gap<br>
Deadpool, self-awareness, loving parents, harmless fun<br>
The backlash to the backlash to the thing that's just begun<br>
There it is again, that funny feeling...<br><br>
<b>Twenty-thousand years of this, seven more to go</b>...<br>
Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown<br>
A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone<br>
Total disassociation, fully out your mind<br>
Googling derealization, hating what you find<br>
That unapparent summer air in early fall<br>
The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all<br>
There it is again, that funny feeling<br>
That funny feeling<br>
Hey, what can you say? We were overdue<br>
But it'll be over soon<br>

I expect this to age much better than Childish Gambino.

(BTW the visual design of the show is more than half of the artistry, so watch rather than listen.)

# _Moral Panic_ by Nothing But Thieves 

I can't pin these guys down. 'Moral Panic' is a great title for satire - but they're too earnest and don't seem able to rise above their moment. e.g. There's a random dig at MAGAs. (They're English.) 

More like Pendulum than Mclusky. Still, one great song:

</center>
<br>

<!-- Unperson

> I'm no longer fit for public consumption
 -->

<!-- Moral Panic

> All the children are so anxious, they're on edge, so tense<br>
It's too late to begin; your excuses are wearing thin<br>
Moral panic is setting in<br>
We're standing back and we watch it go
We let it go
 -->

<!-- > I love the night but not the stars<br>
The famous outcomes in their blood-fuelled cars<br>
 -->
> I fucking hate the internet<br>
The fame suckers in their block-long cars<br>
Five star hotel (i don't feel well)<br>
I think I'll cancel the honeymoon...<br>
I could use some healing soon<br>
Before I lose all feeling soon...

> We're shutting down the internet...<br>
I got some pills but not some help<br>
make my clicks spike<br>
Why don't we hit the minima?

<!-- From all the junkies in the private health... -->
<!-- I get the rays so I live in hope... 

 -->

<!-- > Another day another night stuck in my own head/ -->

# _public void_ by Penelope Scott

<center>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlmfjU8BuhA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br>


Remarkable. Scott is both hyperintellectual and anti-intellectual, a radical with no theory and no praxis. (She has much the same revulsion towards formal microeconomics as I once did. The title is a Java joke.)

> Atomistic rational behavior / Invisible hand savior<br>
Fucking up your definitions even though it's life or death<br>
Who fucking told you you were selfish<br>
Or even self-interested<br>
Don't you think it matters when we're with our friends, the best

The obvious standout is _Raet_, an elegy of a Musk fan who woke up, a post-rationalist anthem. But _Moonsickness_ is her lyrical triumph, or whatever the opposite of triumph is: exultant despair, proud sickness.

> I've got one hundred hours to rearrange the stars<br>
And I'm the worst mistake that God has ever made<br>
You seem to integrate so fucking well<br>
But I make lemons out of lemonade...<br><br>
If you had children now you think<br>
You might just put them down<br>
None of us belong<br>
Everything I do is wrong<br><br>
And fuck I'm not a Marxist<br>
I'm not a fucking democrat<br>
Because of all this bullshit I'm not anything at all<br>
All I wanted was a framework<br>
None of them can live here<br>
There's nothing to believe in and there won't be til we fall<br>
And it's not all you man<br>
You were just a kid once<br>
God I'm such a fuck up...<br>
I've got one-hundred hours to rearrange the stars<br>
And I'm the worst mistake your God has ever made<br>
I can't get the numbers right<br>
I can't fucking count because not one goddamned thing is in its place


Elsewhere she addresses the bizarre feminine love of true crime podcasts. (Google Trend for "true crime" against US violent crime rate...)

# _Solid State_ by Jonathan Coulton

<center>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6M6z6j3mBYI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Rare entry from the prior generation, someone with a reference for what things were like before. Cancel culture exists here. But actually it's only half current malaise and half an oddly detailed picture of a post-human malaise. ("_I lit up the sea, pulled down the stars for you_")
"Sunshine" is a remarkable portrait of a Disneyland without children, sung by the final unemulated humans. Ray Kurzweil comes up in two different songs. You may take my mortality, you may take my toil, but you shall never take my misery.


> Small mistake: "a terrible crime".<br>
It's better than solid state.<br>
It's all messed up, it's better that way<br>
Everyone you know, crooked little numbers game<br>
Everywhere you go, it's all the same<br>
Watch them rise and fall<br>
Human after all (take care of other)<br>
Used to be, the world was too far away<br>
Used to be, the stars didn't have much to say


(Is the eponymous 'solid state' death? No, it's larger: it's the state of nonexistence: when your legacy, all evidence of your past and any continuing effects of your actions cease.)

> The echo of a choice, the static that you leave behind / Is better than solid state.
<br>

_Brave_ is a portrait of the keyboard warrior, mostly the incel kind (though the right has no monopoly on resentment). It's not totally devoid of empathy. 

> Slack-jawed sheeple with their eyes closed<br>
There's too many of you, more than I can save<br> 
When I torch the place, cover up my face,<br>
That will make me brave.<br>
Filling in the shapes of shadows in my cave...<br>
You speak and presto-changeo, now I'm the bad one.<br>
My heart hardening, counting up the lonely nights, <br>
all the little slights I'm taking to my grave.

<br>

_Pictures of Cats_

> All of the pieces and none of the places they go<br>
So I am looking at pictures of cats.<br>
Too close, so I'm pretending I'm far far away.<br>
Not now; I didn't want to be useless today.<br>
Try me tomorrow, today has been laying me low.

<br>

_Don't Feed The Trolls_

The best depiction of the chilling effect.

The other artists mostly ignore surveillance, one of the defining evils from before. They feel they have larger problems


> Dance like they're watching you, because they are watching you.<br>
And when the bright lights find you, don't let your heart get lazy<br>
Don't read the comments and don't feed the trolls...<br>
Appreciate the outrage, I did the best I could<br>
I thought about your thinkpiece, I don't think it's any good<br>
I just checked my privilege, and it looks fine...<br>
And when the bright lights find you, bro come on bro don't taze me<br>
Don't read the comments and don't feed the trolls.<br>
Don't read the comments and don't feed the trolls.<br>
Don't read the comments and don't feed the trolls.<br>
Don't read the comments and don't feed the trolls.

To listen to them, you'd think the internet was a curse. 

I'm reminded of the popular view of Twitter (and Reddit), as a sea of toxin which needs to be tightly controlled. Sorry to tell you that the toxin is coming from inside the house.

None succeed in capturing the internet's aesthetics and logics as well as Dril. But then nothing does.<br><br>

<div class="">
    Shockingly good writing from a business professor, <a href="{{forgues}}">Forgues</a>:
    <!--  -->
    <blockquote>
        The problem is, extreme cases are rare. Rare enough not to show up in our random samples (or at least not in sufficient numbers for us to run statistics). So we resort to laboratory experiments or simulations, which bring rigour and yield strong results, but also face constant criticisms for lack of external validity. Or we single out cases for qualitative analysis, which allows in-depth understanding, but are mostly suited to specific (often processual) research questions. There is another way to sidestep the issue of rare cases. It consists in purposely taking identified rare cases and adding other observations randomly, and is known as case-control design. The case-control design offers promising research avenues for our field. It opens the door to a better understanding of breakthrough innovation, corporate misconduct, megamergers, financial restatements, etc. Still, this boils down to sampling on the dependent variable, something we have been warned against repeatedly as graduate students. The risk is sample selection bias and false inferences...
