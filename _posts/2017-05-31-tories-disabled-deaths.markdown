You often see the claim that the Tories have killed "thousands" of disabled people by spuriously cutting them off from disability benefit. ([ESA][esa] is probably the only government program in the world with [a Palme d'Or winning film][blake] about how shit it is.)

This number seems to come from a [naive reading][naive] of mortality statistics: between 2011 and 2014, [2,380][kilodeath] disabled people died after being declared "fit to work" (and so after having their main income removed). The newspaper and blog discussionof this fact is sloppy, even by the pitiful standards of public policy debate.

In particular: **You cannot infer anything about a program's impact from a single number, without a reference class.** It took me exactly 10 seconds to find age-adjusted data on deaths in this subpopulation, compared to the general population, before _and_ after the imposition of WCA <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>:<br><br>

There. If I was a journalist or an activist, I'd wrap up here: clearly Tory welfare reforms have been miraculous, having saved hundreds of disabled people's lives on net. Somehow.

The following is just a statistical argument. All I can say for it is that it is less pig-ignorant than going around parroting the uncontrolled, uncalibrated figure.

Death after "fit for work" WCA: 		2,380 
Dead after unsuccessful DWP appeal:		1,360
Dead ESA recipients, 2016:				50,580




## Age distribution of disabled people

Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) 


## Comorbidity


We could reduce uncertainty with data on cause of death - hypothermia and suicide being evidence of WCA killing, and decompensation of chronic illnesses being null evidence.


## Note on data

People [struggled with the DWP][struggle] to get these figures published. This is sometimes read as an admission of guilt. But given how naively the 2,380 figure was received, it is hard to blame them for their cowardly reticence.
