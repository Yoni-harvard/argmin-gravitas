## Health

* <a href="{{bow}}">Bowflex SelectTech 552</a> dumbbell (£180). By my desk; much harder to avoid than the gym. 15 dumbbells in one. I love how little space they take, and the design is extremely satisfying. You can get by with one.<br>


<!-- * Electric toothbrush. Somehow much less boring. This one buzzes when you've done 2 mins too.<br> -->

* <a href="{{green}}">Powdered greens</a> (£25 for 100 days). I like leafy veg, but the cost and the low shelf-life makes me eat it less than I want. I mix 10g of this into my morning shakes and feel virtuous at least. Wait for the 40% deals.<br>

* <a href="{{zinc1}}">Zinc acetate</a> lozenges. There's <a href="{{zinc2}}">some evidence</a> that keeping particular ligands of zinc in your mouth when you have a cold speeds up your recovery, maybe by a full day. Many other viruses also perish under zincky attention, so they're out of stock as of Spring 2020.<br>

* <a href="{{mask}}">Sleep mask</a>. You want one which curves away from your eyelashes and isn't too hot. This is excellent.<br>

* <a href="{{oxy}}">Oxymetazoline</a> (£8 for months). Never mind the Vicks or the steam bath. This clears your nose in seconds; makes sleeping when ill _much_ easier.<br>

## Food

* <a href="{{q}}">Queal shakes</a> (£1 per meal). I was skeptical at first: "complete meals" (artificial food) seem procrustean (assuming dietary science is finished) and joyless. But it's based on oats and soy protein. This dissolves much better than Huel and has loads of flavours. I pad it out with rice protein powder and so usually get about 5 shakes out of a bag.<br>

* <a href="{{msg}}">MSG powder</a> (£4 for 200 meals). Average vegan food is good but just needs a lot more fat and umami. I get the latter from a sprinkling of magic dusts (MSG and <a href="{{noo}}">nutritional yeast</a>). There is no good evidence that it has any negative health effects, and in fact it's a little healthier than table salt (less sodium).<br>

* You want one good chef's knife. (You hurt yourself less with a really sharp knife since its motion is more predictable.) I just bought a random £25 one in Tesco and it is excellent.



## Productivity

* <a href="{{fil}}">Filco Majestouch mechanical keyboard</a> (£99). Feels amazing, built like a tank. The noise takes some getting used to. I went for Red switches (quieter but also less tactile). I don't need a numpad but _maybe_ you do. (PS: you have to love <a href="{{jp}}">Japanese web design</a>, as long as you don't have to rely on it.)<br>

* <a href="{{sub}}">Sublime Text</a> (£35). I do basically of my writing and coding in this. Wonderful search, regex, markdown, and build options. Packages for everything. There are languages that really need IDEs (Java comes to mind), but I don't write in em. You can get it free, but I wanted to support it. I hear VS Code is even better but I am content.<br>

* This blog is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, they are amazing and free for small fry.<br>

* <a href="{{bose}}">Bose QuietComfort 25</a> (£100). Being able to turn down noise is a superpower: actual focus. They even made working in an open plan office intermittently tolerable. They don't work _that_ well on conversations, but are excellent for humming appliances, engine roar, wind. Lasted 3.5 years so far. These are the wired ones because I resented paying an extra £100 for a transponder; I've had to replace the cable twice, £15.<br>

* <a href="{{nic}}">Nicotine lozenges</a> (8p a day). <a href="{{nic}}">Better than caffeine</a>. Vaping is cheaper but riskier and restricted in many locations. Takes a little while to get used to the mild burning. This is the only thing on this list with real risks. _DO NOT EAT A WHOLE ONE WHEN YOU START; start with 0.5mg or less and don't swallow it_.<br>

* <a href="{{marv}}">Amazing Marvin</a> is the nicest to-do list ever. It's programmable and supports dozens of different productivity systems, recurring reminders, timers, whatever. Lifetime subscription is pretty cheap during Xmas sales too.<br>

* <a href="{{korn}}">45W Corn Light</a> (£20). I don't have SAD, but during winter I noticed a little bump in mood and energy from hanging up 3 of these very bright blue LED clusters. Each is about 400W equivalent in terms of halogen bulbs.<br>

* A physical Tomato Timer. I forget that the pomodoro work technique exists, so this helps with that.<br>


* In the UK, <a href="{{pcs}}">PCSpecialist</a> sell fast cheap Taiwanese laptops, to spec. Roughly 40% more computer for a given price than Dell. I've had a Lafite III for 2 years, going strong (though it runs hot when working hard). Great customer service too.

* I don't know if it counts as productivity, since I spend about an hour a day playing with it, but <a href="{{roam}}">Roam</a> is the best personal knowledge base software I've seen. Text, maths, code, images, bidirectional links, single-copy imports... It promises to unify me across decades. (My blogs also do this, but only for the top 1% of thoughts.) Workflowy and Notion are a tree: Roam is the awesome power of a graph, which is what thoughts are like. Currently free, soon to be pricey.



## Security

* <a href="{{kee}}">KeePassX</a> password manager (£0). Works on every platform: Linux, Win, Mac, Android. Probably saves a few minutes a week and a lot of mental overhead. See <a href="/browser">here</a> for why you want this.<br>

* <a href="{{etf}}">Vanguard ETFs</a>. One of the most surprising facts is that automatic index funds outperform "actively managed" (paying a finance person) ones, after you subtract their fees. Vanguard are the original and are among the lowest fees, about 0.15% of your return. I use a variant of <a href="{{simp}}">the Simplicity Portfolio</a> and rebalance every 6 months. Some of you may be happy that they are "<a href="{{bloom}}">communist</a>" too. Above I said that only nicotine has any real risk but these are a layer of abstraction over the stock market, so obviously be careful.<br>

## Fun

* <a href="{{ks}}">KS Miami</a> bluetooth speaker (£20). Surprisingly good bass; makes watching things on a laptop much less dreadful. Good battery life too.<br>

* Tailored socks. One of my favourite possessions. I have socks which _actually_ fit for the first time. (The creator took 6 measurements!) It was a gift, but I would probably pay £30 for them.<br>

* Two actually nice shirts (<a href="{{haw}}">£40</a>). There are a lot of weddings in my life at the moment. And besides that it's nice to surprise people once in a while.<br>

* Fairy lights make all rooms nicer, any time of year.

Why write this? One of the big bottlenecks to improving your life is just knowing that it's possible to improve a given part. For some reason people don't share their data on this, probably due to a reaction against vulgar consumerism.
