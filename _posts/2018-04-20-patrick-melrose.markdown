Marvelous despite being filled with suffering and self-pity. Patrick's detachment from, humour about, his own inner life makes the books rise above him. Most of the series is not in Patrick's head, but instead depicts his brutal gilded circle. Even so, every few pages, there is a moment of beautiful lucidity or (unvoiced) empathy. The prose, the comedy, the sadness are almost enough to make you glad, with Patrick, that his parents are dead.<br/>

The prose is brilliantly polished, but I took my time, jolted out every few pages by something demanding reflection: "_Evil is sickness celebrating itself_";
<blockquote>Just as a novelist may sometimes wonder why he invents characters who do not exist and makes them do things which do not matter, so a philosopher may wonder why he invents cases that cannot occur in order to determine what must be the case. <br/></blockquote>

Underneath the filth and irony, philosophical questions are natural and urgent for Patrick. The long discursions on mind and epistemology are both more motivated and more seamless than any novel I can think of.<br/><br/>

At one point, Mary dismisses the idea that her son's anxiety and angst, so like his father's, could have a genetic component - and thus assumes that it has somehow leaked out of Patrick's behaviour. (She goes on to leave him, actually making a damage-control argument about removing the children from his, helpless, influence.)

Yes: For all his insight, wit, cynicism, contrarianism, St Aubyn is still stuck in a giant contemporary ideology: the <a href="{{nur}}">nurture assumption</a>, the culture of <a href="{{env}}">environment-only development</a> and essential woundedness.

People get wounded all the time, and being able to say so in public is a great gain (for one thing, no one in a confessional culture has to assume they are alone, that their defects are bizarrely theirs. But if trauma is the centre of some people's sense of self - if it is incentivised, e.g. misery memoirs and high-clap Medium posts)... The risks of centring such things are large and underreported: self-fulfilling prophecies, agonising rumination, and the loss of the peace and pleasure of gratitude.

St Aubyn is correct about our sad path-dependence - he just places the start of the path too late. <a href="{{markers}}">Here are genetic markers</a> that predict anxiety and PTSD a bit (more to come, it's a young method), against the novel's tacit, almost Freudian emphasis on environment alone. Or maybe I am being too literal, and St Aubyn is not endorsing.<br/><br/>

Aubyn is obviously somewhat detached from his own trauma - you can't write prose this fair and glowing if you're not - which is lucky. Otherwise, the seeker after truth would be senselessly telling the vulnerable they're deluded about their own life. (As we all are, though not in the same ways.)<br/><br>

Serious engagement with philosophy of mind throughout:
<blockquote>In any case, he now felt in danger all the time. Danger of liver collapse, marital breakdown, terminal fear. Nobody ever died of a feeling, he would say to himself, not believing a word of it, as he sweated his way through the feeling that he was dying of fear. People died of feelings all the time, once they had gone through the formality of materializing them into bullets and bottles and tumours. <br/></blockquote>

More generally, Patrick actually wrestles with materialism, rather than using the usual literary tricks of caricature and omission.<br/><br/>

Curious whether St Aubyn got his vicious rendition of Princess Margaret at <a href="{{marg}}">first- or second-hand</a>.<br/><br/>

The first three chapters of _Mother's Milk_, told from the perspective of Patrick's first child, are just perfect writing. Robert sees only the benevolence and humour of his parents, not their exhaustion, rage, and bad faith. They are anonymous to him and us, just "Robert's mother" and "Robert's father". It is a high echelon, though it gives the rest of the book a very long way to fall.

<blockquote>Thomas [2 years old] still knew how to understand the silent language which Robert [new-born] had almost lost as the wild margins of his mind fell under the sway of a verbal empire. He was standing on a ridge, about to surge downhill, getting faster, getting taller, getting more words, getting bigger and bigger explanations, cheering all the way. Now Thomas had made him glance backwards and lower his sword for a moment while he noticed everything he had lost as well. He had become so caught up in building sentences that he had almost forgotten the barbaric days when thinking was like a splash of colour on a page. <br/></blockquote><br/>

The exaggeration of the wisdom of children is even stronger in _Mother's Milk_. This is no criticism because St Aubyn isn't very committed to realism, and because Robert's rich and sparkling inner life suits one of the themes: that children deserve to be treated well, taken relatively seriously, as do we all. That purpose is not the same as result ('telos' indeed):
<blockquote>We think the purpose of a child is to grow up because it does grow up. But its purpose is to play, to enjoy itself, to be a child. If we merely look to the end of the process, the purpose of life is death. <br/></blockquote><br/>

I don't know what in these is totally fictional and I don't need to know. The art of <a href="{{kin}}">kintsugi</a>.

	<h3>Literariness as meanness and frailty</h3>
	<div>
		Some distinguishing marks of contemporary literary fiction are cynicism, neurosis, and incompetence in every adult character. It often captures subtle forms of obsession, self-sabotage, and malice, and often reflects on the contingency of past mores. It rarely reflects on the contingency of current ideas, current neuroses, current, on what is next. Technological progress is notably absent. (Climate doom and deep-ecology misanthropy is one exception.)<br><br>

		<a href="{{mac}}">MacFarquhar</a>:<br>
		<blockquote>
			the absence of unambiguously altruistic characters is almost one of the things that marks highbrow fiction as such... genre fiction is filled with far more heroism than higher culture...<br> I talked about this with a novelist. I said, “What is wrong with you novelists? Why don’t you write about heroic characters who are moved by a sense of moral duty?” He gave me this look of total contempt like I had asked him to write about bunnies or butterflies.

		<blockquote>
			Palmer’s series suggests that science fiction should not be viewed as just another literary genre, but as the genre where Enlightenment — the hope of radical self-improvement, the dream that we might control our own fate as a species — takes refuge...

		Why are the Ballardian, the Orwellian, and the Kafkaesque the animating spirits of contemporary literary life? 
<!--  -->
		Because they haven't noticed that many things are getting better? Because it doesn't suit their political programme to say so?
