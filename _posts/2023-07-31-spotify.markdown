Everything you do on Spotify is public by default. But this isn't emphasised, and I don't know anyone who takes much advantage of this (besides stumbling on user playlists in the course of your own missions). So it's the most solipsistic social network. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a>

<!-- It doesn't emphasise other users at all. This obscures the fact that you can by default see anyone, and walk their graph. -->

This false privacy means there's little incentive to lie, e.g. to pretend to like cool things you don't actually like.

Coupled to the fact that music is the centre of most(?) people's emotional lives, you thus get a uniquely sincere and <a href="{{inv}}">far-reaching representation</a> of us. Peoplewatching, but for feelings.

3. Best of [artist]. Or <a href="{{dyl}}">weirder</a> views of artist.<br>

## Some little-known scholars of popular music

I took a little walk around the user graph, looking for remarkable things. The following all impressed me with erudition or sheer determination (some of them have thousands of playlists; some have hundreds of more playlists than they have followers).

I am quite serious in calling them scholars and have no doubt that I have missed the greatest of them, surely among the greatest music scholars alive.

This is not counting the paid geezers ("<a href="{{ed}}">playlist editors</a>") who publish as "Spotify". They are the central nodes, more influential than any music journalist. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a> :

### Structuration

Even if, like many users, you don't follow anyone else, you are still affected by users, because they are the ultimate source of what you get recommended. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a> This is just a legible version of [how you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization) [came to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuration_theory) and continue to change.

It is completely unsurprising that Spotify <a href="{{wave}}">often</a> <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-spotify-discovers-the-genres-of-tomorrow">discovers</a> and <a href="https://www.thefader.com/2020/12/02/escape-room-genre-spotify-unwrapped-explanation-every-noise-glenn-mcdonald">names</a> genres now. No one else can see what is happening at and abstract.

<br>

### The forbidden sociology of emotion

This is the richest dataset in the world about music's functions, about trends, about curation and creativity. It's like getting a partial diary for 500 million people. But it's probably not good to use it for this, given that it _feels_ private to most users. 

Still, you could use their historical data (pre-2014) to see the effect of algorithms on listening patterns and so the emotional life of a whole society. The emanations of the [echo nest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Echo_Nest).

<br>

### Self-serving paean to curators

Musical culture is too large for anyone to even survey. We needed <a href="{{xgau}}">Christgau</a>, we needed <a href="{{scar}}">Scaruffi</a>, we needed <a href="{{hull}}">Hull</a>, to find jewels in the dross and more importantly structure in the great noise. 

Frankly we need this more than we need another great band. <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a> Something is lost without curation and interpretation. This post is me doing my bit on the third order.
