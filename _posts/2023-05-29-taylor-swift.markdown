Pop music is good. Songwriting teams are good. Precision is good. Strategy is good. Working your arse off is good. People liking things is good. <a href="{{t}}">Artists making money</a> is good. Admitting you are a trash-fire human being is good. And reinventing yourself is good. <!-- Serial monogamy is good. Narcissist art is often great. Trash is good. Dancing in heels is impressive I guess. Singers who can't sing very well are good. She acknowledges her team frequently even if you lot don't. -->

So why does Taylor Swift (your reception of Taylor Swift) make me feel like I have ants beneath my skin? 

I think it's because I am seeing a machine (<a href="{{c1}}">a series</a> <a href="{{c2}}">of large</a> <a href="{{c3}}">corporations</a> and 40+ ghostwriters and designers and <a href="{{law}}">lawyers</a> <a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6">6</a>) represent itself as a singular human being I am to empathise with. Then a large part of society greets this machine as an artist ("the _person_ who has come up with"). Like a long line of ducklings imprinted on a combine harvester.

Call the machine <a href="{{trademark}}">TS</a>. The interesting part is that Swift the human built TS the machine and controls it to some extent. A _self_-manufactured pop star: Swift makes the machine seem like her and feeds it vast hosts of people (fans, co-writers, boyfriends, enemies, bloggers). The project is reflexive: it makes songs about its own controversies, songs which lead to even more fame, fame which automatically produces more controversies.

TS presents itself as Swift. It performs characters (<a href="{{c}}">Cinderella</a>, <a href="{{hark}}">Rebekah Harkness</a>) and at the same time pretends to deeply express Swift the woman. It performed innocence (and a twang) for Nashville and now performs demisexuality (and FKA-sighing) for the glossies, BPD (and drawling) for the extremely online, and a persecution complex (and diphthongs) for everyone <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>.

That's half of it; the other half is your incredible overestimation of the output. <a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13">13</a>  TS songs are moderately catchy, (recently) moderately perverse, and expertly ape The Current Thing (Shania Twain / Faith Hill / Kelly Clarkson / Jenny Lewis / Lady Gaga / Kesha / Lana del Rey / Lorde / FKA Twigs / <!--St Vincent--> Billie Eilish / whoever it is now). But TS is noticeably flatter than any of these. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>

Why does the music's reception matter if the music doesn't matter? Well, I dislike things that pretend to be deep when they're not. Things which pretend to be personal are on tricky aesthetic ground. Entertainment is fine but not when it stands in place of art. We used to be iffy about parasocial relationships, corporate machines, being played.

I realise now that Swift _is_ a kind of artist – but the art is not music, it's marketing. Empire-building. Really ingenious <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2016/7/12/16039240/when-did-you-first-realize-taylor-swift-was-lying-to-you-bb5a00a32b65">image management</a>, audience relationship management, and hiring. She weathered <a href="{{prob}}">culture war</a> struggle sessions completely fine; people have repeatedly <a href="{{sady}}">announced</a> her demise, critics have bleated about the derivativeness and hollowness of the songs - and yet here she is. These feats require intelligence, deep cultural awareness, and cold blood. So if the music is uninteresting the phenomenon isn't. She plays the world like a fiddle.

Three different industry roles run together in Swift:

* the Impresario (Tin Pan Alley / Brill / Music Row / Colonel Parker / A&R exec scouting and team-building and hitmaking)
* the Manufactured Popstar (Kylie / Britney / Katy / Selena / Ariana)
* the Songwriting Chameleon (Lou Reed / Bowie / Madonna) <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>

She appears to be the best in the business at two of these and serviceable at the other. <a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12">12</a> 

<!-- Dolly was impresario and popstar -->

After tuning, it tells us what we want to hear.)

    <h3>What?</h3>
    <div>
        Art music exists and isn't the same as pop music. Attention is limited; true artistic appreciation is 1000 times more limited. TS is fine except insofar as it stands in place of art music, a switcharoo you lot are pulling on yourselves. Fake things (as opposed to fictions) struggle to attain greatness.<br><br>
        <!--  -->
        I like analysing stuff. In the course of making that plea for demarcation, I found actually interesting things about TS. (When you are faced with something with no merit, you always have the option of anthropology: stepping back and studying the fans, working out the deep things any phenomenon <i>of this size</i> will say about culture. The world in a grain of sand, in the flash of the feed.)

### Poptimism

It's uncomfortable to be out here proclaiming about Art vs Pop; 10 years ago I was on the other side, of the <a href="{{pop}}">poptimists</a> (who said that pop is good and worth talking about). I welcome us no longer pretending that pop music is bad music; I welcome us no longer doing violence to our own taste.

<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">selling out is when you exchange cultural capital (appeal to elite tastemakers) for real capital (marketability to the dirty, unwashed masses)</p>&mdash; nihilism disrespecter (@meaning_enjoyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/meaning_enjoyer/status/1664484493443624960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>

Pop's aims and criteria are just vastly different from that of art music and I want space for the latter. Midcult machines like TS steal this space <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>. <a href="{{scar2}}">Scaruffi</a>'s radical conservatism:

> Art Music differs from Commercial Music the way a Monet painting differs from IKEA furniture. Although the border is frequently fuzzy... [we can still say that] being an art musician is a different kind of job, more similar to the job of the scientific researcher (and the old-fashioned inventor) than to the job of the popular entertainer...<br><br>The goal of an art musician is, first and foremost, to do what s/he feels is important and, secondly, to secure a place in the history of human civilization... Art music knows no stylistic boundaries: the division in classical, jazz, rock, hip hop and so forth still makes sense for commercial music (it basically identifies the sales channel) 

Macdonald, quoted above, carries a lot of baggage about the outsized importance of novels and elite cultural stewardship. But we don't need any of that to take the key point: pure pop is better than pop which is pretending to be art. (Some art music finds commercial success.)

<!-- I think collaborative art usually sucks but it's not because multiple people are working on it. -->

<br>

> Quincy Jones: "We need more songs, man. Fucking songs, not hooks."<br>
INTERVIEWER: Some people consider her the great songwriter of our age.<br>
QJ: laughs. "Whatever crumbles your cookie."<br>
INTERVIEWER: What's missing?<br>
QJ: "Knowing what you're doing...<br>
INTERVIEWER: Plenty of people talk as though Taylor Swift has great songs.<br>
QJ: "But they don't know, man. They don't know. I've come and gone through seven decades of this shit. Seen all that. Seen how that works. Ignorance is no thing."


<br>

#### The economics of art

Once something costs <a href="{{a}}">$140m</a> to make, certain forms of art become impossible. You cannot take risks, aesthetic or physical. You cannot improvise. You must appeal broadly, probably too broadly to be yourself, unless your soul is already a common denominator. <a href="{{truck}}">Logistics, an iron constraint on vision</a>.

This is why I put up with bad production and sloppy musicianship: the higher the budget, the less likely I am to see any true experiment and idiosyncracy and deviance, which is what I want from art and often from entertainment too. Music is very cheap compared to other artforms (<a href="{{riri}}">barely a million</a> per hit), which is why we still see a modicum of experiment in popular songs.

I think the usual mechanism is that the execs meddle to ensure that they recoup their investment. And committee art is generally inferior because it takes us further from honesty and idiosyncracy. TS has sponsors and <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/about/newsroom/taylor-swift-the-eras-tour-presale">"partners"</a> to please, but I doubt they're let into the writing room explicitly. <a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8">8</a>

<br>

### the parasocial

> [Fan's] devotion to Taylor Swift runs so deep that she feels as if she can trust her like a friend. After the pop star encouraged fans to vote in the 2018 midterm elections, Ms. Smith registered. The 23-year-old’s most recent rite of passage — getting her first credit card — was also prompted by the singer.

<br>

> people on tumblr and twitter really don’t like to separate art from the artist, for example the artist Adele, or Taylor Swift. Everything has to be about the person Taylor Swift, and the kabbalistic implications of pieces of the lyrics. It’s not enough for people to like or not like her music. It’s all about Taylor Swift existing in the public eye, criticism is criticism of her person, her life... even the posts that criticise... feel painfully parasocial.

This part of the machine is really interesting. The romantic singer-songwriter tradition says that music is good to the extent that it honestly expresses one person's feelings. So how can it be bad that she talks about her love life, and people respond to it?

One thing: TS is simultaneously an optimised hit factory which tracks stylistic trends in the charts and creates products in response, _and_ an extension of gossip-mag voyeurism. The songs are more explicit about its celeb subjects than past love / revenge songs. You can read her <a href="{{diary}}">diary</a>. It's a product to a greater degree than everything else is now a product. (You lot would go parasocial regardless of how private Swift was, but as it is it's cultivated in a way which makes me run screaming.)

Another is that melding public and private _destroys_ the private. Living in public prevents you being yourself (think of the self-censorship alone), which undermines the romantic artist story another way <a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9">9</a>. 

There are various plays for sympathy in the music - which are possibly even honest, but they remain plays. (e.g. The absurd premise of "Reputation" is that she is a victim, needs defenders. Maybe she really is trapped inside TS, the cage she intentionally constructed.)

(What's the difference between people delighting in her outfits and new beau and me loving every anecdote I can get about <a href="/frank">Frank Ramsey</a>? Well, one of them is a human being who lived for himself, rather than a giant mech running a fuzzing attack on your emotions with a human player inside.)

Yet another strat: the pretence that TS is uncool, the victim of snobbery, mean girls, <a href="{{shake}}">haters</a>, paps, hacks, <a href="{{miso}}">misogyny</a>. (She's uncool, like you. She's bullied, like you. Being a fan of her is brave and kind.) Apparently this has an actual referent in Swift's misfit teen experience, but it becomes a grotesque pose in the light of TS' global <a href="{{obama}}">supremacy</a>. A side effect of the pretence is pre-empting essays like this. Haters are going to hate.

### authenticity

<br>


> it’s a little foolish to knock Taylor Swift for basing her brand on authentic teenage experiences that she never actually had for the same reason that it’s naive to point out that William Shakespeare wasn’t an Italian teenager willing to die for love; the art is separate from the artist, and the better the artist the less likely they actually have any personal experience in what they’re arting.

<br>

The machine is most visible in its precision and repetition (Sittenfeld notices it in the exact reproduction, every show, of that giggle from "Shake It Off"). But James Brown was much <a href="{{dick}}">more of a dick</a> about precision, and I don't view him as a lesser artist because of it.

Authenticity is a very stupid idea in a lot of ways. It's ahistorical - katsu curry is a Japanese adaptation of the British adaptation of the Indian recipe, much of the <a href="{{ital}}">Italian menu canon</a> didn't exist 100 years ago but is now fiercely gatekept as the essence of Italian culture - it prevents innovation, it has made some great artists superstitiously avoid money (or <a href="{{cobain}}">kill themselves</a>). But look at the alternative.

(One difference between Shakespeare writing about Veronese gang kids and TS writing about high school kids is that Shakey wasn't pretending to be a Veronese gang kid.)

Pop as a whole is obviously larger and more literally hegemonic than little old TS: it ate gospel, it ate country, it ate jazz, it ate rock, it ate punk, it ate hip-hop, it ate <a href="{{elec}}">various</a> weird obtuse electronic genres, it ate lo-fi, and it wears their skins whenever it likes. TS is just one little corner of this larger machine; TS only works at all because of pop's debasement of the "indie" category over the last 20 years. "Indie" was an economic category meaning "not a machine product". Choosing this economic niche meant you weren't very interested in being popular, and so "indie" also connoted a cluster of intensely personal kinds of weird rock. "Indie" now means "has guitars and vaguely depressed vocals" and it is prominent among corporate releases - corporate indie, overproduced lo-fi, pensive strumming with no thoughts. (The upside of this debasement is to make pop larger: irony, self-doubt and negativity are now options for hitmakers, and this makes the charts less monotonous.)


For all Swift's grinding and shrewdness, TS is in this sense just a splinter cell of the same spontaneous order that created Britney, Katy Perry, Demi Lovato, Halsey, Meghan Trainor, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez. Her diphthongs are far from the full absurd <a href="{{indie}}">Indie Pop Vocal</a> (except in moments like "<a href="{{oiim}}">oiiim insane</a>"), and the autotune is subtler. <a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11">11</a> I can't improve on <a href="{{vox}}">this analysis</a> of how the TS image is engineered. 


<div class="accordion">
    <h3>Aping the 90s girl</h3>

        Yet another current that runs through TS is the defiant/seething/heavy-lidded post-grunge <a href="{{nine}}">90s girl</a> - think Fiona Apple, Alanis, Sinead O’Connor, Courtney Love. TS dilutes it, of course: uses the attitude while completely dropping the look. But making whole _albums_ full of miserable angry pop remains a minor achievement. The imperfect girlfriend and vengeful ex remain underrepresented in the charts.

    <h3>Lawyering up</h3>
    <div>
        The Guardian grants TS' absurd, unprecedented lawfare the benefit of the doubt, matey journalistic licence. It's actually kind of liberatory that she is trademarking phrases she did not coin.
        <blockquote>This is arguably less about her wanting to boil every single thing she does down to a “revenue stream” and more about a pre-emptive strike against callously opportunistic third parties who might want to make money off her without either her involvement or her say-so.</blockquote>

The most interesting things about Swift were harder to discover: she's a sort of <a href="{{hs}}">high school dropout</a>; she started her career at 13 as a genuine social misfit; she remains a massive hustler who doesn't seem to regret her child-star path, and who outdoes any cupidinous rapper re: stacks <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a>.

> David Bowie turned marketing into the essence of his art. All great phenomena of popular music, from Elvis Presley to the Beatles, had been, first and foremost, marketing phenomena... With Bowie... art and marketing become one... Bowie was... the heir, no matter how perverted, of Andy Warhol's pop art... He [made underground transgressive art into] precisely what [it] had been designed to fight: a commodity.

Most machines stop iterating once they find a hypersuccessful selling point. TS is thus in a rare category along with Bowie and Madonna: the red queens. TS found massive success by presenting as a chaste country girl; a stadium dance-pop star running family-friendly S&M; an oversexed indie grrl; a politically-aware ally; a goth bedroom-recording-studio murmurer ...

Bowie changed so often because there was nothing underneath. He is the great artist of surfaces. (He was also thoughtful enough that we should credit him with intentional rebellion against the pop/art and fake/authentic spectrums.) The difference is his quality and prescience: he managed to pre-empt glam, prog, vanilla funk, punk, AOR, new wave, and Online. He was a leading indicator, where TS is lagging. 

Madonna is a much better fit; the constant try-hard <a href="{{mad}}">iteration</a>, the artful use of superficiality, sex, and the celeb racket. The lauded versatility ultimately boiling down to a couple of flavours of pop.

<!-- > her image was reflected not only on large screens on either side of the stage but also on the single biggest screen that I’ve seen in my life, which, curiously, faced the backs of most of the crowd and the front of only Swift herself, lending it a mirror-above-the-bed quality of self-interest notable even in these highly narcissistic times. -->

Where will TS be in 20 years? Bowie's fate or Madonna's? <a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7">7</a> (Madonna also had 10 no.1 albums, but aside from a couple of eternal singles it's fading into the nostalgia noise level.)

<br>

Also: God knows what <a href="{{grimes}}">TS or its successor</a> will be like when augmented with <a href="{{elf}}">actual machines</a>. Maybe we will come to see TS as clumsy broadcast propaganda compared to the coming <a href="{{hyper}}">personalised midculture</a>.


<!-- ### What instead?

* Fiona Apple
* Regina Spektor
* Joanna Newsom
* Jenny Lewis
* Grimes
* Alanis Morissette
* Björk
* Liz Phair
* Kate Bush
* And in fact any of the other machines TS harvests. Dolly. Faith Hill / Kelly Clarkson / Kesha / Lana del Rey / Lorde / <a href="{{weeks}}">FKA Twigs</a>. Gaga, why not. -->


It would not amaze me if this post ended up feeding TS in its way (bloggers have been useful to it before). What a machine!

    <h3>what's good</h3>
    <div>
        I quite like the Max Martin numbers "Style", "Blank Space", "Shake it Off", "I Knew You Were Trouble". ("We Are Never" shows its gears and emotional pulleys too nakedly for me to forgive it.) Antonoff's "Dress" is a FKA knock-off, still good. Of the solo work, "Enchanted" is perfect in its way (Carmichael just did the strings; I think nearly none of TS' arrangements are Swift).
    </div>
    <!--  -->
    <h3>lyricist</h3>
    <div>
        I'm told that Swift's own self-conception and real talents lie in lyric-writing. I don't see it but will quote <a href="{{kontext}}">Kontextmaschine</a> for completeness:
        <br><br>
<!--  -->
        <blockquote>Okay, yes the vocabulary and grammatical structure is pitched at an eighth-grade reading level; her work is pitched at an eighth-grade audience. But that’s hardly to say there’s no depth to her lyrics, it’s just that a lot of it relies on semantic overloading, and particularly semantic overloading that specifically plays on her bridging of popular music genres.<br><br>
        To simplify, pop-rock lyrics tend to set a mood while country lyrics tell a story, but Taylor Swift lyrics tend to craft an atmosphere in which individual lines suggest a story or multiple stories (which listeners can fill in, according to the specifics of their own lives or daydreams), which can in turn be taken as literal or as metaphors.</blockquote>
