Many of my tasteful friends disdain even his soft hi-fi work, and some of my tasteless friends are much enamoured of the lot. Just like anyone, I cannot rule out 'adaptive preferences', that I like it because I've put a lot into it.

There's just a lot to it. He has a lot to say, a lot to remember. He does a dozen interviews a year, and I watch em all, and he remains full of new stories, recommendations, enthusiasms and disgusts. 

B sides, deep cuts, no cuts.

Major-key desolation

Completism like this post is out of keeping with the man himself. Darnielle <i>likes</i> lost arcana. And his live shows are exciting because there is much old treasure, quite beside the new, quite besides the stories, and quite besides his joy.

The autobiographical ones can be split into childhood, vampires, and .


The hoarse yell of deviance

His latter albums, what with less screaming, are only boring if you donâ€™t know the pre-2002 holler; the careful mutter of Life of the World is absolutely an art choice.


My album ranking is mostly a function of the constituent songs' ranking. Though some work together to greater effect, like Tallahassee or MCB.

All of these songs can receive a +3 at a given live performance.
The trouble is that between AHWT and TLotWTC he became a musician. I love the demos of the recent smooth albums. There only used to be demos.
