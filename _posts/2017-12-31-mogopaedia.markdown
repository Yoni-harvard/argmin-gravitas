Reality has a lot of <a href="{{detail}}">lore</a>. But not enough, so we make more.

The world of the Mountain Goats is an entire little world, with fallen civilizations and frightening violence and opinions about little truck stops outside Gothenburg. It has a history _and a historiography_.

Many of my tasteful friends disdain even his softer hi-fi work, and some of my tasteless friends are much enamoured of the whole lot. Just like anyone, I cannot rule out that I like it <a href="{{adap}}">because</a> I've put a lot of work into it.

There's just a lot to it. He has a lot to say, a lot to remember. He does a dozen interviews a year, and I watch em all, and he remains full of new stories, recommendations, enthusiasms and disgusts. He writes where others only output text.

You might think that writing this long post makes me some kind of superfan but I am not. (I only ever bought the CDs.)

It's impossible to be the Darnielle completist I am. On top of the maybe 400 commercial objects, are <a href="{{THESHEET}}">way more</a> than 400 tracks of arcana: a completed unreleased album, three dozen online-only ephemeral downloads, a hundred covers, a hundred live-only bootleg-only songs, a 30 known "missing" songs, dozens of songs with no attestation but a title or a verse, and who knows how many more we couldn't snatch from him out of the air. Thirteen songs are actively disowned and forbidden and he asks you not to listen; one or two are deprecated for <a href="{{fem}}">feminist</a> reasons. <a href="{{ark}}">Some of his best</a> have been performed exactly once, and probably never again.

You _could_ view this as ingenious marketing (artificial scarcity _and_ artificial grandeur) except most people don't know and don't care about the 

Still, a real fan couldn't write this post or concoct this data. I'm past all that.

1. cut. higher standards than you'd think for a guy with 800 songs
2. love of easter eggs and arcana
3. personal pique and family songs

Lots going on. Ex-con. Recovered junkie. Quasi-Christian. English major / classicist lifelong-learner type. Metalhead. Dad. MTG nerd. Twitter liberal. Strong opinions about contemporary French translation.

Scholar-novel. The key is outcasts, the equivalence of heretics and scapegoats, speedfreaks and metalheads in rural Christian towns. Despite his own deep vibing with Christianity!! SFPC is about Christianity destroying paganism in deeply unchristian* brutality

\* that is, doing so in a fashion which is very Christian empirically, but not very Christian normatively



The greatest song about democracy.

My gf can't listen to him because he's too sad / neurotic on record. But he is ecstatic and jolly on stage. Major-key desolation

Completism like this post is out of keeping. Darnielle <i>likes</i> lost arcana. (This was him joking: "Plenty of people take up painting; me, I like to hand-make little booklets and tuck them away in a shoebox where they'll never be seen again. There are twenty-two such booklets so far, and they're some of the best work I've ever done, and my plan is to bury them in the backyard when I've finished with them. In partial shade. Near the raspberry bushes." But it is not outside the realm of possibility.)

And his live shows are exciting because there is much old treasure, quite beside the new, quite besides the stories, and quite besides his joy.

The autobiographical ones can be split into childhood, vampires (drug squatting), and .

One hair-raising fact is that 5 fansites have done what I am doing and <a href="">all</a> of them are <a href="{{horse}}">dead</a>.

## Things he has some scholarly grasp of

Latin grammar
Black Sabbath
Early education
The original wave of Dungeons and Dragons and the Satanic Panic
American professional wrestling in its regional days (NWA, UWF, AWA) before corporatization
The lo-fi and cassette scene of Pomona County, California (1988-1999)
The folk history of North Carolina
The nursing of juveniles involuntarily committed to mental institutions
Ancient history and dark age Europe
    The history of the Christianisation of the pagans of Greece and the Balkans


<br><br>

## Why ?

> there's a sense in which if you know everything about your work while you're doing it, then it's probably not very interesting work. It needs to in some ways be obscure to you. You have to be trying to chase something that you can't quite get.

> The unused [tracks] that still seem interesting to me are here as bonus tracks; there was once a third tape of the stuff I kept writing after I felt like I had enough for the album, but I threw a tempter tantrum one day years later and pitched it into the garbage, which I'd almost regret doing, except that the idea of lost and unrecoverable work has this dumb romantic appeal to me, so when I think of that tape off in oblivion somewhere, rotting away, I get the sort of moony-eyed stupid look on my face that is the exclusive domain of dumb romantics.

> Naturally, there's also more dumb romantic appeal for me in the degradation of original sources. I can't help it.

<br>

We shouldn't dismiss his hostility. The line between something being a thought and an artefact is now fiercely thin. We lay claim to his thoughts. We harvest the time-bound and scarce thoughts and freeze them, chain them to our phones. He takes some of them back.

We don't even need to push a cynical line about scarce things being more desirable.

> How do we know these songs ever existed if he never played them live?

<br><br>

THING IS THOUGH he is extremely familiar with and in recovery from the fan mindset, the speedfreak alphabetization.

## The other Mountain Goat

> [The Panasonic RX-FT500's] built-in condenser microphone didn't condense (that is, it didn't react to changes in volume by automatically contracting its diaphragm) unless the levels with which it found itself confronted were truly overwhelming, which never happened; meanwhile, oblivious to this tic of mass production, the machine's designers hadn't thought to situate the actual moving parts (that is, the gears) as far as cosmetically possible from this unusually sensitive microphone. The results were uncannily accurate representations of sound complemented and complicated by some pretty ferocious wheel-grind. 

> Sometime around 1998, the Panasonic appeared to have breathed its last. When you'd punch "Record," a large triangular piece of plastic just to the left of the spindles would begin jutting in and out of the view frame, bringing with it a clicking noise whose arrhythmic clatter could in no way be incorporated into any songs one might be trying to record on such a low-tech piece of equipment. In the summer of 2000 6 having written a few new songs that took place in Texas and being frustrated with the uniform sound of the Marantz, we hauled the Panasonic out of its corner and gave it a shot, just in case it might have repaired itself during the long time it had spent standing all alone near the window.

> The results are what you have with you now: the sound of a long-broken machine deciding, on its own and without the interference of repairmen or excessive prayer vigils, to function again... Its inexplicable self-originating will to go on echoes some of the boneheaded ideas that motivate the people who populate these little songs... 

> Of course the original signal is never actually anywhere near any recordings anywhere, but you all already knew that. You have been sure of it for quite some time now. You see the proof everywhere. It is the reason you started reading these lines in the first place.

<br>

## Workin'

> I don't remember when the album came out, or how it did, or whether it met with favorable reviews. By the time it got released I was pretty heavily into that job I'd been going through orientation for. it involved working with children in a residential setting: rich, rewarding work. I do remember bringing my first copy into work one day and playing in on the house boombox after the children had gone off to school. I watched the door closely and kept my hand near the player so my supervisor wouldn't come in just in time to hear her morning shift guy singing "hail, Satan" through the speakers, and I had few plans for the future except to keep working at all the things I liked working at. I didn't know, at the time, that this would be the last album I'd make where all the takes were live within minutes of having written the songs,


> Once you're no longer in the day job, you don't know what's going on with people... Even if you're not a hermit, you're talking to people as an observer, and an observer can never know what a participant can know... I seemed to have less to say... If a writer disengages from people at large, his ability to describe the behaviour of people is going to suffer.

## Eras

> I think there's one song in the catalogue prior to [2015] that [has modulation], and it literally only modulates on the last chord

<br>


Profound shift. Not just sound, not just lyrical attitude. From alone to jam band, raw live to overproduction.

 <!-- Stephen Malkmus, Colin Newman  -->
1. Acoustic thrash + nasal wail + panasonic + Shrimper + Young David Byrne / Tim Kinsella face (1985 - 2001). Divorces looming and mythologies coursing through the young.
2. Electric reverb + big ass studio + muttering + 4AD + John Oliver face (2002 - 2013). Autobiography begins in 2004 and tenderises him.
3. Bandy band band. Power trio. Cool Dr. habil. jaja. (2012 - 2017). Also horns.
4. Lounge four-piece flirting with jangle, country-rock, and mere autobiography (Piano + horns + saccharine sprechgesang + Merge + lookin like Serj Tankian and Anton Chigurh). Fatherhood. (2017 - Present)

The vocals go really country.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgJ8qqebM8g

It's not that I only like him screaming but there has to be the [possibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVXkXSTrqXk) of him screaming.


I can't stand (4) but it's largely just my allergy to the jazz keyboard hammond mellotron reverb and muted melisma muso production. Luckily he releases most of em as demos - better sound quality than 1993 cassettes and sometimes the same fire. Makes a 6 out of a 4 and an 7 out of a 5.

OK it's not just the sound shift but also the themes and AA-meeting flabby humanism. for GOD'S sake man i don't want your warmth and i don't need your acceptance. _Bleed Out_ is passable because the old sociopathy and mental illness comes back.

> Wild Sage was really the first song I ever wrote about mental illness.

It is the prerogative of the long time fan to get arsey about changes of direction and scream the names of the cult classics; it is the prerogative of the artist to pay literally zero attention to them.

The trouble is that between AHWT and TLotWTC he became a Musician. (He may also be attempting to gracefully sidestep the chord damage and ageing.) That doesn't explain the turn against guitars and towards jam-band I love the _demos_ of his recent smoothie albums. There only used to be demos.


(3) bores me. (Best examples: Tyler Lambert's Grave, )
The weird thing is that he is still perfectly capable of (1). He just chooses not to.

My emotions are hopelessly tied up with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zopilote_Machine#External_links">first eleven</a> Mountain Goats albums, but I will try to explain as if that were not true. Lyrically, he is one of the few <a href="http://afterallitcouldbeworse.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/listen-all-eternals-deck-2011-by.html">psychological realists</a> in rock music, i.e. like Zola or Hamsun or Henry James - but, musically, draws power directly from banality and pop culture - TV theme melodies, self-help platitudes, 80s metal and the Satanic Panic. This was also Talking Heads' claim to art. <br />

<blockquote>
<i>my interest is in really evoking place, proceeding from there. So when I write about, say, a video store in southern California in the early '90s, I call the place Cinema Video — because I knew a Cinema Video in my town and that was the style in naming these mom-and-pop video stores — nothing really fancy, something sort of placeholdery. Which was different in different parts of the country, which is interesting and evocative to me! I specify in the hopes of drawing people into a vision, so I look at street names and native flora and fauna and so on, trying to make everything vivid and visible.</i><br />

"I have always had a sort of religious awe of geography... For whatever reason, towns that I don't know anything about, I don't know where they are, what country they're in, it's just the sounds of the words, combined with the knowledge that that refers to some place, that have always rung like a bell being struck in in my head. Like 'Ah! Belize!' But I couldn't find Belize on a map to save my soul."

## Sheer breadth of reference

I often pride myself on the breadth and scrappiness of my life course. I’ve lived in 11 countries (for at least a couple months). I have arts and science. I worked 50 jobs including waiting tables and the State and the belly of a Fortune 100 bureaucracy.

But you and I are not like John. We haven’t slept in jail, got into and quit meth, watched our rentboy friends die, haven’t found ourselves in a lounge band. We feel for the methheads but not like this. We have no pangs. The good things in our lives are just good things and not miracles




## Alpha

> “[my] misunderstanding of the term ‘alpha privative’ which is the ‘a’ in front of a word that negates: moral, amoral, right. In Latin that's called alpha privative. When I first learned that I was like twenty and I was like, ‘Awesome, the letter that negates!’, you know. A couple years later I was talking to my Latin teacher about it and he was like, ‘Yeah, it just doesn’t carry that kind of force, nobody thinks of the term alpha privative as something you know, annihilating stuff.’ But I did.”

There is something wrong with this post. It imposes a system on something which he has repeatedly and . His insane hardcore live aesthetic, epitomising Real Lo-Fi, has long passed on. But the quixotic request to let some things be private, to not record him, to not photograph him. It's quixotic because recording and tabulating is unilateral. But he knows there are people like me and he's not like Grothendieck or Perelman or anything, a seraph withdrawing from the fallen world with its beady little minds like mine.

## Cataloguing

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QqFLv-lOcG6mH4fHovVqXtx4hwyGXoHFj7vnTiUYDuk/edit?usp=sharing

- He has destroyed about 50
- And about 10 have only been played live
- And several exist ambiguously - in title only perhaps
- A new track was found last year on one copy of an early cassette
- And no other copy of that cassette


## Ranking

My album ranking is mostly a function of the constituent songs' ranking. Though some work together to greater effect, like Tallahassee or MCB.

All of these songs can receive a +3 at a given live performance.

## Psychological realism

There is a whole literary genre, "<a href="http://www.jahsonic.com/PsychologicalNovel.html">psychological realism</a>", for <span style="font-style: italic;">novels</span> which focus on the details of their characters' minds. In them, self-narrative and (usually self-delusion) are more important than <span style="font-style: italic;">plot</span>, <em>truth</em>, <em>denouement</em>: the "actual" events. Does anyone write psychological rock?</p><br />

Well now <em>yes</em>. <i>All Eternals Deck</i> is just that, retaining the perfectly tuned Gothic aesthetic in which the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Psychological_novels">the later psych novels</a> wallowed.  (Note: 'psychedelic' rock is the <em>opposite</em> of what I'm looking for - it's a candy-coloured <i>flight</i> from ordinary inner life.) So<span style="font-style: italic;"> AED</span> isn't just about how frickin cool tarot or black metal is, or how real ghosts are, or any of that: it's about the power of ideas over us. Also our perversity. (To be haunted is to not let a ghost go, and not as we usually say, the converse.)</p><br />
