> "Tracking live is like that. You're actually hearing something which actually happened."

Many of my tasteful friends disdain even his soft hi-fi work, and some of my tasteless friends are much enamoured of the lot. Just like anyone, I cannot rule out 'adaptive preferences', that I like it because I've put a lot into it.


There's just a lot to it. He has a lot to say, a lot to remember. He does a dozen interviews a year, and I watch em all, and he remains full of new stories, recommendations, enthusiasms and disgusts. 

B sides, deep cuts, no cuts.

Major-key desolation

Completism like this post is out of keeping with the man himself. Darnielle <i>likes</i> lost arcana. (This was a joke: "Plenty of people take up painting; me, I like to hand-make little booklets and tuck them away in a shoebox where they'll never be seen again. There are twenty-two such booklets so far, and they're some of the best work I've ever done, and my plan is to bury them in the backyard when I've finished with them. In partial shade. Near the raspberry bushes." But it is not outside the realm of possibility.)

And his live shows are exciting because there is much old treasure, quite beside the new, quite besides the stories, and quite besides his joy.

The autobiographical ones can be split into childhood, vampires (drug squatting), and .


The hoarse yell of deviance

His latter albums, what with less screaming, are only boring if you donâ€™t know the pre-2002 holler; the careful mutter of Life of the World is absolutely an art choice.


My album ranking is mostly a function of the constituent songs' ranking. Though some work together to greater effect, like Tallahassee or MCB.

All of these songs can receive a +3 at a given live performance.
The trouble is that between AHWT and TLotWTC he became a musician. I love the demos of the recent smooth albums. There only used to be demos.



- He has destroyed about 50
- And about 10 have only been played live
- And several exist ambiguously In title only Perhaps
- A new track was found last year on one copy of an early cassette
- And no other copy of that cassette
- Sometimes We Mosh - live only, lyrics here.
