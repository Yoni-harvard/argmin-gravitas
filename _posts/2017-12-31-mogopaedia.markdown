Reality has a lot of lore. But not enough, so we make more.

It's a entire little world, with fallen civilizations and frightening violence. It has a history _and a historiography_.

Many of my tasteful friends disdain even his soft hi-fi work, and some of my tasteless friends are much enamoured of the lot. Just like anyone, I cannot rule out 'adaptive preferences', that I like it because I've put a lot into it.

There's just a lot to it. He has a lot to say, a lot to remember. He does a dozen interviews a year, and I watch em all, and he remains full of new stories, recommendations, enthusiasms and disgusts. 

You might think that writing this makes me some kind of superfan but I am not. I only ever bought the CDs.

You could view this as ingenious marketing except most people don't know and don't care

1. cut. higher standards than you'd think for a guy with 800 songs
2. love of easter eggs and arcana
3. personal pique and family songs

B sides, deep cuts, no-cuts.

Once you're no longer in the day job, you don't know what's going on with people... Even if you're not a hermit, you're talking to people as an observer, and an observer can never know what a participant can know... I seemed to have less to say... If a writer disengages from people at large, his ability to describe the behaviour of people is going to suffer.

Lots going on. Ex-con. Recovered junkie. Quasi-Christian. English major / classicist lifelong-learner type. Metalhead. Dad. MTG nerd. Twitter liberal. Strong opinions about contemporary French translation.

Scholar-novel

The greatest song about democracy.

My gf can't listen to him because he's too sad / neurotic on record. But he is ecstatic and jolly on stage. Major-key desolation

Completism like this post is out of keeping. Darnielle <i>likes</i> lost arcana. (This was him joking: "Plenty of people take up painting; me, I like to hand-make little booklets and tuck them away in a shoebox where they'll never be seen again. There are twenty-two such booklets so far, and they're some of the best work I've ever done, and my plan is to bury them in the backyard when I've finished with them. In partial shade. Near the raspberry bushes." But it is not outside the realm of possibility.)

And his live shows are exciting because there is much old treasure, quite beside the new, quite besides the stories, and quite besides his joy.

The autobiographical ones can be split into childhood, vampires (drug squatting), and .

One hair-raising fact is that 5 fansites have done what I am doing and all are dead.

> there's a sense in which if you know everything about your work while you're doing it, then it's probably not very interesting work. It needs to in some ways be obscure to you. You have to be trying to chase something that you can't quite get.

## Eras

 <!-- Stephen Malkmus, Colin Newman  -->
1. Acoustic thrash + nasal wail + panasonic + Shrimper + Young David Byrne / Tim Kinsella face (1985 - 2001)
2. Electric reverb + big ass studio + muttering + 4AD + John Oliver face (2002 - 2013)
3. Bandy band band. Cool Dr. habil. jaja. (2012 - 2017)
4. Piano + horns + saccharine sprechgesang + Merge + Serj Tankian Chigurh face (2017 - Present)


I can't stand (4) but luckily he releases all the demos
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1lGEznMoBmAyuUS8aeEzy5tUmBSZ8GQY


The trouble is that between AHWT and TLotWTC he became a Musician. (He may also be attempting to gracefully sidestep the chord damage and ageing.) That doesn't explain the turn against guitars and towards jam-band I love the _demos_ of his recent smoothie albums. There only used to be demos.


(3) bores me. (Best examples: Tyler Lambert's Grave, )
The weird thing is that he is still perfectly capable of (1). He just chooses not to.

My emotions are hopelessly tied up with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zopilote_Machine#External_links">first eleven</a> Mountain Goats albums, but I will try to explain as if that were not true. Lyrically, he is one of the few <a href="http://afterallitcouldbeworse.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/listen-all-eternals-deck-2011-by.html">psychological realists</a> in rock music, i.e. like Zola or Hamsun or Henry James - but, musically, draws power directly from banality and pop culture - TV theme melodies, self-help platitudes, 80s metal and the Satanic Panic. This was also Talking Heads' claim to art. <br />

<i>my interest is in really evoking place, proceeding from there. So when I write about, say, a video store in southern California in the early '90s, I call the place Cinema Video — because I knew a Cinema Video in my town and that was the style in naming these mom-and-pop video stores — nothing really fancy, something sort of placeholdery. Which was different in different parts of the country, which is interesting and evocative to me! I specify in the hopes of drawing people into a vision, so I look at street names and native flora and fauna and so on, trying to make everything vivid and visible.</i><br />

-- Early stuff is often very light. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deh9j4aAePg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwbRuHZ7_c<br />
<br />
-- His songs occur in a single world; there are running themes, callbacks and characterisation of desperate. Like Bukowski if he understood religion or science as well as writing and mundane pain. <br />

<br />
<big>2) 4AD (2000-9)</big><br />
<br />
By 2001, orchestration and a three-piece rock band arrive. Very often focalises psychopaths and fideists between 2000-10.<br />
<br />
-- This is the one that everyone is struck by most and first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRP6egIEABk<br />

<br />
-- Fuck everything: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyDD0PNmE2o<br />
<br />
-- One pair or characters, the 'Alpha Couple' are particularly clearly limned. About 25 songs plus the whole album 'Tallahassee' is about them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VvZWjPSY80<br />

<br />
<big>3) Merge (2009 - Present)</big><br />
<br />
Hard to rigorously explain the change since Heretic Pride. More band-based but simultaneously less direct. 'Power trio'. Less singing, more low-toned narration which it is only slight exaggeration to call sprechgesang.

## Cataloguing

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QqFLv-lOcG6mH4fHovVqXtx4hwyGXoHFj7vnTiUYDuk/edit?usp=sharing

- He has destroyed about 50
- And about 10 have only been played live
- And several exist ambiguously - in title only perhaps
- A new track was found last year on one copy of an early cassette
- And no other copy of that cassette


## Ranking

My album ranking is mostly a function of the constituent songs' ranking. Though some work together to greater effect, like Tallahassee or MCB.

All of these songs can receive a +3 at a given live performance.



> Of course the original signal is never actually anywhere near any recordings anywhere, but you all already knew that. You have been sure of it for quite some time now. You see the proof everywhere. It is the reason you started reading these lines in the first place... Tracking live... You're hearing something which actually happened.



## Psychological realism

There is a whole literary genre, "<a href="http://www.jahsonic.com/PsychologicalNovel.html">psychological realism</a>", for <span style="font-style: italic;">novels</span> which focus on the details of their characters' minds. In them, self-narrative and (usually self-delusion) are more important than <span style="font-style: italic;">plot</span>, <em>truth</em>, <em>denouement</em>: the "actual" events. Does anyone write psychological rock?</p><br />

Well now <em>yes</em>. <i>All Eternals Deck</i> is just that, retaining the perfectly tuned Gothic aesthetic in which the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Psychological_novels">the later psych novels</a> wallowed.  (Note: 'psychedelic' rock is the <em>opposite</em> of what I'm looking for - it's a candy-coloured <i>flight</i> from ordinary inner life.) So<span style="font-style: italic;"> AED</span> isn't just about how frickin cool tarot or black metal is, or how real ghosts are, or any of that: it's about the power of ideas over us. Also our perversity. (To be haunted is to not let a ghost go, and not as we usually say, the converse.)</p><br />
