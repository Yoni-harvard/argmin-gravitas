### 1. The world is all that is the case.

###  2. What is the case is the existence of states of affairs

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>TODO</h3>
	<div>
		2.12 - A picture is a model of reality.<br />
		2.141 - A picture is a fact.<br />
		2.172 - A picture cannot depict its pictorial form: it displays it.<br />
		2.19 - Logical pictures can depict the world.<br />2.223 - In order to tell whether a picture is true or false we must compare it with reality.<br />
		2.224 - It is impossible to tell from the picture alone whether it is true or false.<br />
	</div>
</div>

<br><br>

###  3. A logical picture of facts is a thought.

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>TODO</h3>
	<div>
		3.01 - The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.<br />
		3.1 - In a proposition a thought finds an expression that can be perceived by the senses.<br />
		3.3 - Only propositions have sense; only in the nexus of a proposition does a name have meaning.<br />
		3.332 - No proposition can make a statement about itself, because a propositional sign cannot be contained in itself.  
	</div>
</div>

<br><br>

### 4.  A thought is a proposition with a sense.

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>TODO</h3>
	<div>
		4.003 - Most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not false but nonsensical.<br />
		4.0031 - All philosophy is a 'critique of language'. The apparent logical form of a proposition need not be its real one.<br />
		4.11 - The totality of true propositions is the whole of natural science<br />
		4.461 - Propositions show what they say; tautologies and contradictions show that they say nothing.<br />
		4.464 - A tautology's truth is certain, a proposition's possible, a contradiction's impossible. 
	</div>
</div>

<br><br>

###  5. A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions.

<br>

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>TODO</h3>
	<div>
		5.3 - All propositions are results of truth-operations on elementary propositions.<br />
		5.6 - The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.<br />
		5.61 - We cannot think what we cannot think; so what we cannot think we cannot say either.<br />
		5.621 - The world and life are one.<br />
		5.63 - I am my world. (The microcosm.)<br />
		5.632 - The subject does not belong to the world but it is a limit of the world  <br />
	</div>
</div>





<br><br>

### 6. Truth-functions and propositions have the same general form

	<h3>TODO</h3>
	<div>
		6.13 - Logic is not a body of doctrine, but a mirror-image of the world. Logic is transcendental.<br />
		6.2 - Mathematics is a logical method.<br />
		6.21 - A proposition of mathematics does not express a thought.<br />
		6.41 - The sense of the world must lie outside the world.<br />
		6.431 - At death the world does not alter, but comes to an end.<br />
		6.4311 - Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death.<br />6.44 - It is not how things are in the world that is mystical, but that it exists.

###  7. Whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent.

All the things in these pictures can easily be said: they all fit into a set of propositions (albeit a self-refuting set): it's called <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em>. Drawing is only a kind of saying; the kind of reference that he means by <em>zeigen </em>is less concrete and more important than this.<br>
