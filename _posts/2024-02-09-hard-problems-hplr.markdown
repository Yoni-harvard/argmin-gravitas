We finally published our [big 90-page intro to AI](https://twitter.com/g_leech_/status/1755542850433946107). Its likely effects, from ten perspectives, ten camps. The whole gamut: ML, scientific applications, social applications, access, safety and alignment, economics, AI ethics, governance, and classical philosophy of life. Intended audience: technical people without any ML experience.


We spent a chunk of 2022 and 2023 reviewing [1347 papers](https://t.co/Immcsg2YUq) and talking to [30 experts](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFzn1BrWIAA0FRd?format=jpg&name=large).


We inherited the framing (“Ten Hard Problems”) from Eric Schmidt and James Manyika. They conditionalise on success: "if it's 2050 and everything went well, what did we have to solve for that to happen?":


* HP #1: what general abilities do we need, for good outcomes?


* HP #2: how do we make the things reliable and secure throughout their increasing power and pervasiveness?


* HP #3: If they have goals of their own, how do we make sure they are compatible with ours?


* HP #4: what great object-level technical problems will it help solve?


* HP #5: how will we manage the macroeconomic shock?


* HP #6: Who gets to build it? Who gets to use it? Who gets to benefit?


* HP #7: what social and environmental damage needs to be prevented and mitigated?


* HP #8: how do we coordinate various powerful actors' use of AI?


* HP #9: how does social infrastructure have to adapt? Who, if anyone, will govern it?


* HP #10: what changes in the human condition, after human exceptionalism and after historical materialism?


We put a huge amount of effort into the visualisations, which should make it possible for you to understand a good 30% of the paper's gist in about 3 minutes. Huge thanks to Anekdote Studio DK for making these look so good.
