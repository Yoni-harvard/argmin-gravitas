Cathy O'Neil does a great service in rendering clear the doubly obscure world of big-data modelling. (Doubly: both highly technical and private to corporation's internal code.)

But she doesn't do anything like a cost-benefit account of the practice. She likes FICO, because it had good effects on loans for underrepresented people. It did this by allowing better modelling.




Is Risk Classification Good for Society?

    From a societal perspective, is risk classification desirable?
    Some argue that risk classification should be restricted when
        insurance is mandatory (e.g., auto liability)
        classification is based on inherited traits (e.g., gender, genes)
        classification is based on location of residence (e.g., auto, property)
        classification is based on subjective criteria (e.g., “poor moral risks”)
    Effects of restricting classification
    1.  Redistributes income
        From low risk to high risk
            Is this fair?
    2.  Changes behaviour
        Classification will alter insurance prices to certain groups and therefore change behavior
        Types of behavior:
            amount of insurance purchased
            loss control activities
        Some changes in behavior may be desirable and some undesirable
            amount of liability insurance purchased by poor people
            smoking
            amount of life insurance purchased by people with HIV
    3.  Decreases classification social cost
        Ignoring fairness issues (point #1), if there are no behavioral effects of classification (point #2), then costly classification is a waste;
        i.e. classification simply redistributes income
    4.  Limiting classification may increase regulatory social cost
        Monitoring to enforce restrictions
        Need to impose other costly restrictions on insurers
            marketing activities
            underwriting activities
        Restrictions lead insurers to not offer coverage
        Leads to residual market (involuntary market) mechanisms
        Leads to additional costs
