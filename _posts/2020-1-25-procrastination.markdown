<!-- **The Art of Procrastination: A Guide to Effective Dawdling, Lollygagging & Postponing** by John Perry -->

<blockquote>
	<b>structured procrastinator</b>: a person who gets a lot done by [consciously] not doing other ['important'] things.<br/><br/>
<!--  -->
	...structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self-deception, since one is in effect constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself. Exactly. One needs to be able to recognize and commit oneself to tasks with inflated importance and unreal deadlines, while making oneself feel that they are important and urgent. This is not a problem, because virtually all procrastinators have excellent self-deceptive skills also. And what could be more noble than using one character flaw to offset the bad effects of another?"
</blockquote><br>

Previously, I settled for this. I now want to become the person, to inhabit the environment, that does the thing.

This book didn't exactly change my life, but it made me feel better about what I was already doing. (Before, I'd been calling it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist">slingshot</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia">akrasia</a>.) <br/><br/>

Structured procrastination is that staple from stand-up comedy where the best way to get yourself to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mktCdixReBA">tidy your entire house</a> is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILysMhm8lXs">sit down to do your taxes</a>.<br/><br/>
: All of my reviews, all of my <a href="https://www.gleech.org/">essays</a> were written in the glow and shadow of other things I should've been doing.<br/><br/>

<blockquote>All procrastinators put off things they have to do. Structured procrastination is the art of making this bad trait work for you. The key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing. Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing; they do marginally useful things, such as gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they find the time. Why does the procrastinator do these things? Because accomplishing these tasks is a way of not doing something more important.<br/><br/>
        If all the procrastinator had left to do was to sharpen some pencils, no force on earth could get him to do it. However, the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely, and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important...<br/><br/>
        Doing those tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher on the list. With this sort of appropriate task structure, you can become a useful citizen. Indeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.<br/><br/>
        Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this approach ignores the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be, by definition, the most important. And the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is the way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being...<br/><br/>
        The second step in the art of structured procrastination is to pick the right sorts of projects for the top of the list. The ideal projects have two characteristics -- they seem to have clear deadlines (but really don't), and they seem awfully important (but really aren't). Luckily, life abounds with such tasks. At universities, the vast majority of tasks fall into those two categories, and I'm sure the same is true for most other institutions...<br/><br/>
        At this point, the observant reader may feel that structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self-deception, since one is, in effect, constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself. Exactly... what could be more noble than using one character flaw to offset the effects of another? <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>

Work and study <i>pressurise</i> my life. They give me a structure to defy, a gravity assist. I am happiest laden with obligations, when the set of tasks that is my life flies just out of control. I think the mechanism is this: <br/><br/>
  1. I require a steady stream of variety. <br/>  2. Having a job makes my days closely resemble each other. <br/>  3. Intolerable resentment. <br/>  I am forced to produce creative sparks to satisfy my basic drive. <br/><br/>
SP is related to how great I feel when I don't have to go to a party, to my sadly efficient approach to grades, to how giving work to a busy person is a good way of getting it done quicker, i.e. an implausible linear increase of output with increasing things to do. I read more fiction when doing a stats degree and learn more stats when in work.<br/><br/>

<b>Antecedents of Perry and me.</b><br/><br/>
Fernando Pessoa: 
<blockquote>        I often wonder what kind of person I would be if I had been protected from the cold wind of fate by the screen of wealth... to reach the tawdry heights of being a good assistant book-keeper in a job that is about as demanding as an afternoon nap and offers a salary that gives me just enough to live on.<br/>        I know that, had that past existed, I would not now be capable of writing these pages, which, though few, I would undoubtedly have only day-dreamed, given more comfortable circumstances. For banality is a form of intelligence, and reality, especially if it is brutish and rough, forms a natural complement to the soul. Much of what I feel and think I owe to my work as a book-keeper since the former exists as a negation of and flight from the latter. <br/></blockquote>
<br/><br/>
Nietzsche: 
<blockquote>        the struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity... produced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely-strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals... we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow! And perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who knows? The goal to aim at... <br/></blockquote>
<br/><br/>
Geoff Dyer:
<blockquote>        The best circumstance for writing, I realized... were those in which the world was constantly knocking at your door; in such circumstances, the work you were engaged in generated a kind of pressure, a force to keep the world at bay. Whereas here, on Alonissos, there was nothing to keep at bay, there was no incentive to generate any pressure within the work, and so the surrounding emptiness invaded and dissipated, overwhelmed you with inertia. All you could do was look at the sea and the sky and after a couple of days you could scarcely be bothered to do that.<br/></blockquote>
<br/><br/>
Zach Weiner: 
<blockquote>        [After months of working only on my main goal] I took on a job doing closed captioning because I found it [made for] an easier time writing. Just something about talking to people and watching weird media made the writing a lot easier. My new theory of self was that you can't write well unless you have a little strife in your life. I worked at the closed captioning job for 4-6 months and by then I was making enough money on the site to responsibly quit my job.<br/><br/>
        The problem was I didn't want to quit my job and have readership fall off because I couldn't write, so my crazy idea was to go back to school. I thought, it'd to be this weird environment, with younger people, and that would be good...<br/></blockquote>

Is this platitudinous? It is possible that the grand narration above is delusional, and that the only actual content here is "A lot of people work better under pressure". Don't think so though.<br/><br/>

YMMV. 5/5 if you don't do this already

		Another way I am ruled by demons: I have rarely had a shock of recognition stronger than when I read the above. The one says: "Let's go to that thing! Let's put on trousers, let's brave the night air, let's endure the tube, let's chat and schmooze."
<!--  -->
		You go along with it, screw up your courage, walk down the road - and find the Tube line closed! <br><br>
<!--  -->
		The other says: "Joy of joys! - life pouring in rivulets down my chin! I am master of time, unto me is life extension: you, you beautiful infrastructure, have raised me from the dead and set me high."<br><br>
<!--  -->
		It doesn't work if <i>you</i> cancel. The game is not that easy. Instead, you must be actually prevented, or the other must cancel.
