Giant claims in this class
implicit: you should be fixing what's missing in the world 

most smart people don't change the world
<2% of parents are great at parenting

"define smart people by iq > 130"
"iq kinda sucks"

corporations, academia, NGOs, Art, EA and modern startups are ladders people climb and waste 40 years of their lives on 

the vast majority of papers are useless, even to their authors
same for most books, patents(?), art(?)

academics sacrifice their vision for tenure and hope to do better later but don't because the 7-year grind changes you 

antiwork is also a ladder

you can goodhart the IMO by memorizing proofs

startups 1990s-2000s did involve small groups of very weird people changing the world, but the window for startups is closing

The Knowledge Society which teaches kids to make fake startups is literally satanic 

The Efficient Market Hypothesis is trivially false for intellectual work 

ESPR instructor saved ??lives by optimizing a central Google process and thinks it's the most valuable thing he's done 

"you don't need credentials"
"you don't need a hero license"

Who here has a clear idea of what they want from life?
Who here has a clear idea of how to get it?
Jokes

a fatal trap that lies in wait for the brilliant but unwary young person: success
    ; other people’s definitions of success

This class is a polemic.
I make a number of extremely large claims. Feel free to challenge them, we have time
Some of this class is based on personal experiences you can't verify. Various sociologists agree with me

What do we mean by success
“Excellence”: Ordinary success. Pejorative. Default.
money, status, fame
Ivy League degree, fancy title, proximity to power 
“Greatness”. 
Doing something no one has ever done before. 
Self-fulfilment
whatever you want including all of the above

You cannot allow other people to decide what you want from life.
This is the most likely single thing to ruin your life. 
Doing the wrong thing reduces your effective lifespan by 40 years: your career
This includes me. All of the following is conditional on what you want in life. 


1. What do you want in life? (5 mins)
While you’re thinking I will list some examples. 
Scientific discovery, art, parenting, happiness, freedom, chill, Enlightenment, fun, safety, doing something genuinely new, retiring early, saving the world, varietymaxxing


Breakout, share



2. What’s missing in the world? (3 mins)
Same question with a different centre of gravity
Breakout, share


3. What is stopping you?
Solicit

Parents
Skill
School
Poverty.
Lack of self-knowledge
Miscalibration about how much skill you need
Lack of connections
Credentials. “Job requirements”
Team 
Ideas
Audience
Excellence trap
Youth
Courage. “Permission”

The Excellence trap
Most smart people do not change the world much. EXTREMELY SKETCHY ARGUMENT NONLITERAL AND NONROBUST NUMBERS JUST TO GIVE SOME INTUITION

IQ is overrated but say for the purposes just of this argument that “smart” is 130+
There are 182m people in that set
Claim: There are not 182m great works a year / a decade
5m academic papers published a year
1m books a year
Patents suck but 647k a year
Roughly 1 billion parents. Probably 10 million great ones if we’re honest

Why?
They get trapped in excellence. Climb ladders.

Fundamental reason that these places lead you away from: 
Organisations are complex. Internal politics. Most of the org is not at the coalface, getting real feedback
Proxy objective optimised hard enough. not the true objective. Metric gap
Moral Mazes

Corporate ladder - L7 ($1m a year), C-level, first class flights, PA, suits
Government ladder
Academia ladder - how many of you know how tenure works?
Nonprofit ladder - grand speeches and unbelievable inefficiency
Fine art ladder - 
Startup ladder - TKS
EA ladder

(There's also [a ladder](https://ranprieur.com/essays/dropout.html) for radical off-grid dropouts)


The reasons that old institutions so often end up doing unoriginal and fake things are deep and interesting but for a later session.

Hero licence
Ignorance of the option set
Miscalibration about skill requirements
Missing self-image

Another thing that stops people is not realising that you can just do things. You don’t need permission, you usually don’t need a credential, you don’t need to solve all your personal problems first

I’m the first person in my family to go to college. Grandparents all farmers. Mother a cleaner.
I was also shy and depressed for a lot of the first 20 years.
It took me a while to get going. 

Several times in my life, people have tapped me on the shoulder and told me that I wasn’t living up to my potential.

I was working in London finance, doing “very well”, not working very hard. But the work was meaningless and the corporation I inhabited was extremely dysfunctional. I told a researcher I met that I didn’t think I was good enough to do a PhD. He scoffed and said that I was obviously far above median.
A bit later, I was a researcher, I was in a PhD. But no one was really paying any attention. I sent a famous public intellectual my work. He sent me $30,000 and promoted my work to millions of people. This led to me starting my company, working on incredibly fun things all the time, and never worrying about money ever again.
At the same time, I didn’t have a circle. I had friends but no collaborators, no one who cared about the things I cared about, no one pushing me to do concrete better work. I didn’t think of myself as a leader. I went to Czechia and met this crazy bunch of researchers and meditators and programmers. It was one of the most fun weeks of my life. Some time later, they asked me to lead this camp for teenagers they run.

I was waiting for permission and was deluded about how much it takes to be great, to do actually new things. 

My hope is that this class is the last tap on the shoulder you need.




EMH
Economists walking down the street and see $20 on the sidewalk. “Ignore it” one says, “if it was real someone would already have picked it up”. The dollar bills are life-changing ideas

Feb 2020 Covid, some of the ESPR instructors spotted things that weren’t going to get done. No background, no credentials. 
I’ve published well in psychology and epidemiology and linguistics. I’ve never taken a class in these or read a textbook in them. Just ain’t that hard.
I’ve advised the UK government 3 times on topics

Who knows what a monotile is?
We have the first safe and effective obesity treatment since 2021.
We discovered that multiple sclerosis is caused by Epstein-Barr
Brain-spine interface
Mars is geologically active. It has volcanoes

Startup. Noticing something about the domain. Also speed
OpenAI was initially nine people
Wise

First CRISPR gene therapy
Per Enflo (80!!) INVARIANT SUBSPACE PROBLEM IN HILBERT SPACES

The world is too high-dimensional to be explored easily, for EMH to apply.


Ways to identify fake ambition
Sometimes it’s hard to tell if you authentically want something, or are trying to impress people with how ambitious you are. Here are a few tricks I’ve picked up for distinguishing them.
What do you feel when you think about shrinking the project?
Anger, fear, or disappointment that the goal won’t be accomplished = seems like you care a lot, good sign for the project. 
Relief = project seems like a lot of work. Consider if you’re up for that level of work before beginning (but the answer might be yes).
Fear of failure = this is a terrible sign, unless you have some reason the smaller version is more likely to fail (if you do, try the question again with a version that is easier and more likely to succeed). If failure feels like a bigger threat for a project that is objectively easier, that’s a suggestion you are, on some level, not taking the big version seriously. If you were, it would be scarier.
Fear of other people’s reaction = your primary motivation here is probably social. Knowing that, do you still want to go forward? The answer can be yes, although if so I hope the project is cheap.
If you fail, will you or the people around you go “well what did you expect?” That would suggest your goal is unachievable from your current state.
Another reason smaller projects can be scarier is that people will judge you more for failing. Don’t let this push you into too-big projects.
If you fail, will it be educational? “No” is both a sign the project is too big (because you don’t understand it well enough) and a reason the project is too big (you’re going to pour all that energy in and not even get learning out?)
How does concrete, accurate, actionable criticism make you feel? 
If it’s a real goal you should be delighted, because feedback helps you reach that goal faster. Or if you’re a little less evolved, not delighted, but at least it feels like a really productive massage or workout, where it hurts but you can tell it will be worth it. If you feel terrified, or angry, or especially unsupported, that suggests you care more about the social aspect of the project than its outcome.
Does the project give you a satisfying feeling of contact with reality? That’s maybe a sign it’s a real goal, and definitely good in general.
What does “contact with reality” mean? That is a very reasonable question I don’t have a good answer for, at least not in words. Hopefully you’ll know it when you see it.


5. What's stopping you? (5mins)
Self-knowledge? Courage? Permission? Team? Skill? Audience? X?

Hopefully ESPR will solve the first four for you

 Most “job requirements” are nonsense. No legal force, just there to attempt to increase the pool quality.
5. After that is relaxed, what's stopping you (1min)
6. After that is relaxed, what's stopping you (1min)


7. What can ESPR do for you? What can you do for the above this week? (5 mins)
help finding who to contact (profs, founders, anons)
help writing cold emails
help starting a blog and plugging it
help calibrating ambition level correctly (usually up)
help finding funding
help developing mastery (maths, forecasting, public speaking, whatev)
scholarships
detailed research feedback
finding collaborators

You fail this class if you do not ask for something

Damage control
One thing you might take away from this class is that you need to do bigger things, put even more pressure on yourself. No! I am telling you that you have that option, you are more powerful than you think.
Ladders are useful. Most useful work takes place inside them, despite them. You can't scale without a ladder
To attain self-fulfilment, others must comply 

Do not let me tell you what to do.

Most work makes the world better in a small and quiet way. This is a beautiful thing. Mihaly once worked on Google’s central TCP/IP code. He commented out one line and sped up every single web request that Google performs. A quadrillion of milliseconds saved every day = 11 years of human life every year. He says this is likely the most valuable work he ever did.

Getting to L6 at Google, having 2 children, saying true things, retiring at 50, being kind. This is a lot. It is more than most humans who ever lived achieved 









What do you want in life
What needs fixing
What's stopping you
After that is relaxed, what's stopping you
…
What are your next 3 steps


Create hard things
Find your coterie
Ask people without shame

On rails
You go where they say, do the assignments they say, when they say, and doing well means meeting the goals they set for you. You get choices in your leisure activity, but leisure is unimportant
Then you get further in school, and the authorities give you some choice over the hoops you jump through. You can choose which book you write your report on or even what classes you take (within a predetermined set). This feels like freedom, but you’re in still a system someone else designed and set the win conditions for. You can fulfill a college distribution requirement with any history class at all- but you are going to take one, and the professor is the one determining if you succeeded at it. 
you’ll like it. Creating your own definition of success feels scary; enacting it feels impossible. 


Quadrants


I could fill in the bottom half but it’s irrelevant to the people in this class

4. Are you the right amount of ambitious? (2mins)
I cannot tell you “be more ambitious”. It’s a tightrope with terrible waste on either extreme. 



rails, inauthenticity, fakery, waste                resources, pretension, stress, waste

The golden median is different for each of you. One of the chief tasks of your life is finding it.



Mathematics is one of the least fake things in the world. But you still see the trap there. 
People memorise proofs and names and trade off against understanding. 
Reading too much is dangerous past a certain point. IMO “oh apply Cauchy-Schwartz”
