A thought-experiment that shows a problem with naive utilitarianism:

> Harry and Tom are soldiers on their way back from a mission deep in enemy territory, out of ammunition - when Tom steps in a trap set by the enemy. His leg is badly injured and caught in the trap. Harry cannot free him from this trap without killing him. However, if Harry leaves Tom behind, the enemy troops will find him and torture him to death. Tom begs Harry not to leave him behind to be cruelly tortured to death. The enemy troops are closing in on their position and it is not safe for Harry or his men to remain with the trapped comrade any longer... <br><br> Tom pleads to Harry: "Please, don't kill me. I don't want to die out here in the field"<br><br> Should Harry stab Tom in the heart to prevent his suffering at the hands of the enemy?

(modified from 'The Soldier's Dilemma' <a href="{{crockett}}">here</a>.)<br><br>


The point of it is: doesn't hedonic utilitarianism ignore consent in a perverse way? 

Two strong reasons it doesn't: <br>

1. we really shouldn't have much confidence that our moral theory is the right one - and this implies giving some weight to other theories, particularly when they strongly conflict with yours. And this is enough to not kill Tom. 

2. even on the object level, consent is very important to a hedonic utilitarian: it is the only strong, granular evidence we have about <a href="{{val}}">valence</a>. And this is also enough to not kill Tom.

<br>

I'll elaborate on that, but first some other answers:<br><br>


#### 1. Appeal to downstream harm

A weak response is that you'll make utilitarianism look really bad if it gets out. But we can stipulate this away in a thought-experiment.

(Anyway, people are really good at making viewpoints they don't like look bad, even without actual cases.)

<br>

#### 2. The Millian patch

John Stuart Mill's version is one of the most liveable forms of utilitarianism because it adds <a href="{{harm}}">a second principle</a> to pre-empt this kind of thing:

> The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.

<br>

#### 3. Rule utilitarianism

Maybe the rule "don't kill people against their will" is more than good enough to balance out the disutility of one painful death. It pretty plausibly is, but the question is, does the "mercy killing" weaken that rule in any way here?

<br>

#### 4. Preference utilitarianism

That consent is ignored by naive act hedonism is a main selling point of 'preference utilitarianism', the kind that maximises satisfied goals rather than raw feels. This is fine but is not an answer to the thought-experiment. 

(Note that the main proponent of this view <a href="{{singer}}">has switched</a> to the hedonic view because of different edge cases.)

<br>

#### 5. Massive uncertainty

Those 4 responses are all very well if we assume the theory, but I think the real answer to this (and in fact the answer to whole classes of niggling moral edge-cases) is less presumptuous:
<br><br>

#### _Moral uncertainty_ (about the right ethical theory)

We just aren't sure enough of hedonic utilitarianism to act in ways which contravene other moral intutitions as much as this case demands. The details of moral uncertainty are <a href="{{parl}}">still being worked out</a>, but the general lesson is to <a href="{{hedge}}">hedge</a> (pick things that accord with all good theories), and to trade with people who have different ethics. <br><br>

plus<br><br>

#### _Intersubjective uncertainty_ (about the value of others' experiences)

Self-report (and its subset, consent) is currently _overwhelmingly_ the strongest evidence we have for the wellbeing of others.

The only hard reason I have to generalise my own situation-valence pairs to others is the deep similarities of our brains. But we know that people with quite similar brains can still have astonishing variance in preferences - witness kink, or addiction, or free soloing.

We know too little about suffering to act drastically according to merely intuitive external judgments of experience quality. 

Even if it seems obvious that the physical pain of the dying man outweighs the satisfaction he gets from having his wishes respected, I don't have anything like warrant to act. Whether the benefit to him is pride in defying suffering, or in the <a href="{{halluc}}">deeply altered</a> <a href="{{dmt}}">states</a> involved is moot: absent deception, it is overwhelming evidence.

My claim is that we don't even know the _sign_ of another person's valence, without their honest report.

(This might change a bit when welfare biology advances, giving us another source of evidence about the value of a state, but will never be countermanded unless we discover some <a href="{{pearce}}">far-out materialist theory</a> that lets us empirically measure the value of a conscious state.)

<br>

<div class="accordion">
    <h3>Subjective uncertainty</h3>
    <div>
		One possible counterargument to the above is that, as well as me being uncertain, the victim <i>themselves</i> could be mistaken about what is best for their subjective wellbeing!<br><br>
<!--  -->
		How does this work? You cannot be mistaken about being in pain, for instance. But you can be mistaken about other apparently intimate facts: for instance, <a href="{{arousal}}">being attracted to someone</a> (when actually you are only scared - physical arousal is hard to disambiguate).<br><br>
<!--  -->
		<a href="{{benatar}}">David Benatar</a> argues an extreme version of this, that people are in fact much less happy than they honestly report, because of an adaptive "optimism bias", selected to make us resist suicide.<br><br>
<!--  -->
		I don't know what to make of this - it reminds me of <a href="{{frankish}}">illusionism</a> about consciousness, another cool position I literally cannot imagine being true - but all we need is to accept that the sufferer of a wound knows more about its intrinsic disvalue than I do.
