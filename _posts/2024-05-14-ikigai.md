- the way to make existence really bearable is to act as part of something bigger than you
- Beyond individual self-expression and individual preference satisfaction
    - For all the evils of political activity, this is one thing it really does give people.
        - > Collective self-expression is what was politics. You express your unity with people by surrendering yourself up to it.
