Peter Norvig lists five programming paradigms to learn, divided by their most distinctive forms of abstraction. This is good advice and well-conceptualised. 

But these are hard to understand unless you already know them.

Two rephrasings to make this all fit under the abstraction banner:

* Declarative programming is implementation abstraction: you are instructing an engine to build a program for you that meets this spec.
* Parallelism is processor abstraction: split this task. 


no abstraction. (binary machine code)
statement abstraction (Assembly)
procedural abstraction (Assembly)
data abstraction (FORTRAN)

class abstraction (C#) 
functional abstraction (Haskell)
<li>For type abstraction (Python)*</li><br>
syntactic abstraction (Scheme) 
implementation abstraction (Prolog)
processor abstraction (Go)


<br><br>
* An extremely leaky abstraction, yes, but it's a leaky example of how it could work.
