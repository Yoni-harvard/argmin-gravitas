Some ways we might fail to be moral

* viciousness: intentionally failing by some moral standard
* akrasia: wanting to be moral but failing because of willpower 
* apathy: Not even trying
* moral error: wanting to be moral, and trying, but failing because of lack of knowledge (empirical or normative)
* philosophical moral nihilism: "there are no moral properties to make actions succeed"
* psychological moral nihilism: "people don't have any moral intentions". Trying, but seemingly moral actions are actually disguised egoism.

The last two are the grandest problems and discussion of them isn't centralised. Fault in ontology, or a fault in fundamental psychology.


## Metaethical nihilism

It might be that there are no moral properties: "we all always fail to be moral, because there is no way to succeed". Ontology

## Descriptive egoism

And/or it might be that people don't have moral intentions, despite appearances.

(called "psychological egoism" in the literature, but this is a bad name: it connotes a subjective absence of altruism intentions, which is straightforwardly false.)

### Soares' Stamp Collector thought experiment (which is psychologically very convincing)


### Egoism makes good predictions

sure, but you have unsatisfactory ontology: we want altruism/egoism dichotomy to distinguish certain classes of behavior which are useful; we don't really care about "true motives".


e.g. microeconomics


<!-- My best guess for why egoism is so convincing is that it makes good predictions. I think the best example is various micro-economics models, which assume self-interest (utility maximization) among other unrealistic assumptions. -->

### Evolutionary argument

<!-- I don't know. I think it might be because evolution "pushed" us towards convergent instrumental subgoals. And these are well described with sort of utility maximization/egoism (as they aren't very altruistic and are somewhat easy to measure/conceptualize). -->

<!-- I don't know enough of evolution (and doubt it could be proved for humans) that convergent subgoals come first. But maybe there is room for computational experiments? -->

<!-- Toon Against value drift -->
My confidence is almost atheoretical: there are just (a small number of) people whose actions are very difficult to reconcile with stamp-collector-register logic, e.g. Irena Sendler or many people who resisted their local social incentives and were killed for it. (Limited to atheists for the purposes of a clean counterargument.)

<!-- Misha -->
<!-- I think one can also try street epistemology tools: what would convince/update you that humans act altruistically sometimes?

But in general it hard to disprove because values/optimization is quite flexible. But it is doubtful evolution didn't add anything but self-interest (e.g. self-sacrifice for enough family members e.g. kids).

I think of stamp-collector-register as a counter-argument to the simplistic and mechanical explanations of human behavior. I can imagine that one can say: "oh, she has a counter for the number of saved children". I think reacting to social incentives/maximizing these is a separate (much more specific) issue.

Stamps = it is useful to think about humans as if they are mechanistically optimizing some pre-programmed thingies.
Incentives = it is useful to think about humans as if they are optimizing these specific social thingies. -->
<!-- Both are occasionally useful; both are wrong if taken to extremes. Stamp collector is unsatisfactory because it is too broad and requires building towers of weird exceptions. -->


Ethical egoism is different again: the idea that it is moral to not be altruistic.
