## Writing

I'm open to the idea that pen n paper are superior to typing, for _learning_. 

* But I stick everything in [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/). Nested lists, LaTeX, PDFs, images and videos, all in one doc.

<div class="accordion">
    <h3>e.g.</h3>
    <div>
		<img src="/img/roam.png" /><br>
	</div>
</div><br>

* I am no longer sure if it's worth learning LaTeX, but if you want to or have to, for the love of god use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Saves hours a year on install headaches.
* Years and years in, I still sometimes encounter symbols I don't know the name for. [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) has saved me many hours
* [MathPix](https://mathpix.com) is an AI maths recogniser, so you can go from e.g. handwritten notes to Latex. Very good accuracy, though the formatting often needs cleaning up.

<br>

## Computer algebra ("solve this for me")

* <a href="{{w}}">WolframAlpha</a>. Obvs! Pro is worthwhile for absolute beginners, gives you infinite stepped examples.
* <a href="{{max}}">Maxima</a>. If you need something heavier and free. I see no point in Mathematica or SAGE or even Octave.
* <a href="{{py}}">SymPy</a>. Satisfying but not productive. Only if you're 10x stronger at programming than maths, as I was.
* I'm surprised there's no product of <a href="{{charton}}">this</a> yet (neural net beats Mathematica on univariable integration)

<br>

## References

* I've probably spent more time on <a href="{{mo}}">MathOverflow</a> than I have in textbooks. 
* <a href="{{approach}}">Search engine for formulae</a>. Wolfram does this a bit too.
* <a href="{{g}}">Catalogue of groups</a>
* <a href="{{gr}}">Catalogue of graphs</a>
* <a href="{{cat}}">Catalogue of categories</a>
* I've never actually used <a href="{{i}}">OEIS</a> but some people seem to get real life use out of it.
* <a href="{{open}}">Currently open problems ranked by importance</a>

<br>

## Viz

* [draw.io](https://draw.io/) is way better than it looks. You can easily make publication-quality vector graphics. The good bits of Powerpoint.
* Loads of graphing tools at Desmos (e.g. teaching <a href="{{des}}">linear programming</a> in 2 variables). Amazing to play with transformations and dumb visual optimisation of illustrative curves.
* [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) looks fine too
* Never used either, but for generating beautiful video with a lot of work you now have <a href="{{box}}">MathBox</a> and <a href="{{man}}">Manim</a>

<br>

## Challenges

* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is the second best way to learn a new programming language (once you know one deeply). Some people do way better at the computational than the analytic, and this is one bridge you can take.

<br>


## Courses

I have only ever liked and finished one MOOC (and in general I dislike learning from video). 

* But people seem to love <a href="{{mit}}">OpenCourseWare</a>.
