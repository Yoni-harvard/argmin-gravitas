But in rock music a little rigour is rather bracing and galvanizing. Too much is plain rigid, but Gang of Four hit just the right balance. In the grand tradition of British art-rock, theory helped them achieve the sort of conceptual breakthroughs that more organically evolving groups never reach.

On launch, _Disco Elysium_ presents you with <a href="/img/discoskill.webp">24 bizarre skills</a>, half of which you can't even vaguely understand. The script is about <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/disco-elysium-script-length-one-million-words/">2000</a> pages long. <!-- The soundtrack screeches at you.--> In a real sense it took <a href="https://www.articy.com/en/showcase/disco-elysium/">19 years</a> to make. The branching factor on most conversations is well above 1.

<img src="/img/DiscoElysium_Articy_Flow_HangedMan.jpg" />
<br><center><small>Now imagine 10,000 screens like this</small></center>
<br>

You _could_ reconstruct its <a href="http://fayde.co.uk/search?query=sorry&WordBoundaries=0&actor1=&actor2=&VariableSearch=0&commit=Search">great and vast dialogue tree</a> in a mere novel... if you printed dozens of choose-your-own adventure paper books with thousands of post-its inside. So, excessive.

<!-- > Cuno... was rewritten 20 different times, thanks to the input of multiple perspectives -->


It is a _point and click whodunnit with an amnesic protagonist_, for fuck's sake! Yet another lesson, if you needed one, that there is no genre so overdone, no trope too passé, that a great artist cannot wring more out of. In art, nothing is ruined, nothing is useless, nothing is meaningless. (One reason it can never be realistic.) So, revitalising.

It's far more politically sophisticated than most books. I call it political fiction because it depicts the emotional and structural detail of several wildly different worldviews so well, better than anything since <i>Red Plenty</i> (2010). They made something [smarter than themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1gKGq44NxQ). This can happen. It is memeable, and ripe for the dirtbag left (see the [dubious Chapo](https://www.vg247.com/how-the-last-living-soviet-video-game-developers-recruited-chapo-trap-house-for-disco-elysium) voiceovers in the original cut). But it is less simple than that, you have to work to make it that simple, ignore 90% of the game. The game resists compression. I could spend another couple dozen hours noticing things and making up themes. Redemption – isn't everyone's first playthrough the redemption arc? – is only the simplest and most obvious route through. 

How did they make the best RPG ever? Well, spending 18 years on it must've helped. Returning to the opening Reynolds line, I also want to say that their post-marxism is a long difficult ladder which let them into virgin areas of game narrative and of course provided a rich layer of historical tragedy over everything else in the game. The truth or usefulness of theory isn't the main thing when you're making art. This is the _latent_ function of critical theory: making people make interesting art, by removing certain preconceptions and instilling new ones. So, an elevating false framework.


That the game is also actually existentialist and an amazing portrait of multi-agent mind and <a href="{{greek}}">a Greek tragedy</a> and a work of science fiction which justifies <a href="{{slip}}">an obtuse synonym</a> and bedecked in Lucian Freud visuals and shimmery post-rock ambience is just icing. 

<br>

People wrongly call this sort of thing 'pretentious', because people don't get that pretension is about _pretence_: pretending to be deeper than you are. Being abstruse is something else. It's melancholy but not self-pitying and not life-denying. It's cynical but not sneering and not unkind. The grail.
<!-- Its misanthropy is pretty toothless – we are just 'evil apes'.  -->

Subcultures and archetypes it depicts perfectly: cops, drugs, organic racism, theoretical racism, rave philosophers, locker room nastiness, bureaucrats, petit bourgeois, haute bourgeois, realpolitik operators, depressed leftists, and the various kinds of <a href="{{temp}}">revolutionary</a>. They don't do quite as well on fascism or neoliberalism or centrism. But still more accurate and thoughtful than almost any radicals.

            <i>on this level of collaboration it just feels wrong to take ownership because because, the way the writing process worked - at least back when we started with this game - is that everyone started out with a character or a scene, wrote it to a certain extent, then other people whose characters or scenes interact with it came and wrote another layer on top. Then there was an editing layer - maybe sometimes even after that we went back to the drawing board. For example I think I rewrote Cuno like 20 times... part of why the game feels so like textured and lived-in is because like there are probably still parts of that [draft] Cuno in there somewhere - part of why it feels so surreal is that it is layered in that way... It taught us all a little bit about how small we really are.

<br><br>


some themes I've spotted so far:  

<br><br>



### The political is personal

It's roughly correct to locate the origins and energy of fascism in personal grievance, gut feelings about purity, and nostalgia. But so too for communism and wishful thinking, magical thinking, impulsivity, fatigue, and resentment. 

> You: If communism keeps failing every time we try it...<br>
Steban: (he waits patiently for you to finish)<br>
You: ...And the rest of the world keep killing us for our beliefs...<br>
Steban: Yes?<br>
Volition: Say it.<br>
You: ...What's the point?<br>
Steban: (he considers your words for a minute)<br>
Composure: You're witnessing his ironic armour melt before you. This is his *true self* you're seeing now.<br>
Empathy: He's thinking about someone...<br>
You: Wait, who is he thinking about?<br>
Empathy: Hard to say. Someone dear to him.<br>


Love [stands](http://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/5240035) as a metaphor for communism in several places. Both are the struggle which always fails. Breakups are reactionary, failed revolutions. People have done such terrible things in the name of each:

> Real darkness has love for a face.



_Hatred as one of the main political emotions_. The old monarchist Rene and the political commissar Dros are the same in an important sense: desensitized, unmoored from sympathy. The desensitization of one is organic (rooted in nostalgia) and theoretical in the other (rooted in the totalising kind of marxism). (This chasm between the organic and the theoretical is another theme I should develop. You have the ordinary racists and then Measurehead, Psuedoscientist. You have the familial quasi-socialism of Titus Hardie vs the terrifying abstractions of the Deserter.)
<!-- KHTK are deeply, over-the-top political, but they satirise their own.  -->

One obvious absurd example: Harry calls his ex Dora a war criminal and identifies her with a mythical Europa figure (who I can't quite place. Justice?) Harry's enormous pain is hysteroid dysphoria from a bad breakup, PTSD from 20 years of hard policing and terrible acts, brain damage from [sticking his head into a radioactive singularity](http://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/11050788-11050925#11050925), and only fourthly the social pain of an undemocratic life, a humiliated populace, poverty, and a lost utopia. But give him any chance and he will attribute his problems to the Coalition and the war.



<br><br>


### The personal is not political

You can internalise Marxism-Leninism and spout about it in nearly every conversation – and this doesn't constrain your behaviour at all. You still wear whatever, lech, shoot people whenever, [go work at Wild Pines](https://twitter.com/NikVenkatesh/status/1629082923906244608?s=20).

You can max out communism, fascism, neoliberalism, and bureaucrat humanism, at nearly the same time. You can be an actual Nazi feminist. 

The game's revealed stance is: politics is primarily talk. Because politics is about your gang against the other gang, and talk is the way you pledge yourself.

<!-- Not all bad things are the same thing, and people are rarely good on every topic. -->

> In Disco Elysium the world is quickly being destroyed by a supernatural substance known as the "pale": they don't know how much time they have left, but it's on the order of a few decades. Everyone goes on with their petty squabbles regardless. The more I think about it, it seems like less of a fantasy and more of a mirror. How long until the last generation?

### ideologies as parasitic monsters


> The furies are at home<br>in the mirror; it is their address.<br>Even the clearest water,<br>if deep enough can drown.<br><br>Never think to surprise them.<br>
Your face approaching ever<br>
so friendly is the white flag<br>
they ignore. There is no truce<br><br>
with the furies. A mirror’s temperature<br>
is always at zero. It is ice<br>
in the veins. Its camera<br>
is an X-ray. It is a chalice<br><br>held out to you in<br>silent communion, where gaspingly<br>you partake of a shifting<br>
identity never your own.<br>

– RS Thomas

<br>

You might think you've been to some pretty strange corners of the internet. "[Egregore](https://www.weirdstudies.com/36)" is a word used in the strange corners beyond the strange corners of the internet, in treating ideologies as as-if demonic adaptive predators who need human hosts and enforcers to live and breed.

The remarkable thing is that KHTK can depict humanity's prey relationship to ideology _while still enthusiastically submitting to one_. (It is one thing to be a young communist in Britain, where the parties were tiny and their evils limited to toadyism and ruining a [few dozen lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Healy) through sexual abuse. It is quite mad to be a young communist in Estonia, where everyone's grandparents still remember someone they shot. The "Last Living Soviet Video Game Developers".)


<br><br>

### Gettier superstitions

> We're big fans of Émile Zola but if there's one thing he leaves out, it’s the supernatural. we live in a world where, even in the C21st we don't really understand what's happening... I think in order to truly represent life realistically, you have to have a complete unknown.

<center>– <a href="{{inverse}}">Helen Hindpere</a></center>

<br>


An irony which crops up repeatedly is that _the cranks are right_, for the wrong reasons. Plaisance is right about the Presence (the phasmid; the hole in the world; the Pale). The cryptozoologist Morrell is right about the phasmid. Harry is constantly right on wild hunches. You're not safe just because you're careful and modest and sceptical.

<br><br>

### Chaos as ladder

KHTK are not idiots. They know that monsters usually abuse the revolution, take over the Party - and that even good people get completely poisoned by ideology. Besides the Templar deserter, the Claires represent this process (though they don't seem to be the fully insincere sort of monster). 

To my surprise _DE_ depicts the union as extremely ambiguous. (One of your first interactions with it is to see that a giant giga-racist is their bouncer.) In contrast, they give the Wild Pines corporation the extremely sympathetic and genre-savvy Joyce. 

(It's a bit crazy for a critique of ideology to come from avowed (Euro) communists in a country devastated by actually-existing (imperialist) communism, but they are real artists, they can make things larger than themselves.)


<br><br>

### Ambivalence towards art and work

The script has some contempt for the rave babblers and the idiot edginess of the Skulls. People who mistake artistic shock for a political statement. (TODO: write about how the idiot ravers are actually the heart of the story, the titular theme, living inside liberalism's ruins, hedonistic but wise.)

The developers are represented throughout the game. The failure of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160517101025/http://devblog.fortressoccident.com/">Fortress Accident</a> is their fear for their own fate. 

> YOU: Are there people in there?<br>SHIVERS – Yes, [ZA/UM] hard at work at their desks. They can barely tell if it's day or night anymore because the lights in the building are so uniform and bright. Who knows when they'll come out?<br>YOU – What keeps them motivated?<br>SHIVERS – Irony. They're yuppies masquerading as Mazovians... Or was it Mazovians masquerading as yuppies? Even they get confused sometimes...


Quite scary: even marxists as sophisticated as KHTK have still internalised the idea that work is bad, even creative work, and that hard work is stupid. A million miles from Marx.

They obviously worked their arses off though. So I wonder if this negativity about their project is a rare moment of pandering, or just an incoherent little piece of slacktivism.

> It's a small price to pay, a single human life, a little heart attack to make the greatest CRPG the world has ever seen! We are Eastern Europeans. <b>We need to make best computer RPG made!</b>"

<center>–<a href="{{rpg}}"> Kurvitz</a></center>

<br>

### The golden hammer

Your character state includes

* Your overall archetype (Intellectual, Psyche, Motorics, Physique)
* Your political ideologies (nonexclusive)
* Your identity projects and Idees fixes (Thought Cabinet)
* Your skills, 24 [subpersonalities](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/iCfdcxiyr2Kj8m8mT/the-shard-theory-of-human-values) 

The archetypes are four totally different ways of playing: abstraction vs intuition and emotion vs aggression vs "Motorics" (sensitivity, stream entry, embodiment, integration). 

What you're good at determines your decisions (represented by the game rolling checks for you).

> At high levels, Hand/Eye Coordination makes you deadly – supposing you’ve a weapon in your hand. But once you do, Hand/Eye Coordination will compel you to take the shot – even if it’s not the best approach.

<br>

### Umwelt, flashes, shivers, orbs, multiagent mind.

Playing as Harry gives us a remarkable portrait of the bundle of impressions, hallucinations, hunches, scherzos that forms a sensitive person on an average day.


> "It would be unbelievable [cool] to use our skill system to speak about the bodily sensations of having another organism inside of you, while you're in the setting and talking to another person."

<br><br>

### Europe. 

> Joy, the beautiful spark of divinity,<br>
Daughter of Elysium,<br>
We enter, drunk with fire,<br>
Heavenly one, thy sanctuary!<br>
Thy magic binds again<br>
What custom strictly divided;<br>
All men become brothers<br>
Where thy gentle wing rests.<br><br>
Be embraced, you millions!<br>
This kiss to all the world!<br>
Brothers, above the starry canopy<br>
There <b>must</b> dwell a loving Father.<br>
Are you collapsing, you millions?<br>
Do you sense the creator?<br>
Seek him above the starry canopy!<br>
Above the stars he must dwell.

– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem_of_Europe">Euro</a>
<br><br>


It's very European - the writers steal stereotypes and words from all over the place, but smear them. Revachol is Paris 1871, Berlin 1946, East Berlin 1975, Haiti forever, Tallinn 1999, New Orleans 2005. No one is married. It used to be the center of the world. Maybe Paris - the seething banlieue spirit, wallowing but also completely willing to punch an authority in the face.

[Sunday Friend is one long indictment of the EU.](http://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/5490276-5490345-5490598-5490949-5490950-5490392-5490297-5490008-5490661-5490444-5490601-5490009-5490909-5490341#5490341) Which leads us to "Moralism", the ruling ideology.

<!-- The hole in the world. Pale came with humans. Pollution is a stupid metaphor target. So what else? -->

<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Justice -->
<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_regina -->

<br><br>

### The system of the world

If our world can be said to have a system, it is Humanism (bourgeois morality, rights) plus neoliberalism (international capital) plus nationalism (which in _DE_ is portrayed quite positively, in the post-commune Revachol demi-pride of Kim and many others).


But what _is_ the relationship between ultraliberalism (capitalism) and Moralism (humanism). On the face of it they seem unrelated, answering different questions, with different temperaments. How do they share power? Are they the same thing, is one a mask for the other to operate more freely with a good conscience?

I don't think the game has the answers. It's probably their weakest treatment of the big ideologies, because it fails to note _any_ common ground between centrism and leftism - the fucking labour movement being the obvious one, human rights, antiwar, [growth](http://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/3621637). Even a cartoon punk band of 20 year olds can do <a href="{{baby}}">better</a> than that ("_We marched together for the eight-hour day / and held hands in the streets of Seattle._")

Against the general dismissal and othering of liberals, we have to note KHTK's loving portrait of Kim, the sincere, decent Moralist - whose portrait, on screen for most of the game, wears <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/disco-elysium/images/7/77/Kim-kitsuragi.jpg">an actual halo</a>. The icon of self-control and the good side of the professions and the institutions. If commie cop is in some ways the natural path for you to take Harry, every playthrough will have the same Kim.

<!-- "stable shape compared to the blurry smears of colour we see in other portraits, which indicates Kim's role as an anchor"  -->

Kim aside, in the broader geopolitics of Elysium I smell the Chomskyan vice: assuming that every event and every ill has a designer. Obviously a Western designer or a Western puppet. <!-- Haiti is one exception.  -->


The main valid jab is at the hypocrisy of institutional humanism. We killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, or got them killed, in the name of freedom, democracy, human rights, education, etc. [We tortured many others](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/complicity-in-torture-the-case-against-the-united-kingdom-9922063.html). This was not long ago and is not the most recent case.

> The First World War was, like the abattoir in Vietnam, quite describable as a liberals’ war. Any medium-run view of history will show that it did more damage to ‘Western civilisation’ than any form of ideology, not least in clearing the very path, through the ruins and cadavers, along which totalitarians could later instate and militarise themselves...  Yet I think it’s clear... that it was the disturbance to the natural order that made the young Isaiah tremble and flinch... it would have been more precise to say: [horror] only for certain sorts of physical violence and political experiment. Policemen are supposed to control crowds, not crowds policemen. Vietnam... was a laboratory experiment run by technician-intellectuals and academic consultants, who furnished us with terms like ‘interdict’, ‘relocate’, ‘body count’ and ‘strategic hamlet’. To cope with the ensuing calamity, the Bundys and McNamaras later evolved the view that, while the war might have been a blunder, the error could, for reasons of state and for reasons of face, not be admitted. In this, too, they were seconded by Berlin. 

<center>— <a href="{{hitch}}">Hitchens</a></center>

<br>

All we can say is that it murders less. We mustn't say this very proudly.


<!-- McCloskey. Growth and moral generosity. -->


<!-- Reddit on the ultra ending: "These complaints all feel sort of thematically fitting to the whole moralist attitude. Nothing happens, nothing changes, nothing improves. Everything just fizzles out." -->


<br><br>

<!-- > Now this ideology is only represented by student book clubs and old, decaying philosophers. -->

### Depressive leftism

> “Instead of building Communism, he now builds a precise model of this grotesque, duplicitous world.”

<br>

> "The Gottwald School believe that intellectuals as a class are incapable of sparking revolutionary change, so all they can do is *critique* capitalism from inside itself."
> LOGIC - In other words, they have lost faith in their own relevance.

<br>

> You: If communism keeps failing every time we try it...<br>
Steban: (he waits patiently for you to finish)<br>
You: ...And the rest of the world keep killing us for our beliefs...<br>
Steban: Yes?<br>
Volition: Say it.<br>
You: ...What's the point?<br>
Steban: (he considers your words for a minute)<br>
Composure: You're witnessing his ironic armour melt before you. This is his *true self* you're seeing now.<br>
Empathy: He's thinking about someone...<br>
You: Wait, who is he thinking about?<br>
Empathy: Hard to say. Someone dear to him.<br><br>
...The only promise it offers is that the future can be better than the past, if we're willing to work and fight and die for it.<br>
You: But what if humanity keeps letting us down?<br>
Steban: Nobody said fulfilling the proletariat's historic role would be easy. (he smiles a tight smile) It demands great faith with no promise of tangible reward. But that doesn't mean we can simply give up.
You: Even when they ignore us?<br>
Steban: Even then.<br>
Ulixes: Mazov says it's the arrogance of capital that will be its ultimate undoing. It does not believe it can fail, which is why it must fail.<br>
Volition: So young. So *unbearably* young...<br>
Half Light: Why do you see the two of them with their backs against a bullet-pocked wall, all of a sudden?<br>
Inland Empire: Their faces, blurred yet frozen as though in ambrotype. You were never *that young*, were you?<br>
Steban: I guess you could say we believe it *because it's impossible*. (he looks at the scattered matchboxes on the ground) It's our way of saying we refuse to accept that the world has to remain... like this...<br>

<br>

You'd never guess these days, but I come from the hard left (protested the Iraq war, called my college microeconomics class "capitalist missiology", rejected careerism as a racket, etc). It is common to mock the hard left for talking big and being totally ineffectual. But this is wisdom in a modern radical! No one with any awareness of history, human motivations, economics, or current affairs can think that the state of things is ok. But no one with any awareness of history, human motivations, economics, or current affairs can think that solving things would be easy, that you violently wresting the reins of power would end well. So you stand to the side and shout. 

<br>

I chose something else though: actually helping.


<blockquote>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Anonymous asked</span>: 'you have the most hilariously naive politics i've ever seen, it's milquetoast pacifist liberalism meets autistic rationalism. grow a fucking backbone you fuck.'<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Unitofcaring</span>: certain subbubbles of the Left have constructed this environment in which it is inherently pathetic, inherently contemptible, to say “mass murder is a really awful thing and if we can achieve our goals without it that’s worth striving for” or even “no matter what, I won’t endorse or participate in mass murder”. <br /><br />I can imagine how I’d be a Marxist. 30,000 kids die preventable deaths every day and that makes me angrier and sadder than you can possibly imagine and if I’d gotten ensnared in an ideology that claimed the only way for that to end was to kill all of the rich people, I’d probably also go around saying “kill all the rich people!” But I hope I’d never, ever equate “willingness to call for murder” with “moral strength” or “strength of character”.<br /><br />Valuing life is moral strength. Protecting people is strength of character. Calling for mass murder from your keyboard is cowardice. And the communities that deny those things, that circle the wagons around their conviction that willingness to kill people is equivalent to having a backbone, that claiming “the rich all deserve to die” is moral strength, that caring about human life is hilariously naive -<br /><br />- well, first of all, you’ll never get anything done. My friends and I will end those  deaths, eradicate malaria, fix global inequality, hunt down every source of human suffering and watch it take its last breath while you’ll sit there going “milquetoast pacifists! hilariously naive! the rich are not innocent!”. But second of all, you’ll spend your not-accomplishing-anything time in a bubble where caring about all human life is a weakness, where not wanting to murder people is disgusting and contemptible, and I know people are different psychologically but I can’t imagine anything worse than that.<br /><br />...come join us, we milquetoast autistic rationalist liberals, because you don’t have to rant on the internet about killing people to earn our esteem, you just have to fix stuff.

### Life imitates art

> Capital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself. Even those who would *critique* capital end up *reinforcing* it instead...”

The game is enhanced further by the extremely on-the-nose drama that befell the studio: they suffered <a href="{{kompus}}">something like a hostile takeover</a> and embezzlement after its initial success attracted the sharks. The details are hazy, behind the standard totally opaque walls of commerce.

That black comedy is ready to birth another: the new owners sold the film rights to DE's capitalist realism -- brought to you by [the creators](https://www.dj2entertainment.com/blog/https/varietycom/2020/tv/news/disco-elysium-tv-series-1234690455) of "Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie" (2020).

Cynical as they are, realistic as they are, idealistic as they are, they don't go far enough along any of these axes. _Cynicism_: Revolution is a youth politics for a reason: it's a great signal and offers the young and psychotic resources they can't get otherwise. _Realistic_: the world is not actually broken. It's unfair and contains many terrible things, and no we cannot actually solve collective action problems by saying nice words and hoping hard, but that's different from being hopeless, valueless, in pieces. _Idealistic_: The world is getting better in many ways, in spite of rent-seekers and bastards. Individuals are surprisingly powerful and the system still has millions of holes in it.

But playing it I am reminded what is great about the left – the cussed rejection of compromise, the joy of deviance, the white-hot rage inside compassion, also the shrug. I am not as I was before. I am open to other experiments, weirder art, weirder people, ready to be disappointed again, chambered and aimed.

> unexpected, beautiful things are still possible with moments like the Phasmid scene and the brief glimmers of genuine solidarity among its characters. The dice-rolling nature of the game itself asserts that while we have very little control over our lives, there is always possibility.
