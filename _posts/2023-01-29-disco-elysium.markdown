<!-- > "If there has been anything in the history of popular music which could be described as a work of art in a way that people who are involved in other areas of art would understand, then Trout Mask Replica is probably that work" -->
<!-- - John Peel -->


> "Every school of thought and government has failed in this city — but I love it nonetheless. It belongs to me as much as it belongs to you.”

- Kim



> "Blending often incompatible systems of thought, the resulting hodge-podge lacked rigour from the stern standpoint of academics and ideologues alike. But in rock music a little rigour is rather bracing and galvanizing. Too much is plain rigid, but Gang of Four hit just the right balance. In the grand tradition of British art-rock, theory helped them achieve the sort of conceptual breakthroughs that more organically evolving groups never reach"

A new game of _Disco Elysium_ presents you immediately with 24 bizarre skills, half of which you can't vaguely understand the function of. The script is about <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/disco-elysium-script-length-one-million-words/">2000</a> pages long. The soundtrack screeches at you. In a real sense it took <a href="https://www.articy.com/en/showcase/disco-elysium/">19 years</a> to make.

It is yet another lesson, if you needed one, that there is no genre so overdone, no trope too passe, that a great artist cannot wring more greatness out of. DE is a whodunnit with an amnesic protagonist for fuck's sake!

In art, nothing is ruined, nothing is useless, nothing is meaningless. This is one reason it can never be realistic.

Existentialism and post-marxism and Lucian Freud art and post-rock ambience

<br>

It's the sort of thing people wrongly call pretentious, because people don't get that pretension is about _pretence_: pretending to be deeper than you are. Being abstruse isn't enough. More politically sophisticated than most books, more psychologically deep. It's melancholy but not self-pitying and not life-denying. It's cynical but not sneering and not unkind. The grail.

Subcultures and archetypes it depicts perfectly: cops, drugs, organic racism, ..., rave philosophers, locker room nastiness, eugenicists, perfect liars, and a templar. 

I cannot compress it. I could spend another dozen hours noticing and synthesising. They made a game much [smarter than themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1gKGq44NxQ). This almost never happens.

It is memeable, and it is ripe for appropriation by the dirtbag left (see the [dubious Chapo](https://www.vg247.com/how-the-last-living-soviet-video-game-developers-recruited-chapo-trap-house-for-disco-elysium) voiceovers in the original cut). But it is far less simple than that, or, you have to work to make it that simple, and ignore 90% of the game.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipstream_genre


Kurvitz, Hindpere, Tuulik, Keenan 

Its misanthropy is pretty toothless - evil apes. It depicts racism in more detail than I thought was possible in art.

Some themes (The wonderful thing is that there is much more in here. Redemption - everyone's first play through is redemption - is only the simplest and most obvious route through): 

<br><br>

### Gettier superstitions

> "We're big fans of Émile Zola but if there's one thing he leaves out, it’s the supernatural. we live in a world where, even in the C21st we don't really understand what's happening... I think in order to truly represent life realistically, you have to have a complete unknown."

Plaisance is right about the presence. Morrell is right about the phasmid. Harry is constantly right on hunches

<br><br>

### The political is personal

It's correct to locate the origins and energy of fascism in personal grievance, gut feelings about purity,. But so too for communism. 

Organic vs theory. Ordinary racist vs Measurehead. Titus Hardie vs the Deserter.

Love is a metaphor for communism in several places. Both are the struggle which always fails. Breakups are failed revolutions. This similarity is why people have done such terrible things in the name of it:

> Real darkness has love for a face.


It is one thing to be a young communist in Britain, where our party was tiny and its evils limited to ruining a dozen lives. It is quite mad to be a young communist in Estonia, where everyone's grandparents still remember someone they shot. ("Last Living Soviet Video Game Developers")

Hatred. Rene and Dros are the same. The desensitization of one is organic (rooted in nostalgia) and one is theory

This is one of the actual deconstructions here - K&H are obviously deeply, over-the-top political, but they are satirising their own kind. Harry calls Dora a war criminal and identifies her with the mythical Europa figure who I can't quite place. Justice?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelus_Novus

<br><br>

### The personal is not political

You can internalise Marxism-Leninism and spout about it in nearly every conversation - and this doesn't constrain your behaviour at all. You still wear whatever, lech, shoot people.

You can max out the communism, fascism, neoliberalism, and bureaucratic humanism. You can be an actual Nazi feminist. Not all bad things are the same thing, and people are rarely good on every topic.

<br><br>

### Chaos as ladder

Kurvits and Hindpere are not idiots. They know that monsters usually abuse the revolution, that they usually take over the Party. The Claires are the , though I don't think they are the amoral and fully insincere kind of monster. 

To my surprise they depict the union as extremely ambiguous. A giant giga-racist is their bouncer.

They give Wild Pines the extremely sympathetic and genre-savvy Joyce. But then they go even further and show us Dros, who was made into a monster, a terrifying Templar with a mind completely poisoned by ideology.

(Bit crazy for a critique of ideology to come from avowed communists in a country devastated by actually-existing communism, but again they are artists, they can be more than themselves.)


<br><br>

### Ambivalence towards art and work

Contempt for rave babble and the idiot edginess of Skulls. Mistaking artistic shock for political statement. 

> "[The world] is such a precarious place. Nothing ever works out the way you wanted. That’s why people like role-playing games. You can be whoever you want to be. You can try again."


The developers are represented throughout the game. The failure of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160517101025/http://devblog.fortressoccident.com/">Fortress Accident</a> is their fear for their own fate. 

> YOU: Are there people in there?<br>SHIVERS - Yes, [ZA/UM] hard at work at their desks. They can barely tell if it's day or night anymore because the lights in the building are so uniform and bright. Who knows when they'll come out?<br>YOU - What keeps them motivated?<br>SHIVERS - Irony. They're yuppies masquerading as Mazovians... Or was it Mazovians masquerading as yuppies? Even they get confused sometimes...



Quite scary: even marxists as sophisticated as K&H have still internalised the idea that work is bad, even creative work, and that hard work is stupid. Million miles from Marx.

They obviously worked their arses off though. So I wonder if this negativity about is a rare moment of pandering.

> It's a small price to pay, a single human life, a little heart attack to make the greatest CRPG the world has ever seen! We are Eastern Europeans. We need to make best computer RPG made!"

<br><br>

### The golden hammer

Four totally different ways of playing: Abstraction, intuition and emotion, aggression, embodied Motorics (cognition / integration). 

> At high levels, Hand/Eye Coordination makes you deadly – supposing you’ve a weapon in your hand. But once you do, Hand/Eye Coordination will compel you to take the shot – even if it’s not the best approach.


### Umwelt, flashes, multiagent mind.

It's a remarkable portrait of the bundle of impressions, hallucinations, hunches, scherzos that forms a sensitive person.

> "It would be unbelievable to use our skill system to speak about the bodily sensations of having another organism inside of you, while you're in the setting and talking to another person."

<br><br>

### Malleability of the soul

the struggle to reconstruct a personality amidst the ruins of society

<br><br>

### Europe. 

It's very European - the writers steal stereotypes and words from all over the place, but smear them. Revachol is Berlin 1946, East Berlin 1975, Haiti, New Orleans. No one is married. It used to be the center of the world. Maybe Paris - the seething banlieue spirit, wallowing but also completely willing to punch an authority in the face.

Sunday Friend is a indictment of the EU. 

The hole in the world. Pale came with humans. Pollution is a stupid metaphor target. So what else?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Justice
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_regina

<br><br>

### The system of the world

If the world can even be said to have a system, it is Humanism (bourgeois morality, rights) plus neoliberalism (international capital) plus nationalism (which is actually portrayed quite positively, as the post-commune Revachol demi-pride of Kim and many others).



> “Instead of building Communism, he now builds a precise model of this grotesque, duplicitous world.”


What _is_ the relationship between ultraliberalism and Moralism? (Capitalism and humanism.) How do they share power? Are they the same thing, is one a mask for the other to operate more freely with a good conscience?

This is probably their weakest treatment of a big ideology, because it fails to note any common ground between centrism and leftism - the fucking labour movement being the obvious one, human rights, antiwar. Even a cartoonish punk band of 20 year olds can do <a href="{{baby}}">better</a> than this ("We marched together for the eight-hour day / and held hands in the streets of Seattle.")

Against this, we have their loving portrait of Kim, the sincere, decent, principled Moralist. The icon of self-control and the good side of the professions and the institutions. If commie cop is in some ways the natural path for you to take Harry, every playthrough will have the same Kim.

Their main valid jab is at the hypocrisy of institutional humanism. We killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, or got them killed, in the name of freedom, democracy, human rights, education, etc.

> The First World War was, like the abattoir in Vietnam, quite describable as a liberals’ war. Any medium-run view of history will show that it did more damage to ‘Western civilisation’ than any form of ideology, not least in clearing the very path, through the ruins and cadavers, along which totalitarians could later instate and militarise themselves...  Yet I think it’s clear... that it was the disturbance to the natural order that made the young Isaiah tremble and flinch... Ignatieff is surely right to say that the episode with the arrested policeman ‘continued to work within Berlin, strengthening his horror of physical violence and his suspicion of political experiment’. But it would have been more precise to say: only for certain sorts of physical violence and political experiment. Policemen are supposed to control crowds, not crowds policemen. Vietnam, for example, was not just an instance of horrific premeditated violence. It was a laboratory experiment run by technician-intellectuals and academic consultants, who furnished us with terms like ‘interdict’, ‘relocate’, ‘body count’ and ‘strategic hamlet’. To cope with the ensuing calamity, the Bundys and McNamaras later evolved the view that, while the war might have been a blunder, the error could, for reasons of state and for reasons of face, not be admitted. In this, too, they were seconded by Berlin.

All we can say is that it murders less. We mustn't say this proudly.


McCloskey. Growth and moral generosity.


Reddit on the ultra ending: "These complaints all feel sort of thematically fitting to the whole moralist attitude. Nothing happens, nothing changes, nothing improves. Everything just fizzles out."


The Chomskyan vice of assuming that every event and every I'll has a designer. Obviously a Western designer or a Western puppet. Haiti is one exception. 

They don't do quite as well on fascism or neoliberalism or centrism. But still a more accurate and thoughtful picture than nearly any other Marxists ever



You _could_ reconstruct the great dialogue tree... in dozens of choose-your-own adventure paper books.


> You: If communism keeps failing every time we try it...
Steban: (he waits patiently for you to finish)
You: ...And the rest of the world keep killing us for our beliefs...
Steban: Yes?
Volition: Say it.
You: ...What's the point?
Steban: (he considers your words for a minute)
Composure: You're witnessing his ironic armour melt before you. This is his *true self* you're seeing now.
Empathy: He's thinking about someone...
You: Wait, who is he thinking about?
Empathy: Hard to say. Someone dear to him.

...The only promise it offers is that the future can be better than the past, if we're willing to work and fight and die for it.
You: But what if humanity keeps letting us down?
Steban: Nobody said fulfilling the proletariat's historic role would be easy. (he smiles a tight smile) It demands great faith with no promise of tangible reward. But that doesn't mean we can simply give up.
You: Even when they ignore us?
Steban: Even then.
Ulixes: Mazov says it's the arrogance of capital that will be its ultimate undoing. It does not believe it can fail, which is why it must fail.
Volition: So young. So *unbearably* young...
Half Light: Why do you see the two of them with their backs against a bullet-pocked wall, all of a sudden?
Inland Empire: Their faces, blurred yet frozen as though in ambrotype. You were never *that young*, were you?
Steban: I guess you could say we believe it *because it's impossible*. (he looks at the scattered matchboxes on the ground) It's our way of saying we refuse to accept that the world has to remain... like this...

## Life imitates art

> Capital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself. Even those who would *critique* capital end up *reinforcing* it instead...”

<br>

The game is greatly enhanced by the extremely on-the-nose drama that befell the studio: they suffered something like a hostile takeover _after_ its initial 2019 success attracted the sharks. The details are hazy, behind the standard totally opaque walls of commerce. Was Kender an Ephialtes?


This dark comedy is ready to birth a domino comedy: capitalist realism, brought to you by [the creators](https://www.dj2entertainment.com/blog/https/varietycom/2020/tv/news/disco-elysium-tv-series-1234690455) of "Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie" (2020).

Cynical as they are, realistic as they are, idealistic as they are, they don't go far enough along any of these axes. Cynicism: Revolution is a youth politics for a reason: it's a great signal and offers the young and psychotic resources they can't get otherwise. Realistic: the world is not actually broken dude. It's unfair and contains terrible things, and no you cannot actually solve collective action problems by saying nice words and hoping real hard, but this is a different thing. Idealistic: The world is getting better in many ways, in spite of rent-seekers and bastards. Individuals are surprisingly powerful and the system still has millions of holes in it.

How did they make the best RPG ever? Well, spending 18 years on it must've helped. I want to give their marxism its due too. The truth or usefulness of the theory isn't the main thing when you're making art. This then is the _latent_ function of critical theory: making people make interesting art, by removing certain preconceptions and instilling new ones.

But playing it I am reminded of what is great about the left - the cussed rejection of compromise, the joy of deviance, the shrug, the defiance, the stamping of feet until something is done about The Thing. I am opened to other experimental works, ready to be disappointed again, chambered and aimed. I am not the same as I was.

<br><br>

> unexpected, beautiful things are still possible with moments like the Phasmid scene and the brief glimmers of genuine solidarity among its characters. The dice-rolling nature of the game itself asserts that while we have very little control over our lives, there is always possibility. 

> "You are a violent and irrepressible miracle. The vacuum of cosmos and the stars burning in it are afraid of you."
— The Insulindian Phasmid



> The furies are at home<br>in the mirror; it is their address.<br>Even the clearest water,<br>if deep enough can drown.<br><br>Never think to surprise them.<br>
Your face approaching ever<br>
so friendly is the white flag<br>
they ignore. There is no truce<br><br>with the furies. A mirror’s temperature
is always at zero. It is ice
in the veins. Its camera
is an X-ray. It is a chalice<br><br>held out to you in<br>silent communion, where gaspingly<br>you partake of a shifting<br>
identity never your own.<br>
