3. Money
4. Meaning


High-school maths forces you to sit and pretend to be a computer: read an input (a bullshit problem), learn these three rules (e.g. when you see a problem of x type, go through "SOHCAHTOA" until you find the correct ratio to use) and dumbly output your steps and the answer. There's no creativity, no link to reality, no room for you to be yourself, no point. It makes you feel awful and incompetent because there's no way to hide from your mistakes. Your teachers are dried-up inside from teaching boring things they have no control over, to a hostile and bored audience, for decades in a row.Why on earth would anyone _voluntarily_ do this to themselves? Well, because high-school maths is nothing like real maths, like independent maths.

* Because maths is at the root of most of progress. We have electricity because of physics and computers because of mathematical logic + engineering. Disease is rare because of epidemiology - a branch of stats, which is a branch of maths - and engineering (applied mathematics). "When will I use this?""When do you see an athlete using pressups during a match?"

* Because it teaches good thought. When I was 18 I tried to take a shortcut to knowledge, to wisdom. I hated high-school maths, so I ran quite far in the other direction: philosophy and literature. It didn't work. All the questions I want to answer* Because it's beautiful. Maths is vast and clean. It's totally above politics. "Physics is the science of determining which subset of mathematics the universe respects."

* Because it opens the best jobs. Maybe it seems petty to you to choose things based on how much money they bring you - and you'd be right! There's so much more to life. Except, it's not just money. Because there's always a shortage of technical people (programmers, statisticians, data scientists, economists), they are forced to treat you really well. I've seen both sides of this, as an Arts graduate and later as a software graduate. Before, finding a job was always hard, took months. This is stressful, if your parents can't support you (and you're 23 years old, so why should they?). These days I get three invitations to apply to things a week. Because my current work know that I'm in high demand, they have to make it worth my while with raises and perks: my income doubled (£26k to £55k) in 3 years. Still, though, there's more to life than being comfortable. Where's the adventure? Where's the aid to those in need? 

* Adventure: I work in machine learning, which is the insider's word for AI. As such, I'm part of an extremely grand project: the process of humanity creating computers smart enough that we don't have to work, so that one day our descendents can live their lives free from alarm clocks, 2 hour commutes, from meetings, from bs reports, from Powerpoint, from office politics, from being ordered around. I couldn't do this work if I hadn't done maths.

* Altruism: Well, last year I gave £10k to charity. If you give to the best, most scientific charities, then this works out to saving about 3 lives, every year. This is far more important than not eating meat, or not owning a car, or buying FairTrade, or .So, for a small number of people (those who can sit still during the appalling training phase) maths consists in or opens up the most important things in life: truth-seeking, prosperity, and lasting aid to one's fellow humans.

I read "Math with Bad Drawings" myself, and even though I've been trying to learn this stuff for 6 years now I learned so much. He's a teacher, and I hope that you get a sense of what the real kind of maths is like. Some kids get to learn from this guy, and I am so envious.

This is an example of how stats can salve or remove emotional pain. We are naturally dramatic creatures, and we suffer for it.            

everyone needs to learn at least one technical subject. Physics; computer science; evolutionary biology; or Bayesian probability theory, but something. Someone with no technical subjects under their belt has no referent for what it means to "explain" something. They may think "All is Fire" is an explanation.
