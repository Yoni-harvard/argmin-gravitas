yes, yes, I mostly don't have enough information to attribute policies to him, and yes this isn't a good model of policymaking even for the most powerful advisors


+ Doubling of R&D budget (by 2025)

+ [Pushed SAGE into an earlier lockdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-28/top-aide-to-u-k-s-johnson-pushed-scientists-to-back-lockdown). That article and their sources try to make this out to be a bad thing, but it would be immoral to do anything else.


+ £800m ARPA like

+ £300m STEM funding

+ Uncapped immigration path for scientists

+ Tutoring in state schools

- Associated data science, superforecasting and evidence-based policy with dickheads, racists, and edgelords. Weirdo scheme may mean Whitehall hiring even more staid in the short run.

- Something something bullying, norms, deception, centralisation of power. Whipping the Treasury probably not a good precedent.

- Hypocrisy probably weakened lockdown norms.

- Not sure how much of the immigration burdens (NHS surcharge etc) are DC.

? No idea if he changed Whitehall at all.

? Hypocrisy. Wasted a huge amount of Johnson's political capital during a public health crisis
