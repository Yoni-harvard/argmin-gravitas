> [Say] I have... a young white male student, politically-correct, who says: “I am only a bourgeois white male, I can’t speak.” ...<br /> I say to them: “Why not develop a certain degree of rage against the history that has written such an abject script for you that you are silenced?” ... investigate what it is that silences you, rather than take this very deterministic position – since my skin colour is this, since my sex is this, I cannot speak...<br> if you make it your task not only to learn what is going on through language, but also at the same time through a historical critique of your position, then you will have earned the right to criticize, to be heard. When you take the position of not doing your homework - “I will not criticize because of my accident of birth, the historical accident” - that is the much more pernicious position.

I was a romantic teen, so I did a philosophy degree. (Philosophy, it turns out, includes a lot of the most relentlessly unromantic, counterintuitive, and indeed anti-human writers in the world.)

But I didn't focus. Instead I went to lectures in sociology, politics, English, gender studies, history, anthropology, and "Area Studies". When I read economics I only got on with the self-styled "<a href="{{het}}">heterodoxy</a>". I fell in with the kinds of people who think they have done intellectual work by calling something neoliberalism, who mock attempts at objective analysis of human behaviour merely because it is really hard and often done poorly. 

Later, when it finally came time to go and Do Something, I got into analysis, evaluation, and decision theory. I even <a href="/ou">learned some maths</a>. I realised that my misgivings about e.g. <a href="/econ-life">economic analysis</a> were about a strawman; that e.g. genetics was at that very moment transforming our understanding of <a href="{{pre}}">human prehistory</a> and <a href="{{nat}}">human nature</a>.

Somewhere along the way of becoming a scientist, without realising it, I had fallen into the culture war, the terrible idiot descendent of the <a href="{{sci}}">90s science wars</a>. This usually involves writing off many entire fields as intellectually bankrupt. I should really have avoided this, since I had deeply valued these things just a few years before. But this memeplex is very good at making smart people do stupid things.

Queer theory is not all of LGBT studies. Critical race theory is not all of Black studies. Nor are all of queer theory or critical race theory discreditable. (One moment which jolted me out of my silly lazy see-sawing was the above Spivak quote, calling people in to think for themselves regardless of identity. For those who don't follow academic gossip, Spivak is a descendent of the arch-villain Derrida.) The degree of stereotyping and weak-manning on each side of the culture war is really, really disheartening.

<a href="/ignorance">You have to ignore some things</a>; human thought is too large not to. But you don't have to sneer, and you certainly don't have to generalise like a fool. All kinds of thinkers know what you can lose by thresholding a continuous variable; the others have a more verbal (and less accretive) way of putting it.

So right now I'm enjoying going back to the start and mining derided thinkers for insights. With charity and a spot of strong misreading, this is generally great fun.

This is not to say everything's equally fruitful, rigorous, making progress at an equal rate or value. I fully expect to hit another level of the dialectic someday, when methods for detecting <a href="{{deg}}">degenerative research programmes</a> improve and I can objectively ignore. But in the meantime it looks like few fields have only one programme, and few have only nonsense ones.

## Sociology

* Pierre Bourdieu. People think he's one of the pseuds just because he writes really badly. But he was never part of the edgelord cafe set, he reinvented PCA, and was the best empiricist in the field for a long time.

* Kieran Healy. His twitter is one of my top 10.

* Collins

<br>

## Cultural anthropology

* Ernest Gellner.
* David Graeber. An exception in this list, because he says false things fairly often and more generally filters evidence poorly.
* Latour

I'm not going to cheat and include any of the many awesome physical anthropologists like John Hawks.

<br>

## Law

* Tom Bingham


<br>

## LGBT studies

* John d'Emilio.

Sadly, Hite and Kinsey are not worth reading except for historical interest.
<br>

## Gender studies

* Serano?
* Rich?
* Eve Sedgwick?


<br>

## Critical theory / philosophy

* Rorty
* Nancy Fraser
* Ian Hacking's The Social Construction of What?

<br>
