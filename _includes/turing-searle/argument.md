	<li>Searle: "purely syntactic systems lack subjective experiences."</li>
	<li>Searle: "I have subjective experiences."</li>
	<li>So Searle: "I am not a purely syntactic system." (modus tollens, 1&2)</li>
	<li>The only system Searle has knowledge of the subjective experiences of is himself.</li>
	<li>So if Searle is not a purely syntactic system, he has no knowledge of what it is like to be a purely syntactic system,</li>
	<li>So if Searle is not a purely syntactic system, he therefore cannot assert premise 1. (5, + the knowledge account of assertion).</li>
	<li>But if Searle is a purely syntactic system, (1) is false. (by 2)</li>
	<li>You're either a purely syntactic system or you're not.</li>
	<li>Therefore premise (1) is either unwarranted or false. (by 6 & 7 & 8 )</li>
