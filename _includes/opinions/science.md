		I am extremely ignorant about myself. My preferences, my aliefs, my causes. So are you for you.

		<a href="/games-of-life">It seems</a> that reinforcement learning, game theory, evolutionary game theory, and theoretical market calculation are very close and in many places equivalent. The thing they all are special casing could be called "distributed optimisation". This is mind-bending, a perfect illustration of the absolute power and relevance of computational complexity, and maybe useful.

		OPEC, the oil cartel, are one of the most effective environmental groups in history. By keeping the price of oil about a times higher than it would be under competitive pressure, they drove massive improvements in heating efficiency and a de facto subsidy for nonoil energy development.<br>

		Academic publishing is not rational. Pre-publication peer review is weak; post-publication peer review is where it's at.

		It is wrong to believe on insufficient evidence. This might be because it reliably leads to moral harm, or might be in itself. It is very often wrong to not act on insufficient evidence.<br>

		Debate is probably bad. It encourages an undetectable form of irrationality, rewards aggression and wit over accuracy, and drives attention away from nonbinary, nondecisive evidence.<br>

		Ivy League online courses have a 95% dropout rate. You can learn from the greatest lecturers in the world, for free. Yet, when you withdraw the job-market signalling of a Degree, no one gives a fuck. Combined with the fact that most internet-connected people do not even enrol, we have grounds for a terrible fact: A huge majority of people are not intrinsically interested in learning.<br>

		Freud was not a scientist. He did not discover the unconscious. He does not deserve most of the acclaim he received and still receives.<br>

		A great many of the most famous findings in psychology of the C20th and C21st are <a href="{{p}}">exaggerated or spurious</a>. The replication crisis means that you should apply a sceptical prior, shrinking all nonpreregristered effect sizes by a factor of 2 to 10.<br>

		Having a degree in a topic means surprisingly little about your knowledge of it, your authority over it, your ability to apply it to appropriate domains. This is partly just due to forgetting.<br>
