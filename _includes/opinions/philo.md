Technology is our only hope for some problems: individual death, species death, life after Sol.


The long-term future of humanity matters much more than anything else.
(<i>Confidence</i>: %)

We need productivity growth, and probably output growth too. There isn't enough output in the world to support everyone yet.
(<i>Confidence</i>: %)

Progress: Contrary to popular and elite opinion, the world has been getting better in key ways (poverty, violence, gender, disability, race discrimination, intellectual depth, freedom) for 70 years, and better in some key ways for 200 years. There’s a chance we could continue this to a dizzying degree.
(<i>Confidence</i>: %)

Heuristics and biases: Humans are deluded in predictable and previously adaptive ways. Why we don’t make sense. Implies scepticism.
(<i>Confidence</i>: %)

Scientific imperialism: Despite that, we sometimes succeed in knowing. It’s wrong to believe things on insufficient evidence. Technical skill is vital for successful thought and some kinds of action. Naturalism works methodologically and maybe ontologically too.
(<i>Confidence</i>: %)

Effective altruism: outcome-oriented, maximizing, cause-impartial egalitarianism. You can’t reliably act morally if you don’t know the truth.
(<i>Confidence</i>: %)

Longtermism: Most value lies in the future; the moral significance of our lives is dominated by our effect on that. Implies focussing on “existential risks”, things that could end the entire future at once.
(<i>Confidence</i>: %)

Cosmopolitanism: The rich world’s relative inaction for the global poor is an enormous moral catastrophe.
(<i>Confidence</i>: %)

Animal welfare: The suffering of nonhumans is also an enormous moral catastrophe.
(<i>Confidence</i>: %)

Bioprogressivism: Nature is not amoral, above judgment. Nor is it obviously good. 

Natural death is an enormous moral catastrophe _in itself_. (Ending it could lead to worse problems, like permanent autocracy, ecological collapse, but probably not unfixable ones.)
(<i>Confidence</i>: %)

Consequentialism can capture the intuitions behind deontology and virtue.
