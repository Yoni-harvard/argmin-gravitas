		Doctors get too much credit for the doubling in longevity in the last 200 years: nutrition and public health measures (plumbing, water treatment, immunisation) <a href="{{deaton}}">explain more</a> than individual medical therapies. (We know this because the largest improvements were before 1920, when medicine really began its stride.) <a href="{{cutler}}">This seems</a> to still be true for the present day. Morbidity might be different.<br>

		Massive amounts of medicine is based on bad or anecdotal evidence. <a href="{{reviews}}">RCTs very often</a> find that age-old, popular, uncontroversial treatments have no average effect, or worse. Doctors <a href="{{ignore}}">often ignore the stats</a> on treatments, relying on binary ideas of risk and contraindication.<br>

		But even the best evidence-based medicine is <a href="{{nnt}}">surprisingly unreliable</a>, in the sense that a given treatment doesn't work for most people. e.g. even <i>morphine</i> has a <a href="{{morph}}">"number needed to treat" post-op pain of 2.9</a>. i.e. on average, it works for every third person it is administered to.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a> <br>

		The UK does not add iodine to its salt; instead it is added to cattle feed and we blindly hope humans get some benefit if they drink a lot of milk. British vegans should take iodised salt, and perhaps also the omnivore population: <a href="{{uk}}">several small studies</a> from the 2010s found that levels in young women were about half the adequate level.  <a href="{{io}}">Society depends on people like this.</a> <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> <br>

		In the general population, multivitamins have no net health benefit, and are even potentially harmful. More generally, antioxidants are not net positive. Many dietary supplements have no effect. <br>

		Vaping is a <a href="{{vap}}">really remarkable</a> public health measure: thousands of times less carcinogens, increased cessation change, <a href="{{second}}">massively reduced second-hand exposure</a>. All of the reported acute deaths involve bootleg vaping fluid. Banning vaping and not smoking is a perfectly perverse policy which should be expected to shorten Californians' lives by thousands of years per calendar year.<br>

		Stannous fluoride toothpaste <a href="{{stan}}">is</a> <a href="{{stan2}}">better</a> for your teeth than the common sodium fluoride; it's antimicrobial. (It used to taste a bit worse.) <br>

		"<a href="{{scaling}}">Prophylactic scaling</a>" - where a dentist scrapes deep between your teeth despite no sign of gum disease, has little evidence of benefit, is unpleasant and expensive, and can damage enamel. <br>

		You should wear earplugs on the subway. Most subways run loud enough to cause permanent damage to your hearing: The London tube reaches 100 dB on some lines. This level of noise causes tinnitus reliably, and tinnitus is associated with depression and suicide.		https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11524-006-9080-3

		Most people wash their hands in a way that doesn't help much. Needs to be >20 seconds, lots of soap, back and front, lots of friction. (Also, washing your hands properly a lot leads to dry skin and cracks, a major risk factor for infections...) <br>

		Around a third of people north of latitude 40 are deficient in vitamin D during winter. (e.g. <a href="{{d}}">UK</a>) Big oral supplement doses work, though you may also need <a href="{{k2}}">extra vitamin K2</a> to clear the induced calcium from your blood.<br>
