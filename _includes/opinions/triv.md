<li>
	Most book reviews contain no critical thought, no more than the blurb plus several "Yay"s or "Boo"s. Trust a review in proportion to the amount of direct quotation in it.

<li>
	Most vegan food is fine, it just doesn't have enough fat. Double the oil and become happy.

<li>
	MSG is a relatively healthy and delicious ingredient for all kinds of cooking. (It contains 1/3 the sodium of table salt.)

	Japanese animation is, on average, better than Western animation - visually, musically, and thematically. (It has worse depths of idiocy, perversion, and repetition, but it is easy to avoid these once you learn the symptoms.)

<li>
	Science fiction is important, since, unlike most fiction, it tries to direct our attention to the unprecedented, what we can change. It is also (contingently) less focussed on incompetence and wallowing. It is where we get to do a dry-run of future moral problems, which are the greatest moral problems.
