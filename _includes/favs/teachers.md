<h3>Teachers</h3>
<div>
	The best teachers I have had are<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>Glen McIntosh (saxophone; a note don't care who plays it)</li>
	<li>Gerald R Harrison (moral philosophy; the transformations of reason)</li>
	<li>Bob Plant (immoral philosophy; more problematic what is left for philosophy to do), </li>
	<!-- <li>Paul Schlicke (Victorian literature; the glory and pity of pity),</li> -->
	<!-- Julian Lethbridge --> 
	<li>Shaomin Lee-Murray (Mandarin; who named me)</li> 
	<li>David Newlands (development economics; the rage inside compassion)</li> 
	<li>Luca Moretti (philosophy of science; stimulants and reality shock)</li>
	<li>Karen Renaud (cybersecurity; the monkey at the helm)</li> 
	<li>Lewis Mackenzie (low-level computing; the awe of bridging the formal and the physical)</li> 
	<li>Chris W Johnson (safety-critical engineering; man in the machine)</li> 
	<!-- <li>Stewart Mackenzie-Leigh (web dev; do they owe us a living?)</li> -->
	<li>John Morrice (software engineering; who taught me how to write these kinds of equations)</li>
	<li>Tom McGrath (reinforcement learning; the sober leap)</li>
	<li>Carl Henrik Ek (Bayesian machine learning; the inability to condescend)</li>
	<!-- <li>Laurence Aitchison (kernel methods, computational neuroscience, computational sociology, statistical mechanics, energy-based modelling)</li> -->
</ul>
<br><br>

The people I have learned the most from, physical proximity be damned:

<ul>
	<li>Andrew Gelman (more than stats, though the stats is titanic: what science should be)</li>
	<li>Scott Alexander ()</li>
	<li>Gwern Branwen ()</li>
	<li>Tyler Cowen ()</li>
</ul>
