Epistemic good: one of the following: true belief, knowledge, personal justification, theoretical understanding, possibly others. 

Virtue: an excellence.  

Epistemic Virtue. habits that promote the acquisition, maintenance, and transmission of epistemic goods 

Normative epistemology: “Why should one believe p?” that which claims that it is the quality of the reasons for our beliefs that converts true beliefs into knowledge. 

Naturalistic epistemology: requires that the conditions in which beliefs are acquired typically produce true beliefs

Virtue epistemology: “focuses on the characteristics of the knower rather than individual beliefs or collections of beliefs. Roughly, the claim is that when a true belief is the result of the exercise of intellectual virtue, it is, ceteris paribus, knowledge.”1

Access internalism: View that an agent should be capable of identifying what makes a given true belief also an instance of knowing. 


Epistemological externalism: ~Access internalism. Truth-connected accounts of justification, arguing that this improves our ability to respond to the skeptical challenge. The externalist’s rejection of access internalism would suggest at least two things for the treatment of epistemic virtue: 

    1) a motivated distinction between reflective and non-reflective knowing &
    2) a corresponding distinction between reflective virtues and faculty virtues. No longer useful to distinguish very sharply between faculties and excellences of faculties; advantage instead lies in treating anything with a function (e.g. eye), as having virtues germane to it.


Epistemic value monism: Thesis that if there is any epistemic value other than the truth of a belief, this value derives from the goodness of truth. Epistemic value pluralism is at minimum the rejection of that claim. One key concern here is that Goldman explicitly hinges the plausibility of an instrumentalist account of the value of the virtues on his veritism, the version of epistemic value monism he explicitly defends (Goldman 2006). 

Constitutivism: intellectual virtues are valuable in themselves. (Roberts & Wood, 2007). The virtues are accorded intrinsic worth as being not only instrumentally related to but also partly constitutive of the intellectual telos, a telos conceived in overtly normative terms: intellectual flourishing, for example. What is important then is the personal worth of the virtues, which is a function of motivational and other factors internal to agency. Epistemic value for Zagzebski (2003) is always derivative from what we care about; it is only motives of caring that give rise to the demand to be epistemically conscientious. 

Motivationism: The epistemic virtues are defined in terms of motives and behavior in the service of what we care about. This motivationist account of the nature of the virtues is non-consequentialist: a trait’s status as an intellectual virtue is not a function of its (external) cognitive outputs or consequences, but rather of motives and emotions attending knowing. In such instances knowing demands reflective engagement, so that by implication beliefs formed in an insufficiently reflective fashion (young children, unenlightened chicken-sexers, etc.) will not count as knowledge.
Virtue responsibilism: view emphasising not primary mechanisms (perception, memory) but traits valued as more virtuous than others. (Creativity, inquisitiveness, rational rigor, honesty.) Generally, these theories are normative in nature. Montmarquet's theory of intellectual virtue is similar to Code's, but specifically defines additional intellectual virtues to defuse potential dogmatism compatible with Code's desire for truth. The primary virtue is conscientiousness, which focuses on the correct end of intellectual living.
Assimilationism: Reduce evirtues to moral virtues. (Zagzebski, Dancy) 

Credit theory of knowing: when an agent knows, she deserves epistemic credit. But credit is attributable in degree and is not simply had or not had, like a binary notion. The ties between credit-attribution and fulfillment of different kinds of anti-luck concerns make it a still more complex issue. But for all of the proponents of credit theories, attributing epistemic virtue and attributing epistemic credit are closely linked. This underlines the key point that neutralizing veritic luck—immunity from the veritic-luck family of Gettier, Lackey, fake barn, lottery, etc. cases—is far from the epistemology’s only legitimate concern.

Epistemic Compatibilism: view that the intuitions behind internalism and externalism needn’t be conceived as driving competing accounts of the same univocal concept, justification. 







Does epistemology need ‘thick’ evaluative concepts?

Epistemological centralism: “No.” View that thin concepts are antecedent to the thick ones; latter are dependent on the former. That is, centralists argue that one must understand words like "right" and "ought" before understanding words like "just" and "unkind." 
Non-centralism: Value Turners. Thin and thick concepts are on a par with one another – and the thick concepts are a sufficient starting point for understanding the thin ones. The sort of theories that will be able to give thick evaluative concepts a deservedly central role in both belief and agent evaluation are those non-centralist projects that fall within what we call the second-wave of virtue epistemology. (Find the right thickness.)
Normative concepts = deontic v evaluative (Engel)
Deontic concepts ('right', 'ought', 'permissible', and 'forbidden,') are by definition thin concepts. 
Evaluative concepts = trait concepts v affective concepts

Evaluative concepts have thins ('good', 'bad', 'desirable') and thicks (trait concepts like 'courageous’ and ‘open-minded,’ and affective concepts like 'rude', 'lewd'). 
A mark of thick concepts is, as Bernard Williams has suggested, that they seem to be simultaneously both evaluative and descriptive:
thin-normative
thick-normative
thin-descriptive
According to Dancy, Bernard Williams, Hilary Putnam, moral agents and moral philosophy both need the thick, intermediate layer of concepts. After all, moral theory should not be concerned only with what is good and bad, right and wrong, all things considered, but also with how agents ought to be (i.e. 'brave,' 'prudent', etc.) in order to best meet, from an ethical point of view, the demands of the world.
If this much is correct, we may ask: does epistemology need thick concepts also? Do the central aims of epistemology, like those of moral philosophy, require that we designate some important place for those concepts located between the thin-normative and the non-normative? What would it mean to say that for epistemic as well as moral agents, our conceptual language is and ought to be ‘entangled’ (Putnam)?

2. Epistemic Normativity

Nature and Scope Argument

1.  Epistemology should be concerned with, first and foremost, the nature and scope of knowledge and justification.
2.  Knowledge and justification are fundamentally non-normative concepts.
3.  Therefore, epistemology should be concerned with the nature and scope of what is conceptually non-normative.

If so thick concepts, such as intellectual virtues, which bridge the evaluative and non-evaluative would not be central to epistemology. A refusal to recognize any distinctly normative dimension within the subject matter of epistemology pervades several prominent philosophical research programs, including naturalized epistemology, counterfactual epistemology and externalist, reliabilist analyses of knowledge. Subsequently, thick evaluative concepts—for these and other projects premised upon the sort tradition captured by the Nature and Scope Argument—are left without any important theoretical role. 

The dogma that knowledge and justification are non-normative is also false. 
To Quine our normative concerns can easily be naturalized; epistemic normativity “is a matter of efficacy for an ulterior end, truth….The normative here…becomes descriptive when the terminal parameter is expressed (1986).” Such a view is premised on there being no serious problem about entanglement of fact and value, and no need of sharing an evaluative perspective in order to fix the extensions of epistemic concepts. 


Review Essay: Jonathan Kvanvig’s The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding

Since certain epistemic goods clearly are valuable or matter to us, our accounts of these goods should at least be sensitive to their value. e.g. Knowledge, one of the great goods. 

Distinctively valuable: A state is distinctively valuable if the value of the state exceeds the value of any proper subset of its constituents. 

The majority of the book represents Kvanvig’s attempt to identify a distinctive value for Knowledge. (Meno problem). 
    • Instrumentalism: knowledge is valuable because of its practical usefulness.  
        ◦ Inadequate explanation for the distinctive value of knowledge because (mere) true belief about the road to Larissa puts us on the right path just as effectively. Thus? Knowledge is not distinctively valuable because a proper subset of its constituents, (mere) true belief, realizes our practical goals just as surely.

Standard view: A true belief stemming from a reliable source is in some sense more valuable than a true belief stemming from an unreliable source.  If so, then perhaps reliabilism. 

Swamping problem: A true belief hailing from a reliable source seems to be no more desirable or worth having than a true belief hailing from an unreliable source. Suppose, for example, you had a choice between two true beliefs, one from a reliable source and one from an unreliable source.  Fact that the game-winning home run was hit by a reliable power hitter (rather than a weak singles hitter) doesn’t enhances the value of the home run.  Once the truth is on the scene its value swamps the value of other properties (such as hailing from a reliable source) that seem to be only instrumentally valuable in relation to the truth.
        ◦ Are any epistemic properties that are not merely instrumentally valuable? Being subjectively justified and being virtuously formed.  



On Lehrer’s Principle of Trustworthiness, by Halbach
Foundationalist picture of knowledge: basic beliefs provide the empirical input on which the whole empirical knowledge of a person should rely. There are convincing arguments showing that this picture is not convincing, because the proposed basic beliefs were not sufficient for providing foundations of knowledge or (problem of the criterion) they were in need of further justification, and therefore not truly basic. 
Coherentist: the distinction between basic and non-basic beliefs is not sensible at all. There may be basic beliefs (coherentism does not have to deny this) but these possibly-existing basic beliefs do not figure prominently in a sound account of epistemic justification. The rejection of basic beliefs as foundations of knowledge, however, seems to deprive us of the determination by empirical input. But if knowledge does not rest on basic beliefs providing the empirical input, how can external factors influence our knowledge at all?  Isolation objection: Like indirect realism, coherentism seems prone to a conception where epistemic agents are completely isolated from the world. Keith Lehrer’s approach to solve the problem:

How do we acquire empirical information, Keith Lehrer? Suppose I accept that 

    1) there is a red rose. This assumption implies in particular that 
1’) I don’t believe that there is a red rose because of wishful thinking; rather I came to believe it with the objective of accepting it only in the case it is true; but so far my belief lacks justification and is thus not yet knowledge. I cannot conclude (and thereby justify) from my acceptance alone that there is a red rose indeed. Given some additional information, however, I can and do usually infer this. The additional premises required may include that 
2) I am not dreaming, 
3) that normal daylight is present, and 
4) that I know roses. 
The common feature of all these premises is that 

*) I must be a reliable epistemic agent in the present kind of situation. 
Principle of trustworthiness: Whatever I accept with the objective of accepting something just in case it is true, I accept in a trustworthy manner. 



Pierre Duhem's Virtue Epistemology - David J. Stump
Scientists must use good sense and have intellectual and moral virtues in order to be neutral arbiters of scientific theories, especially when choosing between empirically adequate theories.  I discuss the parallels in Duhem’s views to those of virtue epistemologists, who understand justified belief as that arrived at by a cognitive agent with intellectual and moral virtues, showing how consideration of Duhem as a virtue epistemologist offers insights into his views, as well as providing possible answers to some puzzles about virtue epistemology.  

We have an intuitive reasoning ability, which Duhem terms "good sense", that allows scientists, like judges in a legal setting, to be able to weigh evidence and to be fair and impartial (Duhem, 1954, p.  218). It has not been generally noticed the extent to which Duhem's "good sense" is an ethical term and the extent to which Duhem thinks that the intellectual and moral virtues of the scientist determine scientific knowledge.  He says that scientists have to be neutral arbiters of theories in order to produce knowledge, thus demanding mature judgment on the part of the scientists.  

Rather than define a virtuous person as one who conforms to principles of morality, the virtue theorist defines a right action as that which would be done by a virtuous person.  Likewise in epistemology, the strong form of virtue epistemology would define justified true belief in terms of what an intellectually virtuous person would believe (Blackburn, 2001, p. 16).  Like contemporary virtue epistemologists, Duhem also takes knowledge to be dependent on the virtues of the knower.  
In the strong form of Zagzebski’s virtue epistemology, justified belief and other epistemic terms are defined in terms of epistemic agents.  A belief is justified because it is the sort of belief that an intellectually virtuous person would have:  "A justified belief is what a person who is motivated by intellectual virtue, and who has the understanding of his cognitive situation a virtuous person would have, might believe in like circumstances" (Zagzebski, 1996, p.  241).  Zagzebski also allows for a weaker version of virtue epistemology in which the belief that an intellectually virtuous person might have acts only as a criterion for justified belief, not as part of the definition:  ".  .  .  in a weak (merely agent-focused) virtue theory, what these ‘definitions’ do is help us fix the properties of right and wrong to their proper objects, but they do not tell us what makes right right or wrong wrong" (Zagzebski, 1996, p.  232).  Zagzebski hopes that all epistemic evaluation can be understood as part of a theory of value that encompasses both ethical and epistemic evaluation:
