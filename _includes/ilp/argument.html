	<li>ILP is an unusual sort of machine learning.</li>
	<li>In particular, its upsides are very different from the upsides of deep learning. In particular, its use of detailed, deterministic prior knowledge.</li>
	<li>It has grave limitations. Some seem tractable, given how little attention it's had.</li>
	<li>However, if the Bitter Lesson is true, then the mainline ILP mission, to use detailed human domain knowledge, is doomed.</li>
