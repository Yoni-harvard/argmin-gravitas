 Since then I found <a href="http://allthebirds.tumblr.com/post/14284705181/hey-new-followers-welcome-to-blessing-all-the-birds">this site</a>, which does great&nbsp;feminist readings and <a href="http://allthebirds.tumblr.com/post/4390533445/further-reading-a-fans-close-reading-of-have-one-on">signal-boosted me</a>, which was nice.

Someone go write things on:


+ I've no taste for "key dates" and recording minutiae, but perhaps someone feels it's worth their scholarly love. 
<br />

+ A more unified story, uniting the farm folks with the phantastical interludes.
<br>


<br>


<br />

+ Haven't seen any proper explanation of the title (or album as drinking music) bar my poisoning-&amp;-betrayal idea, either.

<br />

+ The animal symbolisms.<br /><br />+ There's a really tasty job going: making comparative look-sees between <i>HOOM</i> and <i>MEM</i>, <i>HOOM</i> and <i>Ys</i>.<br /><br />+ Also a treatment of its femininity, across the lavish art design, sound, lyrics.<br />

+ There <i>certainly</i> is serious work in looking at the album's instrumentation. A CUBIT OF KAVAL, A BUCKET OF SACKBUT and so on.


<br />

+ Some proper musicians to listen and ferret out the detail. The rhythms could have a piece on their own; her diction deserves understanding. Half of the songs are in Dmajor; are we to leap, and say these are of the same narrative, or what? 



+ A proper detailed look at her voice, comparisons to classical singing, etc. Technical appraisal of technique.


+ One of the few reviews that rose above mere evaluation:<br />

+ Above-average foruming:<br />

+ A good soul has made a direct reading of the chords...<br />

+ And, of course, you should get up on your personal <i>Have One On Me</i>. This one's only on loan, though the <a href="#section3">Modes</a> are free.
