The overall theme is the closeness of love to many terrible emotions: fear, possession, weakness, unfreedom, subsumption, vengeance, amoral avarice. The key symbols is love as intoxication as poisoning; heartbreak as the inevitable hangover, passion as compulsive vice, love as gluttony. "<i>Have one on me</i>" is disguised aggression towards a neglectful/abusive lover: "drink this gall, traitor". (See also "go long, right over the edge of the earth".)
