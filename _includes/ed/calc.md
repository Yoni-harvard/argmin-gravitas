    	What's the spend per person?<br><br>
    	<!--  -->
    	Going off millennials: About £4k per primary education year per child (£28k), in the 1990s budget. About £6k per secondary education year (£36k). <a href="{{eng}}">In England</a>, the uni participation rate for 17-30s is now 50%. So scale the £45k cost of a 3-year degree by half to get an expected spend. So it's an average of £87,000 per recent person <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>.<br><br>
    <!--  -->
	Plus the opportunity cost of 5 years of work, £50k-100k productivity. Nor does it count whatever the opportunity cost is of 20,000 hours of your youth, legally confiscated from you.<br><br>
	<!--  -->
	However, I think my education cost others about £150,000 <a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6">6</a><a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7">7</a>. Or, £4.7bn a year for the policy (40% over the present budget), if every child in Scotland was as nerdy and shameless as me. (Big if.)<br><br>
	<!--  -->
	There is something beautiful about how hard I had to work to find out this number: in Scotland, the system "worked", in the sense of insulating poor me from all prudential considerations.<br><br>
	<!--  -->
	I told a coworker this figure and, as a good fiscal dove, he was horrified - until he recalled that "at least you were working for most of that". True: even with state largesse, I still worked about 11 years out of these 21.
	<!--  -->
	I doubt my paper round or my waitering or even my database administration offset the social cost, and I doubt he thought it did. What really worried him was the menacing <i>eternal student</i>, who never gets over himself, never stops fearing the long dull throb of work, and who continues to take from others indefinitely.<br><br>
	<!--  -->
	I found this narrow at the time, but now I take it quite seriously.
