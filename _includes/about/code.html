I've been employed to code for <a href="{{yearsCode}}">{{fullYearsSince}}.{{partYearSince}}</a> years <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a>. Of which, I've been employed in machine learning modelling for {{dsYears}}.{{dsModulus}} years.<br><br> 

It is some career. So far I have worked on a precision methadone pump, a website generator for bed & breakfasts, secure off-site credit card storage, procurement streamlining for e.g. 'aerospace' companies, a metre-precise 3D model of Britain's rivers, a performance dashboard for use by secondary school teachers, medical risk scoring models, countermeasures against machine-learning model extraction...<br><br>

	<h3>Experience with</h3>
	<div>
	I try to be nonpartisan about computer languages, since antagonism between (and within) language communities is a really clear example of how strong identities cause perversities. 
	<br><br>

	I have written production code in

	<ul>
		<li>Python (Raw, Pandas, PySpark): <i>e.g.</i> a full notebooked ML pipeline, from sparse raw csvs to GBM to policy implications.</li>
		<li>C# : <i>e.g.</i> An ironclad medicine pump controller with WPF.</li>
		<li>nodeJS : <i>e.g.</i> a secure pharmacy record ("Rx") system. </li>
		<li>Spark : <i>e.g.</i> for detecting model extraction attacks.</li>
		<li>Pig Latin : <i>e.g.</i>.</li>
		<li>bash : e.g. Debugging Hadoop schema issues with Avrotools. Later productionised with Oozie. </li>
		<li>Oozie XML <i>e.g.</i> for chaining Shell and Pig scripts to crunch and mail reports.</li>
		<li>Typescript: <i>e.g.</i> A CRUD procurement app with Angular and .NET.</li>
		<li>PHP : <i>e.g.</i> websites, a cURL handler for a credit card storage API.</li>
		<li>Powershell: <i>e.g.</i> a web scraper (before Python was provisioned).</li>
	</ul>

	I have also written side projects in

	<ul>
		<li> Java : All my Master's degree work: Game of Life, Vigenere cipher, .</li>
		<li> Jekyll : this itself.</li>
		<li> Scala : Just Project Euler so far.</li>
		<li> Rust : Just Project Euler so far.</li>
		<li> bash : An archiver for hyperlinks. </li>

	<h3>Origin story</h3>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<b>2014</b>
				<li>My first language was SAS SQL, learned on the job. (My manager's patience was remarkable.) You never go back to Excel after tasting real interface.</li>
				<li>Got Ubuntu, wiresharked my buddy's surfing habits.</li>
				<li>Conversion course. Java, relational theory, binary, hex, MC6800, Python, HTK, crypto, the radical uncertainty of <a href="{{safety}}">safety-critical code</a>. Thesis on computational (para)linguistics.</li>
				
			<b>2015</b>
				<li>Bluffed my way into a databasing internship two months into that. </li>
				<li>Got a real dev job in a wee startup immediately after, despite being completely open about my ignorance.</li>
				<li>They ran out of money, so I paid my developer dues: worked on a large legacy PHP codebase for a year.</li>
				<li>Built my own Linux box.</li>
				
			<b>2016</b>
				<li>Tried remote working and frontends, learning Angular and Typescript and the strange airless Microsoft dev stack.</li>
				<li>Tired of making websites, got a data science post in the City. Data janitoring, cluster work and dogsbody handywork.</li>
				
			<b>2017</b>
				<li>Finally started to internalise it all. Wrote a link archiver enthusiastically.</li>
				<li>Started functional programming with that Odersky course. Still buzzing.</li>
				<li></li>
