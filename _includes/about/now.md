		I help lead Arb, a research consultancy in the mould of Rethink Priorities, RAND, and <a href="{{iiasa}}">IIASA</a>.<br><br> 	
		We focus on forecasting and other important niche areas (large-scale data collection; machine learning for epistemics). 	Consultancies are reactive, but we have our own agenda - some ideas sketched <a href="{{ideas}}">here</a>.

		3. Becoming less well-rounded
	  </div>
	  <div class="insides">
		My background is extremely mixed: a lot of philosophy, a bit of economics, a bit of stats, a bit of computer science, a bit of computational linguistics, a bit of epidemiology, a bit of literary criticism. But in research, much depends on you mastering one thing or one cluster of things.<br><br>So I am trying to become less rounded. This boils down to more maths. One carrot: I aim to fully understand the great explanations: relativity, QM, evolutionary dynamics, Bayes, reinforcement learning, and computational complexity.

		I started teaching and mentoring people at last. I help with the AI Safety Camp, the EA Bristol Uni group, and teach at ESPR. I received an Infrastructure Fund grant to try and fix executive function in the community (“<a href="{{offroad}}">Off Road</a>”). I speak for the <a href="{{obit}}">dead</a>.
