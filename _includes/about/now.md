<h3>Now</h3>

	<h3>Founding a great research company</h3>
	<!--  -->
	I help lead Arb, a research consultancy in the mould of Rethink Priorities, RAND, and <a href="{{iiasa}}">IIASA</a>. 	We focus on forecasting and other important niche areas (large-scale data collection; machine learning for epistemics). 	Consultancies are reactive, but we have our own agenda - some ideas sketched <a href="{{ideas}}">here</a>. 
	<br><br> 
	<!-- Even great researchers often lack communication skills, people skills, particular engineering skills, or academic shibboleths. As a result, there's a shortage of research managers and technical generalists. I’m the latter already and I'm working on the former. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
	Current work:<br><br>
	<ul>
		<li>I lead a team investigating AI talent for the new Emergent Ventures programme. </li><br>
		<li>Improving the state of AI forecasting</li><br>
		<li>Processing an author's entire corpus and automatically evaluating their forecasting ability</li><br>
		<li>Following my COVID <a href="/researches">work</a>, I’m helping Jan Kulveit set up the <a href="{{alert}}">Active Long-termist Emergency Response Team</a>.</li> 
	</ul>
	<!-- <br>
	I most enjoy the start and the end of projects. -->

	<h3>Side-channel attacks against AI risk</h3>
	I'm interested in keeping an eye on AI. By a stroke of luck my PhD advisor is <a href="{{la}}">Laurence Aitchison</a>. I'm currently on sabbatical. <br><br>
	Besides that, I’m working on a large project upstream of AI forecasting and leading a Mercatus Center project on AI talent, with the aim of bringing in non-financial support like technical mentors, visas, and excitement.

	<h3>Becoming less well-rounded</h3>
	My background is extremely mixed: a lot of philosophy, a bit of economics, a bit of stats, a bit of computational linguistics over there. But in research, much depends on you mastering one thing or one cluster of things.<br><br>So I am trying to become less rounded. This boils down to more maths. One carrot: I aim to fully understand the great explanations: relativity, QM, evolutionary dynamics, reinforcement learning, and computational complexity. 
	<br><br><br>

	<h3>Giving a damn</h3>
	I started teaching and mentoring people. I help with the AI Safety Camp, the EA Bristol student group, and I teach at ESPR. I received an Infrastructure Fund grant to try and fix executive function in the community (“<a href="{{offroad}}">Off Road</a>”). I speak for the <a href="{{obit}}">dead</a>.

	<!-- <h3>Living in the Bahamas</h3>
	I'm on sabbatical in a wonderful community on the island of Nassau. The effect of being surrounded by ambitious kind people is striking.<br>
