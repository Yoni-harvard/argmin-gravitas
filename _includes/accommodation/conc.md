This study sought to develop HMMs to investigate the presence and conditions of linguistic
accommodation. Two hyperparameters were varied, yielding eight permutations and three
interesting results: 1) That multi-state HMMs consistently record fewer significant correlations; 2)
That multi-state models consistently give evidence of the importance of temporal effects in linguistic
accommodation; 3) that the absolute effect size strongly correlates between pairs. In this work, the
interpretation of result (2) is agnostic between two explanations: either that the time part of the
acoustic envelope adds noise that obscures accommodative effects; or else that multi-state models
have higher specificity (rate of true negatives).<br><br>

The main limitation of the project is its observational nature: in the absence of an external measure,
validation of results is limited to the indirect statistical checks covered in section 5.2.i and section 6.<br><br>

We had no control group or external measure to identify false positives generated by the models, to
validate any single judgment about a pair-task, or to enable definitive judgment about which of the
above features or models are ‘better’ at detecting the real extent and nature of accommodation.
This inherent limitation to inference aside, the present project’s limitations are mostly a matter of
modelling extensions precluded by limited time:<br><br>

The SSSV experiment’s method of pairing speakers created an extra variable, personality,
that could have been incorporated: half of the participants were assigned each based on
their compatibility as measured by a prior personality survey.<a href="#fn:66" id="fnref:66">66</a> The above analysis does not
factor in this variable.<br><br>

 The range of models developed fell short of the given dataset’s potential in a few ways: in
particular, there was no word-dependence and phoneme modelling. The more ambitious
form would have been to create monophone and triphone models of each phoneme, and to
reconstruct the accommodation in the phonemes and actual vocabulary spoken by each of
the pairs.<br><br>

 Values for the hyperparameters (the number of Gaussians per mixture and the
dimensionality of the vector space) were taken from the SSSV paper and were not varied. The flat-start initialisation and fixed rounds of re-estimation was also not optimal, relative to allowing dynamic
convergence of parameters.<br><br>

 There was no ‘cross-validation’ (that is, no alternative divisions of the data into the training
and test categories, followed by an iteration of training and testing over these alternative
categorisations, to more rigorously control for variation within the dataset).<br><br>

These limitations offer a clear set of hyperparameters for future accommodation modelling on this
or similar datasets, including most relevantly monophone or triphone modelling (using 40-phoneme
HMMs and being able to breaking down accommodative effects by changes in each) . The development of feature vectors tailored to detect accommodation by combining acoustic variables it has identified in. 

The statistical technique ‘Granger causality’ – inferring the causal direction of two
variables in time-series – could be applied in order to get a better sense of which of the two sides of
accommodation (changes in human air-pressure waves and changes in social signals) are the
underlying process, if it is fact not fundamentally bi-directional. <a href="#fn:67" id="fnref:67">67</a>
