    	That <i>Programmer Competency Matrix</i> is aggressively written: it is exasperated with poor job applicants. But when I was a clueless beginner, I found it helpful for someone to just <i>tell</i> me what exactly I was missing, even if that was a long list and 10 years' work to go.

     	This quotation isn't very relevant, I just think it's bad ass. It is from Judea Pearl's <a href="http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:xom745gab">acceptance speech for the Lakatos Award</a>. <br><br>

        The other very distinct job is of course "data engineer". But those are already distinguished properly in the job market, for the obvious reason that your cluster will crash and burn if you hire the wrong one of them.

        "Newer methods"? Newer than what?<br><br>

        Newer than pre-computer and tiny-sample statistical inference theory. You can get a sense for how new ML is from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/">Bishop (2006)</a>. That book only mentions very important papers. And, in fact, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kmj9uXCyvzxnBhNGmH6iUMUvs-_0HevyhRDv2N7MxT0/pubhtml">summarising its bibliography</a> gets us a median year of 1995 and a mode year 1999. So even ignoring the disproportionately important last ten years, it is a very young field.

        Also called <i>statistical error</i> or <i>random error</i>, but those names are vague to me. I suppose they get called statistical errors because you can use pure stats to detect and control for them, unlike systematic error.

        Writing analysis scripts is much less heavy than real development, where it'd be absurdly expensive to '<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?RollingYourOwnMethodology">roll your own</a>'.
