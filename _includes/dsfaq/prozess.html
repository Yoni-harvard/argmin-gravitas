<h3>A Strange Loop</h3>
<div><br>
	We can also define a data scientist in a black-box manner, as follows:
		<ul>
			<li><b>learner</b>: an inductive program that takes in example data and outputs a model.</li>
			<li><b>model</b>: a deterministic program that takes examples and outputs predictions. </li>
			<li><b>data scientist</b>: a pretentious inductive program that takes a vague problem and data, and outputs a learner.</li>
		</ul><br>
 			
 		That ^ is vague; here's a breakdown of the actual tasks involved:<br>
</div>


<h3>The Data Science Process</h3>
<div>
	<div class="accordion">
		<h3>Domain analysis</h3>	
		<div>What does this vague request really mean?
		
		Metric choice - 	How will we judge success?

		</div>

		<h3>Data collection</h3>	
		<div>	What evidence exists? What can I use?
		</div>

		<h3>Exploratory analysis</h3>	
		<div>	What is the data like? What jumps out?
		</div>

		<h3>Tool choice</h3>	
		<div>	What software suits this task?
		</div>

		<h3>Feature selection</h3>	
		<div>	Which parts are useful?
		</div>

		<h3>Data cleaning</h3>	
		<div>	How to remove flawed data?
		</div>

		<h3>Data wrangling</h3>	
		<div>	How to transform data?
		</div>

		<h3>Modelling</h3>	
		<div>	What structure will answer the question?
		</div>

		<h3>Evaluation</h3>	
		<div>	How good is this model? Under conditions?
		</div>

		<h3>Deployment</h3>	
		<div>	How will this be used? Who will use it?
		</div>

		<h3>Communication</h3>	
		<div>	What result?	
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<h3>Predecessors</h3>
<div>
		Similar roles have been played in the past by jobs like <i>expert system designer, decision support developer, knowledge discovery engineer, predictive analytics guy, business intelligence analyst, data miner, and big data engineer</i>, with varying levels of rigour and bullshit. The <i>quant developer</i>, in finance, is basically the same thing but with far less variance in skill level.
</div>

<h3>Use data science to define data science</h3>
<div>By surveying people with the job title "data scientist" and then clustering the data, Harris et al split "data scientist" into four real jobs:

	<ul>
		<li><i>Data researcher</i>: A postgrad statistician. Writes new algorithms, builds proof-of-concept ensembles, writes analysis libraries, disseminates. </li>
		<li><i>Data developer</i>: Machine learning engineer. Application builder. </li>
		<li><i>Data businessperson</i>: A knowledgeable interface between technical and non-technical people. Doesn’t code: steers modelling approach.</li>
		<li><i>Data creative</i>: Bit of everything. Heavy on visualisations?</li>
	</ul>

	Many, many articles act as if all DS jobs were data researcher jobs; this is the root of the <a href="{{HN1}}">constant</a> HN catfighting about whether you need to know e.g. postgrad linear algebra <i>before</i> starting. (Answer: for data researchers, obviously, and for the others, not so much. Less widespread is the <i>ineliminable</i> need for decent coding skills. Maybe people are taking that as read, but I've seen actual job applications which fail to mention programming once.)
</div>

<h3>Why is the hype happening now?</h3>
<div>
	<ol>
		<li>The underlying cause of most of it is the <a href="{{delug}}">data deluge</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_explosion">explosion</a>) - we collect millions of times more data, basically for free.
		<ul><li>Distributed computing, because the dataset doesn't fit in one computer's RAM.</li>
				<li>Sudden great performance, because it turns out that scaling your sample size gives a qualitative change for some domains (“Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”). Same algorithms <a href="{{backprop}}">as the 80s</a> sometimes!</li>
				<li>huge potential value in scraping and extracting unstructured sources  ->   aggregation</li>
			    <li>Data products (FitBit; restaurants, friends, jobs; credit ratings; health)</li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>(And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_exhaust">the web and IoT</a> are the cause of that.)</li>
		
		<li>Unsupervised machine learning allows for cheap use of the much greater volume of data which isn't.</li>
		
		<li>Cognitive automation: we have recently been able to automate high-level things which used to require skilled humans: trading decisions, recommendations, portfolio allocation, maybe even hypothesis generation: i.e. creativity!</li>

		<li>Demand for real-time summary of datasets means investment in stream processing algorithms and frameworks.</li>
	</ol>

<h3>Do I need a Master's degree to get a data science job?</h3>
<div>
	<a href="http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf">The 2013 O'Reilly survey of self-described data scientists</a> found 70% of respondents holding a Master's. Unless you are highly skilled already, or unless your target company are enlightened, you likely will. <br><br>

	You should be able to start as an analyst and work up though.
