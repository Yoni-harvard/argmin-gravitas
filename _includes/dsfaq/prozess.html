<h3>A Strange Loop</h3>
<div><br>
	We can also define a data scientist in a black-box manner, as follows:
		<ul>
			<li><b>learner</b>: an inductive program that takes in example data and outputs a model.</li>
			<li><b>model</b>: a deterministic program that takes examples and outputs predictions. </li>
			<li><b>data scientist</b>: a pretentious inductive program that takes a vague problem and data, and outputs a learner.</li>
		</ul><br>
 			
 		That ^ is vague; here's a breakdown of the actual tasks involved:<br>
</div>

<h3>Predecessors</h3>
<div>
		Similar roles have been played in the past by jobs like <i>expert system designer, decision support developer, knowledge discovery engineer, predictive analytics guy, business intelligence analyst, data miner, and big data engineer</i>, with varying levels of rigour and bullshit. The <i>quant developer</i>, in finance, is basically the same thing but with far less variance in skill level.
</div>

<h3>Why is the hype happening now?</h3>
<div>
	<ol>
		<li>The underlying cause of most of it is the <a href="{{delug}}">data deluge</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_explosion">explosion</a>) - we collect millions of times more data, basically for free.
		<ul><li>Distributed computing, because the dataset doesn't fit in one computer's RAM.</li>
				<li>Sudden great performance, because it turns out that scaling your sample size gives a qualitative change for some domains (“Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”). Same algorithms <a href="{{backprop}}">as the 80s</a> sometimes!</li>
				<li>huge potential value in scraping and extracting unstructured sources  ->   aggregation</li>
			    <li>Data products (FitBit; restaurants, friends, jobs; credit ratings; health)</li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>(And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_exhaust">the web and IoT</a> are the cause of that.)</li>
		
		<li>Unsupervised machine learning allows for cheap use of the much greater volume of data which isn't.</li>
		
		<li>Cognitive automation: we have recently been able to automate high-level things which used to require skilled humans: trading decisions, recommendations, portfolio allocation, maybe even hypothesis generation: i.e. creativity!</li>

		<li>Demand for real-time summary of datasets means investment in stream processing algorithms and frameworks.</li>

<h3>The Data Science Process</h3>
<div>

	Domain analysis	What does this vague request really mean?
	Data collection	What evidence exists? What can I use?
	Exploratory analysis	What is the data like? What jumps out?
	Tool choice	What software suits this task best?
	Metric choice	How will we judge success?
	Feature selection	Which parts are useful?
	Data cleaning	How to remove flawed data?
	Data wrangling	How to transform data?
	Modelling	What structure will answer the question?
	Evaluation	How good is this model? Under conditions?
	Deployment	How will this be used? Who will use it?
	Communication	What result?	
</div>

<h3>Use data science to define data science</h3>
<div>By surveying people with the job title "data scientist" and then clustering the data, Harris et al split "data scientist" into four real jobs:

	<ul>
		<li><i>Data researcher</i>: A postgrad statistician. Writes new algorithms, builds proof-of-concept ensembles, writes analysis libraries, disseminates. </li>
		<li><i>Data developer</i>: Machine learning engineer. Application builder. </li>
		<li><i>Data businessperson</i>: A knowledgeable interface between technical and non-technical people. Doesn’t code: steers modelling approach.</li>
		<li><i>Data creative</i>: Bit of everything. Heavy on visualisations?</li>
	</ul>

	Many, many articles act as if all DS jobs were data researcher jobs; this is the root of the <a href="{{HN1}}">constant</a> HN catfighting about whether you need to know e.g. postgrad linear algebra <i>before</i> starting. (Answer: for data researchers, obviously, and for the others, not so much. Less widespread is the <i>ineliminable</i> need for decent coding skills. Maybe people are taking that as read, but I've seen actual job applications which fail to mention programming once.)
</div>

<h3>Do I need a Master's degree to get a data science job?</h3>
<div>
	<a href="http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf">The 2013 O'Reilly survey of self-described data scientists</a> found 70% of respondents holding a Master's. Unless you are highly skilled already, or unless your target company are enlightened, you likely will. <br><br>

	You should be able to start as an analyst and work up though.
