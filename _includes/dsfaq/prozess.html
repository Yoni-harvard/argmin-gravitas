<h3>Is it a bullshit fad?</h3>
<div>
		Not exactly. All, and I mean <i>all</i> of its insights come straight out of academic statistics and computer science, and hacker lore. But just because something is made of other things doesn't mean it isn't real, or that it can't be a valuable permutation.<br><br>

		"Data science" is a silly name for a few reasons: because all statisticians apply scientific methods to data, and have done for a hundred years; because all programming is data programming; because the actual job has much more data munging and rote scripting in it than it has experimental science.<br><br> 
</div>

<h3>A Strange Loop</h3>
<div><br>
	We can also define a data scientist in a black-box manner, as follows:<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li><i>learner</i>: an inductive program that takes in example data and outputs a model.</li>
			<li><i>model</i>: a static program that takes examples and outputs predictions. </li>
			<li><i>data scientist</i>: a pretentious inductive program that takes a vague problem and data, and outputs a learner.</li>
		</ul><br>
 			
 		That ^ is vague; here's a breakdown of the actual tasks involved:<br>
</div>


<h3>The Data Science Process</h3>
<div>
	<div class="accordion">
		<h3>1. Domain analysis</h3>	
		<div><i>What does this vague request really mean?</i><br><br>
		<ul>
		<li>Metric choice - 	How will we judge success?</li>
		<li>Tool choice</li>
		<li>Abstraction from business to data</li>
		<li>Abstraction from data to learner and models</li>
		<li>Output type. Real-time?</li>
		</ul>

		</div>

		<h3>2. Data collection</h3>	
		<div>	What evidence exists? What can I use?
		</div>

		<h3>3. Data cleaning</h3>	
		<div>	How to remove flawed data?
		</div>

		<h3>4. Exploratory analysis</h3>	
		<div>	What is the data like? What jumps out?
		</div>

		<h3>5. Feature selection</h3>	
		<div>	Which parts are useful?<br><br>

		Also known as data wrangling or munging.
		</div>

		<h3>6. Modelling</h3>	
		<div>	What structure will answer the question?<br><br>

		The Kaggle bit.<br><br>

		Evaluation - How good is this model? Under conditions?
		</div>

		<h3>7. Deployment</h3>	
		<div>	How will this be used? Who will use it?
		</div>

		<h3>8. Communication</h3>	
		<div>	What result?	
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<h3>Predecessors</h3>
<div>
	Similar roles have been played in the past by jobs like <i>expert system designer, decision support developer, knowledge discovery engineer, predictive analytics guy, business intelligence analyst, data miner, and big data engineer</i>, with varying levels of rigour and bullshit. The <i>quant developer</i>, in finance, is basically the same thing but with far less variance in skill level.
</div>

<h3>Data science to define data science</h3>
<div>By surveying people with the job title "data scientist" and then clustering the data, <a href="{{oreilly}}">Harris et al.</a> split "data scientist" into four real jobs:<br><br>

	<ul>
		<li><i>Data researcher</i>: A postgrad statistician. Writes new algorithms, builds proof-of-concept ensembles, writes analysis libraries, disseminates. </li>
		<li><i>Data developer</i>: Machine learning engineer. Application builder. </li>
		<li><i>Data businessperson</i>: A knowledgeable interface between technical and non-technical people. Doesn’t code: steers modelling approach.</li>
		<li><i>Data creative</i>: Bit of everything. Heavy on visualisations?</li>
	</ul><a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6">6</a><br><br>

	Many, many articles act as if all DS jobs were data researcher jobs; this is the root of the <a href="{{HN1}}">constant</a> <a href="{{HN2}}">HN catfighting</a> about whether you need to know e.g. postgrad linear algebra <i>before starting</i>, let alone before applying.<br><br>

	Answer: data researchers obviously need to; the others, not so much. The <i>ineliminable</i> need is for decent coding skills. Maybe people take that need as too obvious to mention, but I've seen actual DS job applications which fail to mention programming once.
</div>

<h3>Why now?</h3>
<div>
	<ol>
		<li>The underlying cause of most of it is the <a href="{{delug}}">data deluge</a> - we collect millions of times more data, basically for free.
		<ul><li>Distributed computing, because the dataset doesn't fit in one computer's RAM.</li>
				<li>Sudden great performance, because it turns out that scaling your sample size gives a qualitative change for some domains (“Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”). Same algorithms <a href="{{backprop}}">as the 80s</a> sometimes!</li>
				<li>Unprecedented aggregation. Huge potential value in scraping and extracting unstructured sources. Very large market in data. Acxiom is a $1bn company, for just one example; though Google is probably the pre-eminent example.</li>
			    <li>Data products (FitBit; restaurants, friends, jobs; credit ratings; health)</li>
		</ul><br>
		(And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_exhaust">the web and IoT</a> are the cause of that.)</li><br>
		
		<li>Unsupervised machine learning allows for cheap use of the much greater volume of data which isn't annotated with a neat output label (and so can't be used for supervised training).</li><br>
		
		<li>Cognitive automation: we have recently been able to automate high-level things which used to require skilled humans: trading decisions, media recommendations, fine art, maybe even hypothesis generation: i.e. creativity!</li><br>

		<li>Demand for real-time summary of these new datasets means a sudden investment in means investment in stream processing algorithms and frameworks, which were previously not a very efficient use of an industrial computer scientist.</li>
	</ol>
</div>


<h3>Do I need a Master's degree to get a data science job?</h3>
<div>
	<a href="http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf">The 2013 O'Reilly survey of self-described data scientists</a> found 70% of respondents holding a Master's. Unless you are highly skilled already, or unless your target company are enlightened, you likely will. <br><br>

	You should be able to start as an analyst and work up though.
