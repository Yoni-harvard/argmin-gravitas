	<h3>Why should everything be measurable?</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>We are physical; everything that happens to us happens via physics.</li>
			<li>Anything important to us has physical correlates; minimally, in the brain.</li>
			<li>The physical world is measurable, up to <a href="{{planck}}">certain</a> <a href="{{way}}">mostly irrelevant</a> hard limits.</li>
			<li>So anything important to us is measurable, even if indirectly, if noisily, if impractically.</li>

	<h3>Sklar's circle</h3>
	<div>
		<blockquote>
			There is a pattern... in physics that goes like this: First we have some rather vague concept founded in our subjective experience as generated by aspects of our bodily interaction with the physical world...<br>
			<br>
			A way of making this concept more amenable to intersubjective comparison... is the resort to standard measuring instruments that allow us to construct an "objective" surrogate... 
			<br><br>
			At the final stage, the concept becomes integrated into a fundamental physical theory by means of its places in the fundamental laws... 
			<br><br>
			[then] we develop an account of why the measuring instruments that we used at the intermediate stage really were "good"... 
			And we begin to gain at least some insights into how the property characterized by the concept played a role in that initial subjective experience that first brought it to our attention.

		I focus more on the initial cunning initiation of a concept into science, than on the grand systemisation, and then inversion that Sklar describes. (In some circles, "it's not an <a href="{{si}}">SI unit</a>" is an insult - there remains <a href="{{nat}}">some human taint</a>. But the humble <a href="{{scoville}}">Scoville</a> fits my scheme better than the merely deductive bits of SI.)

	<h3>Contingency and necessity</h3>
	<div>
		Note that the standard hierarchy of measurements, Nominal-Ordinal-Ratio-Interval is handy but highly <a href="{{stevens}}">incomplete and actively misleading</a>. Yet it is taught, to millions of stats and social science students a year, as if it was a certain proposition of Euclid, rather than one guy's clever but erroneous half-mathematised philosophy.
