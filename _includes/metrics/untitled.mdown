<a href="{{Spieg}}">David Spiegelhalter</a> has a nice rule of thumb for how much to trust estimates:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>4* : <i>numbers we can believe</i></b>
	<div><blockquote>so accurate than we can, to all intents and purposes, treat them as true</blockquote>.</div>
</li>

<li>
	<b>3* : <i>numbers that are reasonably accurate</i></b>
	<div><blockquote>the figure is probably accurate within a relative Â±25%: a claimed proportion of 12% could actually be anywhere between 9% and 15%</blockquote>.</div>
</li>

<li>
	<b>2* : <i>numbers that could be a long way out</i></b>
	<div><blockquote>Could be anywhere between half and double the given figure. (Proportions should be changed to odds before doubling.)</blockquote></div>
</li>

<li>
	<b>1* : <i>numbers that are unreliable</i></b>
	<div><blockquote>the true figure might be more than double or half what is claimed.<br>
	(On the odds scale, for proportions.)</blockquote></div>
</li>

<li>
	<b>0* : <i>numbers that were just made up</i></b>
	<div><blockquote>Not evidence; negative information. Even odds of having the correct sign.</blockquote></div>
</li>
</ul><br>

(Obviously for some things - pharmacology and space travel come to mind - anything but 4* is unacceptably poor.)
