Julia Galef has <a href="{{Galef}}">a neat taxonomy</a> of ways that books can affect your worldview. Her model is that a book can <br><br>

<ol>
	<li>offer you new Data, or </li>
	<li>Theories to explain data, or </li>
	<li>arguments or scenes aimed at taking on particular Values, or </li>
	<li>an entire Thinking style. </li>
</ol><br>

She also assigns a number 1-5, roughly "Most Concrete -> Most General" for each type.
