	<li>EA safety is small, even relative to a single academic subfield.</li>
	<li>There is overlap between capabilities and short-term safety work.</li>
	<li>There is overlap between short-term safety work and long-term safety work.</li>
	<li>So AI safety is less neglected than a straight accounting of the long-term safety work.</li>
	<li>Also, thereâ€™s a good chance that academia will do more safety over time, eventually dwarfing the contribution of EA.</li>
