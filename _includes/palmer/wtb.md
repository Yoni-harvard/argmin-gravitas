
Many riches. There are constantly five or so subplots on the go, and when one ends it spawns two others. Best are its careful sketches of deep divides: Tradition vs progress, act vs rule, order vs freedom, safety vs optimum return.

Some of the oppositions fall flat because I don't have the requisite respect for the other side. For instance <i>Damnatio memoriae</i> - the official expurgation of someone from history - is presented as an ultimate horror (the pain and execution preceding it is overwhelmingly more important). 
<blockquote>[the damned person is] <i>neither slim nor mighty, stooped nor noble, just a shape... Somewhere in a dusty archive a baptismal registry records some Hildebrand, and, when that dry page molders... I can't look, I can't! Behind the shades, the broad gray plain, that sea of shapeless gloom extending on and on... all forgotten souls, minds empty of memory, smeared one into another... to this absolute dissolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_images_in_the_Soviet_Union" rel="nofollow noopener">Caesar</a> damns his enemies... Not me! I will never let you take me! I will carve my memory into history, by work, by force, by guile, in swathes of blood and ashes if I must!<br /></i></blockquote>

I can admire Palmer's rendition of the old bad legacy code (it has driven quite a lot of history) but I give no part of a real morality. The dead are past caring.

Elsewhere, the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/aura" rel="nofollow noopener">Aura</a> (metaphysical identity) of art is used to devalue perfect replicas of the nuked Coliseum and Forum (which seems like magical thinking to me):<br />
<blockquote>  <i>All false. Our race cannot afford such losses again... On the Acropolis the tears we shed are still tears of connection: where I stand Socrates stood. In the [replica] Roman Forum, by the [replica] Coliseum or the [replica] Patheon, they are regret tears. Replicas cannot touch. That is what we all want, to touch what someone touched, a special someone... whose story reached forward through history...<br /></i>
</blockquote>
Speak for yourself; a perfect simulacrum is enough, though it screams depth to say otherwise. (I'm not actually salty: I love the breadth of ideologies on show here. No doubt someone else will grumble about how thin and unconvincing the utilitarian views presented here are. By writing so many good characters in disagreement, Palmer has passed about <a href="https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html" rel="nofollow noopener">10 Intellectual Turing Tests</a>. )

On the other hand, I feel the horror of true deontology quite keenly:<br />
<blockquote><i>Dominic would happily watch the world burn if he could defile the blasphemer's corpse amid the coals.</i></blockquote>

Much as I like Jedd Mason, his rise to the top of every state - the expressionless, motionless, Spectrumy king of the world - is implausible, even given his mother's scheming; it only makes sense with Intervention. Which is fine, because Palmer is committed to that, but it would still have been nice to have a natural path.

    <h3>Misc</h3>
    <div>
<ul>
  
<li> Achilles is an actual hero here - where in the <i>Iliad</i> he is merely impressively violent. Actually as any fool knows, the ancient heroes are mostly morally small, beneath even us. ("Hero" meant "Big Man", not "saviour".) This is good news, that Achilles (and say Jahweh) are not paragons any more.</li><br>

<li> Miracles happen; Bridger is magical through and through, not even needing a virgin birth. So there was no need for JEDD to be born of woman and Spain. Except that this allows him to be a stark example of Hegelian becoming, which here is the way that God speaks. (And what filth he says.)</li><br>

<li> Next time you complain about how undemocratic your country is, consider: The Mitsubishi here are not only a planned plutocracy, they also have 4 orders of delegated authority: the voters elect representatives who elect representatives who elect representatives who elect the executive.</li><br>

<li> Oh Mycroft. I spent the first book and a half wondering exactly why he is so indispensable, hounded, beloved. This mostly answers it: it's a mixture of macaronic language, dog charisma, and weird athleticism.</li><br>

<li> Nice, surprising bit of anarchism: Hobbestown, the anarchist syndicate, is the 'safest' place in the world. OK, its because of the deterrent of capital punishment but still.</li><br>

<li> A decent portrayal of <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/" rel="nofollow noopener">the burgeoning far-future-focussed ethics</a>, in the otherworldly, post-political, arch-instrumentalist scientists, Utopia. Palmer clearly sympathises with them. One contradiction in her portrayal, though: the Utopians are monomanaical consequentialists, who'll do anything to prevent human extinction or stasis. But they're shown throwing massive resources at trivial uneconomic projects (trivial compared to WMD destruction, space colonization, and terraforming): an underwater city, a city on Antarctica, robots in the shape of mythical beasts. I suppose it's possible this is a PR thing, either to charm or recruit. </li><br>

Their oath actually inspired moral guilt in me, which is hard to do:<br />
<blockquote>
  <i>I hereby renounce the right to complacency, and vow lifelong to take only what minimum of leisure is necessary to my productivity... I will commit the full produce of my labors to our collective effort to redirect the path of human life away from death and toward the stars.<br /></i>
</blockquote>
</li><br>

<li> Palmer knows about a lot of things: Hobbes, evolutionary history, the way a small boat makes waves. Her using this knowledge never felt contrived to me - but again I suspect this is a niche I happen to fall in.<br />
<blockquote>
  <i>The fittest survived, but with the conquered within them, as conquered bacteria became the mitochondria which feed the cells that crawl through volvox, trilobite, and coelacanth toward Mars.</i>
</blockquote></li><br>

<li> It suits me that the psychoanalyst bioconservative Hive choose to be the enemies of the future:<br />
<blockquote>
  <i>"War?" Utopia offered.<br />[the Head Analyst] Felix Faust... accepted the handshake. "War." <br /></i>
</blockquote></li><br>

<li> It's written with a future (C27th?) reader in mind - but then Mycroft explains too much; nothing is taken for granted, and this is obviously on our account, tainting the conceit. </li><br>

<li> Its gender dynamics don't constitute a polemic; instead the Hives' failing utopia shows what most feminist / Critical / international relations theory misses. 'Xenofeminism' (tech-positive, bioprogressive feminism) is a more complete answer to gender harms. But, hearteningly, even mainstream figures <a href="http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Ethics_Aesthetics_and_Animals/Nussbaum_Beyond_Compassion_Part_3.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">like Nussbaum</a> seem to be on board with similar projects: <br />
<blockquote>
  <i>this calls for the gradual formation of a world in which all species will enjoy cooperative and supportive relations with one another. Nature is not that way and has never been. So it calls for the gradual supplanting of the natural by the just.<br /></i>
</blockquote></li><br>

<li> <blockquote><i>A man may leap into the fray in the name of Liberty, Homeland, Human Rights, Justice, but never Economics.</i></blockquote>
(more's the pity)</li><br>

<li> <blockquote>
  <i>If my Saladin is childhood's fear, the unknowable evil in the closet's depths, I have become adulthood's fear, fear of power, law, illustrious contacts, police resources, covert agencies, and sweet judicial murder.</i></blockquote><br /></li><br>

<li> Mycroft's 'death' is immediately subverted by a footnote from him. But then the chapter plays out as if we hadn't seen that footnote, and so it loses most of its emotional charge. This is weird but obviously totally intentional. Twists the twist before the twist can begin. Not sure what's going on - maybe Palmer had tired of doing ordinary twists. (There are a lot of them.)</li><br>
