I didn't understand manga at all before knowing the <b>material conditions</b>: often one chapter per <i>week</i>, low pay, enormous catalogues of copy-paste backgrounds. The author does not know when the series will be cancelled, so it's impossible to plot properly. <i>Shirobako</i> is an anime about the material conditions of anime.<br><br>

It's very important to understand Japanese drawing even if you hate it. It is massive and growing fast. The French government is <a href="{{french}}">currently spending</a> about €200m a year on manga, because they were beautiful and decided to trust French youth with their own cultural spending.<br><br>

Manga is not about virtuoso linework but <a href="/img/cultural/mush.jpg">here are some</a> <a href="/img/cultural/ito.jpg">examples to study</a>. (The background of the latter is a standard library asset.)<br><br>

<b>My gloss</b>: The essence of manga is exaggeration. Men with swords taller than them, preteen superheroes, all kinds of bodies which couldn’t be, all kinds of facial expressions and gesticulations which didn’t exist until they memed themselves into real life. But you can exaggerate anything, it doesn’t have to be combat or sensuality. And the exaggeration tends to take a certain form: self-exaggeration, aspiration, the psychology of becoming excellent. There’s one about being a better chess player, one about being a better baseball player, one about being a better farmer, one about being a better teacher. All treated with high drama, extreme closeups, and OTT declarations. War against one’s own lack of skill and character. 

<!-- So there is nothing inherently surprising about e.g. <i>Barakamon</i>, an exaggerated portrayal of a disgraced calligrapher and his attempt to personalise his art. -->

<!-- Formulaic, exaggerated (and isn't realism superior?) -->
