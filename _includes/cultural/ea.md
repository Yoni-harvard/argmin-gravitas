	<h3>effective altruism</h3>
	<div>


<b>Critics</b>: Toby Ord, Paul Christiano, Nate Soares, David Pearce, Bernard Williams, Larissa Macfarquhar, Angus Deaton, Phil Torres and Amia Srinivasan if you must.<br><br>


<b>Material conditions</b>: We got rich, and so able to help. We got data, and so able to check. We got universalism, and so the will to help.<br><br>

Speculatively: the EA attitude is rare because of scope insensitivity, localism, maybe economic illiteracy, and (justified!) background cynicism about charity and foreign aid.<br><br>


<b>Aims</b>: to make the world as good as possible (whatever that means), using econometrics and philosophy.<br><br>
