	<div>
		We're in luck: around the <a href="{{swine}}">swine flu pandemic</a>, a virologist <a href="{{vir}}">gave many corrections</a> to Barry's descriptions of the virus. They range from nitpicking to raising a real controversy Barry doesn't cover (adaptive virulence shifts). Spirited and somewhat convincing <a href="{{reply}}">reply from Barry here</a>.

	<h3>Why did medicine suck?</h3>
	<div>
		Barry makes at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having "no standards for admission":<br><br>
		<blockquote>
			In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... <br><br>
<!--  -->
			the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. <br />
		</blockquote><br />
<!--  -->
		But Barry's enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins' degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more, <i>before</i> they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. And the requirement is probably one reason the American system is so expensive: we require unbelievably expensive credentials of doctors, and they respond by demanding higher salaries.<br /><br />
<!--  -->
		Perhaps Barry is confusing the schools' open admissions with their appallingly low <i>graduation</i> standards, which were certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope; never used a stethoscope on a patient; never seen a dissection.)

	<h3>Epic</h3>
	<div>
		The book is in the epic mode throughout. (That's not only a compliment.)<br /><br>
		<blockquote>
			Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.<br /><br />
	<!--  -->
			By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.<br />
		</blockquote><br />
		He goes for meditations on epistemology, the modern mind, the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us. I liked it, but it dismays other readers.

	<h3>Why listen to me on this topic?</h3>
	<div>
		<i>Nonfiction book reviews by nonspecialists are hazardous. It is just not easy to detect pseudo-empirical bullshit without<br><br>
			<ol>
				<li>immersion in the field and/or good priors for what makes for an extraordinary claim in it; </li><br>
				<li>incredible amounts of fact-checking gruntwork, at least 5x the time it takes to just read something; or</li><br>
				<li>incredible amounts of argument-checking, which doesn't need domain knowledge, but often involves a lot of interpretive work.</li>
			</ol>
			I always try to do (3) but surely often fail.</i> <br><br><br>
<!--  -->
		In this case, no good reason to trust me. Barry is just a science-adjacent historian, not a scientist, and in his struggle to make a narrative, he fills in quite a lot of emotional colour which is at best vaguely inferred from letters.<br><br> 
		I was glad to see a virologist weigh in, above: his corrections are worrying, since they're pretty fundamental, but limited in scope to a few pages.
