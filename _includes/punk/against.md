Against Me! are a great example of many phenomena that haunt counterculture bands - and tell-me-where-you-live-I-will-gig-in-your-toilet folk-punk most of all. 
<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>a morbid fear of co-option and "selling out" (i.e. of success);</li> 
	<li>the need to sermonize, to confirm one's membership in the unsold-out orthodoxy;</li> 
	<li>snobbery ("fucking radio rock!");</li> 
	<li>a love of <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfop0060/pdf/respects%20and%20levelling%20down.pdf">levelling-down</a>;</li> 
	<li>utterly restricted aesthetic options.</li>
</ul>

AM! lived in a place where "major label debut" means not "the beginning of your pro musical career", but <i>its spiritual end</i>. They got out, though only via the most impressive fanbase alienation of recent years. They went from Crass to blink-182, <a href="http://www.plan-it-x.org/faq/#q6">Plan-it X</a> to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/05/04/warner-music-to-warn.html">Sire</a> (and <a href="https://againstme.myshopify.com/">back to DIY</a>) <br><br>

<!-- Just how hard can you hit an acoustic guitar? Even as young and hardcore as they are, there's "experiment" (compare the structure of this with Crass' "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjJ-y2zMz7Q">G Song</a>" - each beguiling, lonely piano intros followed by thrash). Gabel's vox don't merit the word 'lyrics'; we are excess teen passion. Note that even as early as this EP there's "whoooooah"s and nice unison melody bits. Hey, what if we went quiet <i>and then went loud!</i> -->

I don't want to attack political idealism; why on earth would you?

Why on earth would you attack political idealism? Oh yeah; because it's infested with <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/bookclub/excerpts/006074586X.html">posture</a>, <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/White-People-For-Peace-lyrics-Against-Me/2C04BD02FD0D48A2482572D60016C468">self-importance</a>, <a href="http://www.neufutur.com/Rants/antiagainst.html">intolerance</a> and wilful technical <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080709044054/http://www.fpif.org/pdf/papers/SRtrade2003.pdf">ignorance</a>. As such, large bits of it are an impersonation of a political movement. Lightly-donned, ill-conceived political idealism is a force <i>preserving</i> the status quo: firstly since, in rejecting due process and reform, it ends up achieving nothing; and secondly because, if-and-when it takes up direct action, it alienates most people, who could help change things on grander scales.<br><br>
 
"The personal is political; so, <i>everything is political; </i>and, if you're not making political <i>épater le bourgeois! </i>music then you're a fucking shill. With us or against us. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8moIh_b6wiA">All or nothing</a>."<br><br>

I don't want to attack DIY; why on earth would you? These folk care about financial and artistic autonomy to the point of only needing to break-even from it (if that). These folk freed themselves (and you) of the self-aggrandizing, fifty-foot-high-stage mythology that chokes rock music. Oh yeah; because in hermiting itself off, it disparages most people and the things most people like; demonizes things which actually do good, like trade; and cos it leads to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome">tall-poppy syndrome</a>.

Despite its screamed historical content, this is really about love across political lines. The bassline is pure doo-wop, a simple addition to the long list of punk songs that ignore the "Year Zero" myth and the neurotic rejection of melody.

There's anxious self-consciousness throughout the AM! discography; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Was_a_Teenage_Anarchist">the last single</a> is just the most blatant one. Then there's their getting tired of pretence; sleep (passivity, peace) is another main motif. ("8 Hours", "Turn those Clapping Hands"). This is as should be; making art which is about many things, many brilliant greys.

<br><br>
 
<h2>2003:</h2>

Upon signing to Fat Wreck Chords, though - a successful, famously <a href="http://www.punknews.org/label.php?topic=151">socially progressive</a>, non-corporate, non-<a href="http://techdailydose.nationaljournal.com/2007/10/riaa-wins-big-in-court-faces-c.php">RIAA</a> entity that apparently doesn't bother with contracts - there was ideological blood in the water. <br><br>

<blockquote>
	Disgruntled fans slashed the tires of their tour van in one town and graffitied it in another (scrawling “remember when you mattered” but misspelling “Against”). At a concert in Texas a protest band called Against Us! played in the parking lot outside the club. A writer for Maximum RocknRoll, the grand­daddy of DIY zines, went so far as to issue a fatwa against the band, listing tips readers might find handy for disrupting Against Me! shows (like pouring bleach on their T–shirt table).<br><br> 
	“He came to a show and let off a stink bomb,” Seward says. “We were like, ‘Well, this smells,’ and kept on playing.” Even in a notoriously balkanized subculture, this kind of abuse was over the top..."
</blockquote>
 

By the time the pitchfork-toting scene had proven that they were a self-obsessed deadend packed with snobs - AM! were on their way to Warner. <a href="http://www.punknews.org/article/25078">The singer recently got into some ugliness</a> with a drunk kid angry at their pop music.

The really funny thing is that at no point did they stop being politically radical.

<br><br>
<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Proportion of songs with specifically political lyrics</h3>
	<div>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Vivida Vis:</b> 33% ("In the Name of What?" "National Myth" and "This Is Control")</li>
		<li><b>12" EP:</b> 40% ("I am Citizen" &amp; "All or Nothing")</li>
		<li><b>Acoustic EP:</b> 33% ("Those Anarcho Punks", maybe "Reinventing")</li>
		<li><b>Reinventing Axl Rose:</b> 54% ("Starving", "Jordan's", "Those Anarchos", "Reinventing", "Baby I'm An Anarchist", "8 Hours" sort-of)</li>
		<li><b>Eternal Cowboy</b>: 28% ("Cliche", "Rice and Bread", "Turn those Clapping Hands" - their best)</li>
		<li><b>Former Clarity:</b> 29% (sort-of "Justin", "From Her Lips", "Holy Shit!", "Clarity")</li>
		<li><b>New Wave</b>: 40% ("New Wave", sort-of "Up the Cuts", "White People", "Americans Abroad")</li>
		<li><b>White Crosses</b>: 40% (1, 2, 6, 10)</li>

So it's not <i>lyrical</i> dilution. The last album even calls out old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara#Vietnam_War">Robert McNamara's war crimes</a>, in a massive pop-punk chorus.<br><br>

"Aha!" cries our strawman purist. "But they are <i>politically</i> diluted! Deed over word! <a href="http://www.plan-it-x.org/release/against-me-/crime-as-forgiven-by-/">Look what they did to Plan-it X</a>! In profiteering, they have abandoned DIY!"<br><br>

No. This view is an analogue of admitting that you do not listen to <i>music</i> at all; you listen instead to artists, scenes and Propositions.<br><br>


The backlash against Against Me! is aesthetic. People who reject them for their pop-punk sound and sharp new wardrobe are right in one way - there is no easy way to separate content and style - but dead wrong about the politics of accessible sounds.

It's difficult to pinpoint where they stopped being punk, because I don't care. <i>New Wave</i> and <i>White Crosses </i>are populist, post-emo rock'n'roll bullshit, and a good thing too.

<!-- "Not punk if not only punk."
 -->
<i>New Wave</i> is unpleasantly self-conscious; more than half the album is about the music industry, as if they signed up to Sire just to make a musical report for the underground. Unrepentent too, mind; featuring the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMTiBHUIkz4">tall one out of Tegan and Sara</a>. (And why not.)<br><br>

What is interesting is that they didn't have to mature into pop-punk, the Green-Day-with-a-vocabulary that they did. <i>As the Eternal Cowboy</i>, the first Fat Wreck release, is a bunch of short vignettes that flirt with all kinds of sounds, deciding what to become. There's something that could become great folk. They might yet develop this more oblique stuff, pull more "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wkZGMktFCw">Pints of Guinness</a>".<br><br> 

Even the album's name, "New Wave" is a stuck-out tongue - read it as "replacement of punk" the parvenu pop that "co-opted" punk in the 80s... And, with hindsight, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searching_for_a_Former_Clarity">2005 album title</a> is another sly one.

Profound cheese; specific Springsteen; wordy Weezer; marxist My Chemical Romance. (For once the music video really adds - that massive grin at 3:11...) <br><br>

Where does someone's right to prefer ignorance end? I don't know - but <a href="{{blender}}">slashing someone's tyres</a> for wanting to make slightly different music says a lot about you.<br>
