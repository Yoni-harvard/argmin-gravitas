		An interminable question among punk fans is when punk started, who counts as the pioneer, who counts as the precursors. 
		<br><br>
		<!--  -->
		Well, the sound of "Year Zero" 1976 <a href="{{zero}}">wasn't new</a>: the incompetent <a href="{{monk}}">garage rockers</a> and <a href="{{neu}}">a couple of</a> the 'Kraut' rockers of the late 60s sounded exactly the same as the New Yorkers and Londoners of the late 70s. <a href="{{tv}}">Television</a> (1973-1978) get tagged as both a proto-punk and a post-punk band: simultaneously before and after, influence and pre-emptive successor. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>

		<br><br>
		The alliance of pop music and political radicalism wasn't new - consider all the <i>actual</i> social experimentation by the (hated, derided, 'soft') <a href="{{counter}}">hippies</a>. The hippies did <a href="{{carol}}">pirate radio</a> and <a href="{{whole}}">DIY</a> and zines. The hippies <a href="{{stone}}">actually fought</a> the police en masse, not just at gigs. The largest-scale punk practice, the <a href="{{house}}">Punk House</a> or squat is just a tiny wee co-op commune, the sort of thing <a href="{{comm}}">tried for hundreds of years</a>, and the earliest examples are tied to Andy Warhol. <br><br>
		<!--  -->
		Even compared to other subcultures, punk is unusually closely tied to its music and fashion. Are there punks who don't like punk rock, who don't like patches and studs? Not many. What we call a counterculture is a vague mix of subversive aesthetics, politics, and lifestyles. Sometimes it's principled, and sometimes it is just about the thrill of being contrary, of 'countersignalling'.<br><br>
		<!--  -->
		The punk look was kinda new, but really just a stronger form of <a href="{{greas}}">greaser</a> and <a href="{{mod}}">hard mod</a> style. 
		<br><br>
		Nihilism and anti-establishment art is <a href="{{russ}}">very old</a>. And even the punks would have known about the <a href="{{angry}}">aggressively negative art</a> of 50s England.
		<br><br>
		What was novel about punk was not its content or its form, but its reception: nasty music at the top of the charts, all kinds of <a href="{{mes}}">weirdos</a> on TV with major label contracts, and a permanent change to the available palette of pop music.<br><br> 
		What <i>is</i> novel about punk is its longevity: a radical arty youth movement of the mid C20th which did not lose all of its adherents, only most of them, and which continues to recruit from every new generation of contrary individualist teenagers.

	<!-- <h3>The aesthetic</h3>
	<div>
		A quick way to get up to speed on the aesthetic is Wikipedia's list of punk <a href="{{bands}}">band names</a> ("Teenage Jesus and the Jerks", "the Vibrators", "the Lunachicks", "the Meat Puppets", "Black Flag/White Flag/Anti-Flag", "Vegan Reich").

	<h3>Fashion movement that became political, or vice versa?</h3>
	<div>
		<br>
		<blockquote>
			I was messianic about punk, seeing if one could put a spoke in the system in some way
		</blockquote>

		<br><br>
		Another common talking point is "<a href="{{fash}}">fashion punks</a>": the superficial apolitical poseurs who dilute or co-opt the true scene.
		<br><br>
		You can guess what I'm going to say here: this is a perfect inversion of the origins of punk, among NY art schoolers and <a href="{{viv}}">literal avant-garde haute couture</a> (haut-en-bas). (Anti-fashion is still fashion: have you <i>seen</i> any catwalks lately?)
		<br><br>
		<a href="{{sid}}">Sid Vicious</a> wore a swastika to shock, while out on the town with his Jewish girlfriend; <a href="{{ss}}">he wasn't an outlier</a>. Maybe half of Misfits songs are about murder, rape, paedophilia, abduction, mind control, body horror, cannibalism. Insincerity was there from the start. Larping extremism.
		<br><br>
		No restriction on the "taste" of your lyrical content (nuclear terror, foetal meals, Hakenkreuz) but authoritarian restriction on style.
		<br><br>
		<!--  -->
		"Fashion" is probably too narrow: this kind of punk was shock art, instances from all media.

	<h3>Why did early punk seem political?</h3>
	<div>
		I think it's people mistaking official documents as a complete picture of 70s culture. Punk really did challenge a couple of dull British institutions: TV and radio were very clean and tightly controlled; but <i>people</i> never have been all that clean and controlled.
		<br><br> 
		It's now hard to imagine a Western government <a href="{{ban}}">banning pop music</a>, but it wasn't long ago. Everyone <i>is</i> an unlicenced radio station now, via Youtube or podcasting or whatever.<br><br>
		An analogy: people look at photographs of Victorians and see stiff joyless people. But <a href="{{vic}}">this is a mistake</a>, two mistakes: you had to hold extremely still for a long time to get the exposure to come out without blurring, and the people in the photographs are disproportionately upper-class and thus unusually mannered.
		<br><br>
		Punk <i>needed</i> official disdain to feel relevant. Outside the west, it is quite often <a href="{{burm}}">subject</a> to oppression far beyond what the original American and British punks underwent.

	<h3>What is ideology anyway?</h3>
	<div>
		The most common use is for "a political view I don't like". <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>
		<br><br>
		Here I only mean "ideology" in the new neutral sense of 'a set of political beliefs'. (Whereas Marxists and politicians use it as an insult.)
	</div>
	<!--  -->
	<h3>Anti-politics</h3>
	<div>
		<a href="{{minogue}}">Some people</a> define "politics" as "collective, negotiated use of power" - and in this sense, while anarchism (and fascism) is a form of <i>government, </i>it is not a form of <i>politics</i>.
		<br><br> 
		Even late, post-80s punk is anti-political in one sense: it avoids existing social mechanisms like democracy or lobbying or <a href="{{ad}}">markets</a>. It is difficult and thankless to work within the system as a punk - if you succeed in changing something, then you will have failed, by becoming part of the establishment.

And the idea of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jello_Biafra#Presidential_campaign">punk politician</a> feels paradoxical, just a <a href="{{prez}}">stunt</a>.

	<h3>Punk intellectuals</h3>
	<div>
		Punk as ideology has no central texts. If it has scripture, manifestos, intellectuals, then most punks haven't read them. <a href="{{roll}}">Bizarrely</a>, <i><a href="{{jello}}">lectures</a></i> are a main unit of discourse, besides of course the vague lyrics and ephemeral zines. But everyone is a self-publisher now. (I'm kind of out of the loop now, so I don't know whether punk on the internet thrived after zines declined. From the outside it doesn't look like it.)
