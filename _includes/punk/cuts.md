<br><br>While I'm being academic about it: the following recognises only one rough temporal distinction (1970s fashion vs C21st counterculture) and focusses on the Chomskyist, ineffectual, teenage Punk of Britain, America, Australia, rather than the capital-R resistance in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/17/punk-rock-state-oppression-burma">Indonesia</a>, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/rotten-vicious-times-burma-s-punk-scene-fights-repression-underground-a-817185.html">Burma</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_rock#Late_1970s_and_1980s">Chile</a>, etc.<br>
<br><br>

Punk crawled out of an aesthetic in 1970s New York art and London fashion. As such, and despite the <a href="http://www.furious.com/PERFECT/situationism.html">namedropping</a> Malcolm McLaren might have made to the contrary, it was basically apolitical. But whether it originally was or not, it has been <i>taken to be</i> a political movement, and when you have this much social energy surrounding something, being is less important than becoming. (I use "pun<b>x</b>" below for the personal-political, dressing-up/ spitting/ crusty/ amoral side of things, which overlaps only somewhat with the political formulation.) Throughout, I resist abstracting the Punk Ideal from Punk Rock music, mostly because it's very barren to me without that engine, that cresting noise.<br>
<br>

Even if you grant its evolution into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_social_movements">New Social Movement</a>, you might still deny that punk is genuinely political, call it <i>antipolitical, </i> <br> -->

<span style="font-size: 130%;">IDENTIFIABLE STRAINS</span><br>
<ol>
<li><b>DAFFY</b> - see James quote above; this is punk as <i>prank music</i>, an inept, energetic and democratic <a href="http://www.luckyvitamin.com/p-10943-fountain-of-youth-technologies-doctors-libido-lift-contains-tongkat-ali-180-capsules">fountain of youth</a>. Politics never was a necessary condition. (Out of the hundreds of songs that quintessential punk band The Ramones recorded, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3mOWp13GMM">only one or two</a> can at all be described as political.)<b><br>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li><b>FASHION / NIHILIST</b> - Up the Punx - see Appendix (Can be <a href="http://nancys.110mb.com/nancy_Richard%20Hell.htm">intellectualized</a>, but it's no politics.<br></li>
<li><b>RATIONALIST</b> - Po-faced progressives. (e.g. <a href="http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/4073/the_margin_walker/">Ian MacKaye</a>, <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/08/greg-graffin-punkrock-phd.html">Greg Graffin</a>, Terry Eagleton, Suzanne Moore)<b><br>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li><b>ANARCHO</b> - Radical as it gets. (e.g. <a href="http://www.onoffyesno.com/">Penny Rimbaud</a><b>)</b><b> &amp; or FEMINIST</b> - (<a href="http://onewarart.org/riot_grrrl_manifesto.htm">Riot grrl</a>)</li>
</ol>
<br>
The following applies to the last two. The appendix applies to the nihilistic (2).<br>
<br>
<br>
If I were more radical in an orthodox way, I suppose I'd resent even political punk for being hollow and distracting; for being childish and unrigorous. As it is, I just have grudging respect for its utopianism and an addiction to the sounds it has thrown up.

<span style="font-size: 130%;"><b>APPENDIX: ON PUNX</b> </span></div>
<br>
Here's where the stereotypes of thuggery and idiocy come from: this is Punk as post-hippie aesthetic. It primarily trades in on Cold War kids' fear, anger, alienation. A self-centred, rebel disaffection - and an adjective: "he's so punk rock". <br>
<br>
<br><br>



<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1jKHfOdSZhQ/TITuf7XZjSI/AAAAAAAAASg/yU_O9L_zHHI/s1600/queen.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1jKHfOdSZhQ/TITuf7XZjSI/AAAAAAAAASg/yU_O9L_zHHI/s400/queen.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5513794076087520546" style="display: block; height: 198px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 293px;" /></a><br>


<br>
A telling episode in the style is the release of Bad Religion's second album <i>Into the Unknown. </i>They had built a fanbase in the fast basic hardcore scene, but <span style="font-style: italic;">ItU</span> is a big cheap proggy thing, and not bad at all <i>if you're not looking for a punk record.</i> <br>
<br>
Whatever intellectual aspirations BR might have had towards punk being somehow about <i>freedom, </i>somehow about real individualism, were sunk when the extent of hostility and mockery became clear. More or less all of the first and only pressing was recalled.<br>

 To the point of ignoring legitimate difference.

<!-- * <i> Anti-globalization</i><br>
Anger, often vague, about the linked phenomena that are assumed to be limited to corporate conglomeration, labour outsourcing, tax evasion, economic unaccountability and all that. I say <i>anti </i>rather than the continental label, '<i>alter-</i>mondialisation' because most Brits miss the point: that there are many globalisations and the one where foreign music and history and places are more accessible than they have ever ever been is also globalisation. There are very, very few arguments that can counterweight <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2009$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL%5Fn5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=295;dataMax=79210$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=19;dataMax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=">this more or less conclusive, more or less inspiring</a> piece of research. <br> -->
