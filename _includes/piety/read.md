<big>7. Reading, the moral and spiritual necessity of.</big><br>

The sharpest tooth in the bunch, for me. The news piety is a special case of this, I suppose. And half the internet one, too. How often do you feel insecure about having not read a Portentous Classic? How often do you lie about having read them? <br>

<i>The element of truth</i>: Reading is incredible, a telepathic link from the best thinkers. A handful of small, as-yet-unfalsified studies find <a href="{{empathy}}">an increase in empathy</a> from reading.
<br><br>
<i>The error enforced</i>: That reading <i>anything</i> will do: <a href="{{insta}}">form</a> over content. That it offers unique benefits, when many people just don't need the reminder to have perspective or empathy or whatnot.

		Only satirical attacks on reading seem to be possible:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11799527">Alain de Botton hopes</a> that his children don't have to read, because reading is a "response to anxiety", and thus a bad sign.</li>
		<li><a href="http://afterallitcouldbeworse.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/might-reading-harm.html">Me</a> dissembling.</li>
		<li>Mikita Brottman likens it to masturbation and challenges the edification side, but then snaggle-pusses sideways saying that both are good 'self-explorations' anyway.

		<li><a href="http://www.identitytheory.com/the-case-against-reading/">Steven Johnson</a> trying to make videogames look good.</li>
		<li><a href="http://nymag.com/arts/books/reviews/39578/">Pierre Bayard's happy satire</a>. But even his mouthpiece fails to criticise reading properly:
		<br><blockquote>The books we love offer a sketch of a whole universe that we secretly inhabit, and in which we desire the other person to assume a role.<br><br>
		One of the conditions of happy romantic compatibility is, if not to have read the same books, to have read at least some books in common with the other personâ€”which means, moreover, to have non-read the same books. From the beginning of the relationship, then, it is crucial to show that we can match the expectations of our beloved by making him or her sense the proximity of our inner libraries.</blockquote></li>

(I myself am pious about this, failing to really even hypothetically attack it.)
