<big>6. Higher education.</big><br>

<i>The element of truth</i>: Ideas are important. Four years of relative freedom at the beginning of adulthood is fantastic. There's a lot more to life than economics. It will be hard to replicate the deep internationalism and the universal parental and governmental approval in alternative spaces. Research and cultural transmission are important and gain greatly from local networking.

<i>The error enforced</i>: That <i>going to university</i> has inherent value (rather than the skill, knowledge, perspective which unreliably attend students' attendance). That this inherent value justifies giant personal debt and diversion of public spending (from, e.g. <a href="{{ubi}}">the economic emancipation of all</a>). That it's <i>university</i> that provides an intellectual or spiritual boost, rather than exposure to ideas, rigour, and peer discussion - each of which are tending towards being free, outwith the academy. That institutional learning is best learning. That you need credentials to be <a href="{{cred}}">credible</a>. 

The driver of disastrous trends: the one by which more jobs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credentialism_and_educational_inflation">arbitarily require more degrees</a>; the one where a degree is a hollow class marker and networking tool rather than anything to do with (resented, quickly forgotten) knowledge or culture.

		<li>This scene in Good Will Hunting is the only mainstream statement of the nonspecialness of university:
		<blockquote>Will: See, the sad thing about a guy like you is, in 50 years you're gonna start doin' some thinkin' on your own and you're going to come up with the fact that there are two certainties in life: one, don't [wield academia to humiliate people], and two, you dropped 150 grand on a fuckin' education you coulda got for a dollar-fifty in late charges at the public library!</blockquote></li>
