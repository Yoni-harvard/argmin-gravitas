<big>1. Following the news.</big><br>


<i>The element of truth</i>: What good is reading the news? It's important to try to understand stuff. People act badly in the absence of oversight; the powerful act even worse.
<br>

<i>The errors enforced:</i> 'News is a good way of understanding the world'; <br>'a newspaper is representative of events';<br> 'news is a guide to what's really (causally) important in the world';<br> 'newsreading is a necessary condition of showing concern or solidarity with the world'.
<br>

<i>How widespread is it?</i> Trying to find evidence for any of the pieties is annoying: after all, these just are things that slip past critical notice. <a href="{{med}}">60% of UK adults</a> are on the stuff daily. The last <a href="{{baro}}">Eurobarometer</a> found 87% of people watching TV every day, 89% of them watching the TV news, so let's fudge this as 80%. (They may well be inflating their attentiveness, but this lip service serves my point and so is not actually statistical bias at all.)<br>


<i>What's the objection?</i> The <a href="{{always}}">permanent</a> state of the media: sensationalist, rushed, oversimplified, unscientific, <a href="{{acc}}">unaccountable</a>. Most people know that you shouldn't believe the likes of the <i><a href="{{inq}}">National Inquirer</a></i>. But <a href="{{stud}}">one study</a> found that 80% of '<a href="{{qual}}">quality</a>' British journalism has been <a href="{{chur}}">a false journalism</a>, copied and pasted from PR sources. Even stories that aren't compromised by their propaganda origins are subject to irrational pressures, <a href="{{over}}">oversimplification</a> to <a href="{{bal}}">false balance</a> to <a href="{{gold}}">statistical</a><a href="{{ill}}"> illiteracy</a>. Unanalysed reporting is <a href="{{pla}}">plausibly worse</a> than no information. You never forget the first time you see a completely-invented quote attributed to you in an article.<br>

Epistemics aside, I also have a much calmer inner life since I stopped reading news. The only time the omission has  affected me at all, in 8 years, is the <a href="{{gat}}">Gatwick drone cockup</a>.

We might reserve the word 'journalism' for the real kind: public third-party investigation of the powerful when they stray. We need journalism in this limited sense, and we <a href="{{deb}}">probably</a> need <i>a</i> mass media to push the result - if only to scare powerful groups into behaving well. <br>

That would make my abstention <a href="{{free}}">free-riding</a>, a bad thing. But real, <a href="{{llll}}">long-form</a>, book-grade investigative journalism is rare, edged out by clickbait. And actually-existing journalists with their awful incentives are not up the task. Reporting is (or should be) a kind of rapid social science, much harder than other social sciences because it can so rarely wait and think.<br>
