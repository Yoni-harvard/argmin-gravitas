<big>5. The internet</big><br>

Because it contains a good and growing representation of the world entire, this is a hard thing to be properly against. (You might manage it by being depressed to fuck, or anti-technology in general. But that degree of Luddism probably entails being against <a href="https://www.icheme.org/media_centre/news/2014/drinking-water-petrol-and-antibiotics-top-poll-of-best-inventions.aspx#.VXCrd89VhBc">most</a> social progress.) So I have to rename this 'technological utopianism' if it is to have any real bite. (Though note <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/03/internet-knowledge.aspx">this</a> research programme.)

<i>The element of truth</i>: <a href="http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ky7o5wP5ZS1qaiudzo1_500.jpg">Knowledge</a>, obvs. And the self-creation it enables is <a href="http://www.gwern.net/The%20Melancholy%20of%20Subculture%20Society">probably good</a> for all kinds of people.
<br>

<i>The error enforced</i>: That the uses of abstractions on network protocols are inevitably progressive. That politics has changed fundamentally.
