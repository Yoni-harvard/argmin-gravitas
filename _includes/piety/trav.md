<big>2. Travel</big><br>

Even quite level-headed people have a hyper-inflated view of the intellectual and spiritual benefits of travelling. It is hard to find anyone any more than grumpy about a particular trip, or snobby about the way others travel. The hype of going places is not <a href="{{gran}}">at all new</a>. But the modern practice - mass, international, touristic - has holidays as the centre and peak of your year. It is the safest conversational topic outside of the weather.<br>

<i>The element of truth</i>: There are still a lot of different ways to live, and many experiences that don't come across in print. I suppose compulsive xenophobes are the only really principled anti-travellers.
<br>

<i>The errors enforced</i>: The possibility of fleeing yourself. Mere sensation as sufficient for understanding. In poverty tourism: the <a href="{{virt}}">superior virtue</a> of the oppressed. For the cost of three weeks in Japan you _could_ buy the 150 best-ever books on Japan, or the best 50 books plus 10 of the best Japanese meals in your home country (etc). You would come out of this knowing different things from your alter ego, but not obviously worse things. (Then there's the sleep cost and the illnesses.)
<br>

Claimed benefits:
<ul>
	<li> broaden your sense of possibility, </li>
	<li>jolt you out of your received notions, </li>
	<li> force you to try new things, </li>
	<li> force you to look at the world anew</li>
	<li>serendipity, all the things that people don't write down.</li>
</ul>

_Stationary_ travel (going to one location and really getting to know it for months) can deliver the benefits promised of normal travel, the sub-week consumption of surfaces. But all of the above can be achieved from any location, with a bit of mental footwork. My estimate is that people get about one serendipitous thing every two weeks away. (If you count getting mugged or malaria as serendipity, which I do.)


<i>How widespread?</i> 78% of rich-world people plan to this year (<a href="{{rich}}">p.20 here</a>). 91% of Britons</a> polled by Ipsos.<br>

				Martha Gellhorn is a funny example, since she spent her whole life travelling. But with open eyes: 
				<blockquote>One needs Equanil here too, not just in our white urban civilisation; tranquilisers against impatience, against the hysteria induced by heat, and the disgust at dirt...</blockquote>

			<li>Emerson: 
				<blockquote> I have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe, for the purposes of art, of study, and benevolence... But he who travels to be amused, or to get somewhat which he does not carry, travels away from himself... He carries ruins to ruins. Travelling is a foolâ€™s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from... <br /><br />Our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home.</blockquote></li>

				<a href="https://danfrank.ca/a-response-to-julia-galef-and-herbert-simon-on-travel/">Dan Frank</a> actually tries to defend travel relative to an equal spend on remote learning, which is an improvement over the usual. He makes some nice points, but the strong, open, understanding-based kind of travel he defends is still incredibly rare.
