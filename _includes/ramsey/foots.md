		He had actually started a year earlier, which is ridiculously impressive anyway. <br>

		Paul Samuelson tells a even more false but much more fun version of this story:
		<blockquote>...on his first day as an undergraduate at Cambridge, Ramsey met with his philosophy tutor Ogden, and started to discuss some of his own ideas about essence and being. After listening, Ogden said, “These notions are rather like those of Kant.” <br>
		“Kant? Who is he?” <br>
		“Immanuel Kant was the author of this book I’ll lend you, 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft'.” <br>
		“But it’s in German, sir, and I don’t know any German.” <br>

    	A quick comparison to the yardstick of mind, John von Neumann.<br><br>

		He didn't agree that it was great, let alone the greatest. Writing out his theory in full "<i>would, I think, be rather like working out to seven places of decimals a result only valid to two</i>".
