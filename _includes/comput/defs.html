<h3>"Automatically"</h3>
<p class="def">
	Acting without external intervention, after specifying input and program. I'm treating this as the core property of 'a computer'. An abacus is not a computer, because it doesn't do any operations for you. The Ishango bone, as far as anyone can tell, is also not a computer. A slide rule makes you do the intermediate steps and so isn't a computer. <br>
</p>


<h3>"Calculator"</h3>
<p class="def">
	A distinction is sometimes made between computers and mere calculators. For instance, Zuse's Z3 is sometimes said to be an '<a href="{{calc}}">electronic calculator</a>', and not a computer per se. This distinction does not have a physical basis. <br><br>

	I think their point is to make universal computation a necessary condition of being 'a computer' - but this condition would disqualify archetypal computers like the ABC and Colossus. So it doesn't fit. <br><br>

	For my purposes, a calculator is a computer: a special-purpose (arithmetic) computer. So we can talk about the ancient analogue devices and Babbage's inspired flight of general-purpose imagination in the same article.
</p>


<h3>"Programmable"</h3>
<p class="def">
	Can you change what it computes, without altering the gross structure of the processor?<br><br>

	I think the word "programmable" is sometimes used to mean "general-purpose". Actually GP computers are a subset of programmable computers: they're the ones that can be programmed to do '<a href="{{computable}}">anything</a>'.<br><br> 

	(Even worse, "Program-controlled" is sometimes used to mean punch-card or plug-wire programming, as opposed to "stored-program-controlled", for instance regarding the 	Z3 <a href="{{flow}}">here</a>.)
</p>


<h3>"General-purpose"</h3>
<p class="def">
	This is one of the vaguest terms. I have contorted it to mean: If the device had unlimited memory (and time), could it simulate a <a href="{{utm}}">Universal Turing machine</a>; could it compute all that can be computed?
