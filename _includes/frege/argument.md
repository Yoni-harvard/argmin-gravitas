	<li>A (Fregean) concept is a boolean function: `f(x) -> {T,F}`.</li>
	<li>All statements including numbers contain an assertion about a concept.</li>
	<li>Number is the concept 'the extension of the concept of an equinumerosity relation'. The number equivalent to a concept `f` will be the extension of the concept equinumerous with `f`. </li>
	<li>A logical condition for numbers: numbers are equivalent when they have the same size extension</li>
	<li>Abstract to equivalence classes</li>
	<li>Define zero, one & the successor function via extension (to generate the natural numbers)</li>
	<li>Define extension with only logical concepts (to prove that number is purely logical); </li>
	<li>Derive the axioms of arithmetic (to prove that Peanoâ€™s axioms are purely logical).</li><br>
