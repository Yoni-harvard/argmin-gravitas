Other people have attacked <a href="{{Schoolsout}}">schools</a>, <a href="{{Ruined}}">ancient ruins</a>, and <a href="{{Unabomb}}">mid-level science professors</a>. We can conclude that <i>everything is controversial to someone</i>. We could do better than this if we had a way to measure controversy.

First, what is "tractability"?<br><br><br>

<p style="padding-left:10%"><span style="font-weight: bold;">tractability</span>: how easy something is to solve - for instance, how much can <br>you get done for a given amount of money?</p><br>

My question is <i>How can we get a good number to represent the size of a political controversy?</i> The conflict that comes with controversy is a large drag on what you can get done (tractability). (It's a particularly big problem for anything which wants to use government resources.)<br><br>

Consider giving out free birth control in a highly religious country. <br><br>

The tractability of doing good by giving out birth control depends on: the cost of buying and shipping and how easy it is to get evidence about the disease situation and your own operation against them. (Evidence like how well similar work has gone, and or how easy it is to track results.) 

But it also depends heavily on social factors like controversy and conflict. So tractability numbers obtained without at least trying to guess these factors is shaky - "asocial", you could call it. 

It's not all bad. A positive social factor would be the reputation and social connections of the people giving out the condoms. This can be guessed by things like "number of politicians known", but really it is itself a hidden factor - one which you might use the efficiency of previous work to guess.  <br><br>

Conflict causes delays, extra costs (for lawyers, negotiators, marketers, security, and insurance), and might reduce the number of people willing to use the product, or to volunteer. This all reduces efficiency and tractability.<br><br>

One result of conflict is direct action: e.g. people actively working against your medicine drop. As well as inspiring direct action against your medicine drop, controversy would also make politicians and other organisations less likely to help you.<br><br>

We can make a first guess at what controversy 'really is' by saying "take the size of the group that is against condom distribution, and add a multiplier for the extent to which their government is to be involved with the plan".<br><br>

In later versions you'd want to take account of the media's role in spreading controversy and fake controversy, and of how weird the goal is among recipients. (For instance, acting to reduce the suffering of animals in the wild is weird in every country in the world, except maybe parts of Tibet.)

<br><br>

This is no doubt an incomplete picture, and it's hard to measure basically every factor mentioned. But the value of getting imperfect guesses could still be high, especially if the work can't be done in an uncontroversial way (e.g. if we tried to get a law passed).

<h3>Things to find out</h3>

I’m not sure how to put a value on setting a good example (in the face of popular opposition), compared to the straightforward model where you only count the direct effects of your actions. I’m not sure how much moral weight we should give to people getting annoyed by our helping others - especially since we are only getting a rough measure of their actual annoyance, through how they express their disapproval. I’m not sure how to separate people being annoyed by 1) work on a cause, 2) a particular action towards that cause, and 3) the people taking the action.<br><br>

I am not sure how much weight to put on particular cases of controversy and overcoming it, relative to a machine that guesses the present situation based on social media data. I’m not sure how well Twitter chatter really suggests real opposition.
