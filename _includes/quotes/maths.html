<li><i>...und dann bedürfte es immer noch jenes ausgespannten Himmels von heller, boshafter Geistigkeit, welcher von Oben herab dies Gewimmel von gefährlichen und schmerzlichen Erlebnissen zu übersehn, zu ordnen, in Formeln zu zwingen vermöchte. </i> 
<br><br>(even then you will have need of the all-encompassing heavens, with their bright, malicious spirituality, to allow you to survey this swarm of dangerous and painful experiences, order them, and force them into formulae.)<br>
&#8211; Nietzsche</li> <br><br>



<li><i>Mathematics is a hard thing to love. It has the unfortunate habit, like a rude dog, of turning its most unfavourable side towards you when you first make contact with it: arithmetic... It is the best wilderness in which to retreat, to fast, to search for enlightenment. It is, paradoxically, about the only place where you can really take refuge from the modern world&#8217;s unrelenting barrage of numbers. But only mathematicians, and the various subspecies and half-breeds thereof, go there...</i>
<br>&#8211; David Whiteland</li> <br><br>



<li><i>...perhaps research in its purest form is more like chasing squirrels. As soon as you spot one and leap towards it, it darts away, zigging and zagging, always just out of reach. If you&#8217;re a little lucky, you might stick with it long enough to see it climb a tree. You&#8217;ll never catch the damned squirrel, but chasing it will lead you to a tree.<br><br> 
In mathematics, the trees are called theorems. The squirrels are those nagging little mysteries we write at the top of many sheets of paper. We never know where our question will take us, but if we stick with it, it&#8217;ll lead us to a theorem. That I think is what research ideally is like.</i>

<li><i>J'aimais et j'aime encore les mathématiques pour elles-mêmes comme n'admettant pas l'hypocrisie et le vague, mes deux bêtes d'aversion.</i><br>
(I used to love mathematics for its own sake, and I still do, because it allows for no hypocrisy and no vagueness, my two bêtes noires.)
<br>&#8211; Stendhal</li> <br><br>



<li><i>Outside observers often assume that the more complicated a piece of mathematics is, the more mathematicians admire it. Nothing could be further from the truth. Mathematicians admire elegance and simplicity above all else, and the ultimate goal in solving a problem is to find the method that does the job in the most efficient manner...</i>
<br>&#8211; Keith Devlin</li> <br><br>



<li><i>When a student works on a mathematical problem, he comes to a stage beyond which he does not know how to proceed, and where he is in doubt or perplexity. As long as he has this doubt, he cannot proceed. If he wants to proceed, he must resolve this doubt. And there are ways of resolving that doubt. Just to say &#8220;I believe&#8221;, or &#8220;I do not doubt&#8221;, will certainly not solve the problem. To force oneself to believe and to accept a thing without understanding is political, and not spiritual or intellectual.</i>
<br>&#8211; Walpola Rahula</li> <br><br>



<li><i>Compare mathematics and the political sciences &#8212; it&#8217;s quite striking. In mathematics, in physics, people are concerned with what you say, not with your certification. But in order to speak about social reality, you must have the proper credentials, particularly if you depart from the accepted framework of thinking. Generally speaking, it seems fair to say that the richer the intellectual substance of a field, the less there is a concern for credentials, and the greater is the concern for content.</i><br>
&#8211; Noam Chomsky</li> <br><br>




<li><i>They find the language richer than its bare content; what is translated comes to mean less to them than the logic and style of saying it; and from these overtones grows mathematics as a literature in its own right.

Pure mathematics is a form of poetry which has the same relation to the prose of practical mathematics as poetry has to prose in any other language. The delight of exploring the medium for its own sake.</i><br>
&#8211; Jacob Bronowski</li> <br><br>


<li><i>It is insufficient to protect ourselves with laws; we need to protect ourselves with mathematics.</i><br>
&#8211; Bruce Schneier</li> <br><br>



<li><i>I can best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of a journey through a dark unexplored mansion. You enter the first room of the mansion and it's completely dark. You stumble around bumping into the furniture but gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is. Finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch, you turn it on, and suddenly it's all illuminated. You can see exactly where you were. Then you move into the next room and spend another six months in the dark. So each of these breakthroughs, while sometimes they're momentary, sometimes over a period of a day or two, they are the culmination of , and couldn't exist without, the many months of stumbling around in the dark that proceed them.</i><br>
&#8211; Andrew Wiles</li> <br><br>



<li><i>We must remember that, strictly speaking, "formal" does not mean merely "rigorous", but "according to form". Meaning need be ascribed only to the result of a formal process. It is not needed to guide the process itself. We ascribe meaning to intermediate formal states primarily, nay solely, to reassure ourselves.</i><br>
&#8211; Guy Steele</li> <br><br>


<li><i>Mathematics, however, is, as it were, its own explanation; this, although it may seem hard to accept, is nevertheless true, for the recognition that a fact is so is the cause upon which we base the proof.</i><br>
&#8211; Girolamo Cardano</li> <br><br>



<li><i>The proof</i> [of the existence of an infinity of prime numbers] <i>is by reductio ad absurdum, and reductio ad absurdum, which Euclid loved so much, is one of a mathematician&#8217;s favourite weapons. It is a far finer gambit than any chess gambit: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game.</i><br>
&#8211; GH Hardy</li> <br><br>


<li><i>Poincaré concluded that the axioms of geometry are conventions, our choice among all possible conventions is guided by experimental facts, but it remains free and is limited only by the necessity of avoiding all contradiction. Thus it is that the postulates can remain rigorously true even though the experimental laws that have determined their adoption are only approximative. The axioms of geometry, in other words, are merely disguised definitions.</i><br>
&#8211; Robert Pirsig</li> <br><br>


<li><i>Maxwell&#8217;s talk of a large number of systems, instead of a continuous one, was a characteristic way of expression of a physicist who tends to see the infinite as an approximation to the sufficiently large finite. (A mathematician might think exactly the other way around.)</i><br>
&#8211; John von Plato</li> <br><br>



<li><i>What could be more general than 2, which can represent two galaxies or two pickles, or one galaxy plus one pickle (the mind doth boggle), or just 2 gently bobbing &#8212; where? It, like God, is an &#8220;I am&#8221; and many have thought that it must be a precipitate of ultimate reality.</i><br>
&#8211; Alfred W. Crosby</li> <br><br>



<li><i>&#8220;I count a lot of things that there&#8217;s no need to count,&#8221; Cameron said. &#8220;Just because that&#8217;s the way I am. But I count all the things that need to be counted.&#8221;</i><br>

<li><i>More and more I&#8217;m aware that the permutations are not unlimited.</i><br>
&#8211; Russell Hoban</li> <br><br>


<li><i>Still more recently has it been found that the good Bishop Berkeley&#8217;s logical jibes against the Newtonian ideas of fluxions and limiting ratios cannot be adequately appeased in the rigorous mathematical conscience, until our apparent continuities are resolved mentally into discrete aggregates which we only partally apprehend. The irresistible impulse to atomize everything thus proves to be not only a disease of the physicist; a deeper origin, in the nature of knowledge itself, is suggested.</i><br>
&#8211; J. Larmor</li> <br><br>



<li><i>Reasoning and logic are to each other as health is to medicine, or &#8212; better &#8212; as conduct is to morality. Reasoning refers to a gamut of natural thought processes in the everyday world. Logic is how we ought to think if objective truth is our goal &#8212; and the everyday world is very little concerned with objective truth... The very reason we need logic at all is because most reasoning is not conscious at all.</i><br>
&#8211; Julian Jaynes</li> <br><br>



<li><i>The object of mathematical rigor is to sanction and legitimate the conquests of intuition, and there never was any other object for it.</i><br>
&#8211; Jacques Hadamard</li> <br><br>



<li><i>Eine Menge ist ein Vieles, das sich selbst als Eins denken läßt.<br></i>
(A set is a Many that allows itself to be thought of as a One.)</i><br>
&#8211; Georg Cantor</li> <br><br>



<li><i>Set theory has a dual role in mathematics. In pure mathematics, it is the place where questions about infinity are studied. Although this is a fascinating study of permanent interest, it does not account for the importance of set theory in applied areas. There the importance stems from the fact that set theory provides an incredibly versatile toolbox for building mathematical models of various phenomena.</i><br>
&#8211; Jon Barwise and Lawrence Moss</li> <br><br>



<li><i>Mathematics... is concerned with a wider domain than that domain which it is the object of the natural sciences to describe and categorize. The natural sciences are concerned with the actual world. Mathematics is concerned with &#8220;all possible worlds&#8221;.</i><br>
&#8211; David Malet Armstrong</li> <br><br>



<li><i>&#8230;the membership relation for sets can often be replaced by the composition operation for functions. This leads to an alternative foundation for Mathematics upon categories &#8212; specifically, on the category of all functions. Now much of Mathematics is dynamic, in that it deals with morphisms of an object into another object of the same kind. Such morphisms (like functions) form categories, and so the approach via categories fits well with the objective of organizing and understanding Mathematics. That, in truth, should be the goal of a proper philosophy of Mathematics.</i><br>
&#8211; Saunders Mac Lane</li> <br><br>



<li><i>Nowadays, one of the most interesting points in mathematics is that, although all categorical reasonings are formally contradictory, we use them and we never make a mistake. Grothendieck provided a partial foundation in terms of universes but a revolution of the foundations similar to what Cauchy and Weierstrass did for analysis is still to arrive. In this respect, he was pragmatic: categories are useful and they give results so we do not have to look at subtle set-theoretic questions if there is no need. Is today the moment to think about these problems? Maybe &#8230;</i><br>
&#8211; Pierre Cartier</li> <br><br>



<li><i>If, like the truth, falsehood had only one face, we should know better where we are, for we should then take the opposite of what a liar said to be the truth. But the opposite of the truth has a hundred thousand shapes and a limitless field.</i><br>

<li><i>Whatever you have to do with a structure-endowed entity Σ try to determine its group of automorphisms &#8230; You can expect to gain a deep insight into the constitution of Σ in this way.</i><br>
&#8211; Hermann Weyl</li> <br><br>



<li><i>&#8220;&#8230; I think in a line &#8212; but there is the potentiality of the plane.&#8221; This perhaps was what great art was &#8212; a momentary apprehension of the plane at a point in the line.</i><br>
&#8211; Charles Williams</li> <br><br>



<li><i>When a pattern shows itself in tiles or in your mind and says, &#8216;This is the mode of my repetition; in this manner I extend myself to infinity&#8217;, it has already done so: it has already been infinite; the potentiality and the actuality are one thing. If two and two can be four then they actually are four, you can only perceive it, you have no part in making it happen by writing it down in numbers or telling it out in pebbles.</i><br>

<li><i>Mathematics never reveals man to the degree, never expresses him in the way, that any other field of human endeavour does: the extent of the negation of man&#8217;s corporeal self that mathematics achieves cannot be compared with anything... Here I will say only that the world injected its patterns into human language at the very inception of that language; mathematics sleeps in every utterance, and can only be discovered, never invented.</i>

<li><i>On sighting mathematicians [poetry] should unhook the algebra from their minds and replace it with poetry; on sighting poets it should unhook poetry from their minds and replace it with algebra.</i>
<br>&#8211; Brian Patten</li> <br><br>


<li><i>Of the properties of mathematics, as a language, the most peculiar one is that by playing formal games with an input mathematical text, one can get an output text which seemingly carries new knowledge. The basic examples are furnished by scientific or technological calculations: general laws plus initial conditions produce predictions, often only after time-consuming and computer-aided work. One can say that the input contains an implicit knowledge which is thereby made explicit. One could try to find a parallel in the humanities by comparing this to hermeneutics: the art of finding hidden meanings of sacred texts. Legal discourse, too, has some common traits with scientific discourse. In the course of history, the modern language of science slowly emerged from these two archaic activities, and it still owes a lot to them, especially in the more descriptive and less mathematicised domains.</i>
<br>&#8211; Yu. I. Manin</li> <br><br>



<li><i>&#8220;The study of mental objects with reproducible properties is called mathematics.&#8221; I love this definition because it doesn&#8217;t try to limit mathematics to what has been called mathematics in the past but really attempts to say why certain communications are classified as math, others as science, others as art, others as gossip. Thus reproducible properties of the physical world are science whereas reproducible mental objects are math. Art lives on the mental plane (the real painting is not the set of dry pigments on the canvas nor is a symphony the sequence of sound waves that convey it to our ear) but, as the post-modernists insist, is reinterpreted in new contexts by each appreciator. As for gossip, which includes the vast majority of our thoughts, its essence is its relation to a unique local part of time and space.</i>
<br>&#8211; David Mumford</li> <br><br>


<li><i>the ocean of mathematical understanding just keeps monotonically rising, and we’ve seen it reach peaks like Fermat’s Last Theorem that had once been synonyms for hopelessness.  I see absolutely no reason why the same ocean can’t someday swallow P vs. NP, provided our civilization lasts long enough.  In fact, whether our civilization will last long enough is by far my biggest uncertainty. </i>
<br>&#8211; Scott Aaronson</li> <br><br>


<li><i>To exist (in mathematics), said Henri Poincaré, is to be free from contradiction. But mere existence does not guarantee survival. To survive in mathematics requires a kind of vitality that cannot be described in purely logical terms.</i>
