	<li><blockquote><i>...however true </i>[your claim]<i> may be, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth...

	<li><blockquote><i>There are no subject matters; no branches of learning - or, rather, of inquiry: there are only problems, and the urge to solve them. A science such as botany or chemistry is, I contend, merely an administrative unit... even serious students are misled by the myth of the subject. And I should be reluctant to call anything that misleads a person a convenience to that person.</i></blockquote>

	<li><blockquote><i>the rules of right reason... ought to be contained in Logic; but the actual science of Logic is conversant at present only with things either certain, impossible, or </i>entirely<i> doubtful, none of which (fortunately) we have [available] to reason on. Therefore the </i>true<i> Logic for this world is the Calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the </i>magnitude<i> of the probability (which is, or which ought to be, in a reasonable man's mind).</i></blockquote>
	&#8211; James Clerk Maxwell</li>
	<br><br>

	<li><blockquote><i>However unwillingly a person who has a strong opinion may admit the possibility that his opinion may be false, he ought to be moved by the consideration that however true it may be, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth.

	<br /><br />Where [dogmatists'] influence prevails, they make it nearly impossible for the received opinion to be rejected wisely and considerately, though it may still be rejected rashly and ignorantly; for to shut out discussion entirely is seldom possible, and when it once gets in, beliefs not grounded on conviction are apt to give way before the slightest semblance of an argument. 

	<br /><br />This is not knowing the truth. Truth, thus held, is but one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which enunciate a truth.</i></blockquote>&#8211; JS Mill</li>
	<br /><br />


	<li><blockquote><i>If the cultivation of the understanding consists in one thing more than in another, it is surely in learning the grounds of one's own opinions.

	<li><blockquote><i>my whole education, in and out of school, seemed... to pivot around the word "nevertheless"... the word of final justification...

	<li><blockquote><i>We feel an affinity with a certain thinker because we agree with him; or because he shows us what we were already thinking; or because he shows us in a more articulate form what we were already thinking; or because he shows us what we were on the point of thinking; or what we would sooner or later have thought; or what we would have thought much later if we hadn&#8217;t read it now; or what we would have been likely to think but never would have thought if we hadn&#8217;t read it now; or what we would have liked to think but never would have thought if we hadn&#8217;t read it now.</i></blockquote>&#8213; Lydia Davis</li>

	<li><blockquote><i>... if we laugh with derision, we will never understand. Human intellectual capacity has not altered for thousands of years. If intelligent 	people invested intense energy in issues that now 	seem foolish to us, then the failure lies in our understanding of their world, not in their distorted perceptions. Even the standard example of ancient nonsense - the debate about angels on pinheads - makes sense once
	you realize that theologians were not discussing whether five or eighteen would fit, but whether a pin could house a finite or an infinite number.</i></blockquote>&#8213;  Stephen J. Gould</li>
	<br /><br />


	<li><blockquote><i>the things people believe are usually just what they instinctively feel is right; the justifications, the things you're </i>supposed<i> to argue about, come later. They're the least important part of the belief. That's why you can destroy them, win an argument, prove the other person wrong, and still they believe what they did in the first place. You've attacked the wrong thing.</i></blockquote>

	<li><blockquote><i>The essence of Christianity is told to us in the Garden of Eden history. The fruit that was forbidden was on the Tree of Knowledge.
