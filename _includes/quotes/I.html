	<li>Mantra: <i>One</i>, what are they saying? <i>Two</i>, are they telling the truth? <i>Three</i>, does their reasoning follow? <i>Four</i>, what are they missing out? <i>Five, or, zero</i>: why are they writing about this at all? </li>

	<li><em>To be right, be vague. To be productively wrong, be precise.</em></li>

    <li><i>Efficiency is just constructive laziness.</i><br>

	<li><i>Trust criticism in proportion to the direct quotation in it.</i></li>

	<li>Treat fools differently to assholes &#8211; and almost everyone is more fool than asshole.</li>
	<br /><br />

	<li><i>Economics</i>: It is prohibitively hard to change people. It always depends. Things fall apart, but sometimes into place too. People aren't stupid. Most things fail. Sometimes there is no right answer. You are the system.</li>

	<li><i></i>I don't love economics; I hate bad economics.</li>
