	<li><i>A picture is worth 10,000 words - but only those used to describe the picture. Hardly any sets of 10,000 words can be adequately described with pictures</i></li><br>

	<li><i>Every program is a part of some other program and rarely fits.</i></li><br>

	<li><i>Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.</i></li><br>

	<li><i>In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be reborn.</i></li><br>

	<li><i>Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon bra and fig-leaf.</i></li><br>

	<li><i>The best book on programming for the layman is "Alice in Wonderland"; but that's because it's the best book on anything for the layman.

	<li><i>If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.</i></li><br>

	<li><i>
	Every program has (at least) two purposes: the one for which it was written, and another for which it wasn't.</i></li><br>

	<li><i>
	Wherever there is modularity there is the potential for misunderstanding: Hiding information implies a need to check communication.</i></li><br>

	<li><i>
	To understand a program you must become both the machine and the program</i></li><br>

	<li><i>
	One can only display complex information in the mind. Like seeing, movement or flow or alteration of view is more important than the static picture, no matter how lovely.</i></li><br>


	<li><i>Once you understand how to write a program get someone else to write it.</i></li><br>

	<li><i>Some cathedrals took a century to complete. Can you imagine the grandeur and scope of a program that would take as long?</i></li><br>

	<li><i>The goal of computation is the emulation of our synthetic abilities, not the understanding of our analytic ones.</i></li><br>

	<li><i>Because of its vitality, the computing field is always in desperate need of new cliches: Banality soothes our nerves.</i></li><br>
	<li><i>In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living definition of the word "frustration".</i></li><br>
	<li><i>Computation has made the tree flower.</i></li><br>
	<li><i>One can't proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.</i></li><br>
	<li><i>Within a computer natural language is unnatural.</i></li><br>
