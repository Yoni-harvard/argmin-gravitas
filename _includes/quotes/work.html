A diversified multi-cultural, post-modern deconstruction that is anatomically and ecologically incorrect.

A cutting edge, state-of-the-art bi-coastal multi-tasker and I can give you a gigabyte in a nanosecond!     I&#8217;m new wave, but I&#8217;m old school and my inner child is outward bound. I&#8217;m a hot-wired, heat seeking, warm-hearted cool customer, voice activated and bio-degradable.

I&#8217;m a hands-on, foot-loose, knee-jerk head case pretty maturely post-traumatic and I&#8217;ve got a love-child that sends me hate mail.<br><br>     But, I&#8217;m feeling, I&#8217;m caring, I&#8217;m healing, I&#8217;m sharing-- a supportive, bonding, nurturing primary care-giver.

I read junk mail, I eat junk food, I buy junk bonds and I watch trash sports! I&#8217;m gender specific, capital intensive, user-friendly and lactose intolerant.<br><br>     I like rough sex.
