<blockquote>
	Someone might say I have only made a bouquet of other people's flowers, supplying nothing of my own but the thread to bind them... <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a><br><br>

	But, if you embrace the opinions of [others] through reason, they will no longer be their opinions, they will be yours too... Truths are held in common by all, and no more belong to those that uttered them first than to him that repeats them later. It's no more 'according to Plato...' than 'according to me...', since he and I both understand it. <br><br>

	Bees plunder flowers, but they do so after honey, which is afterwards all theirs; it is no longer thyme or marjoram. So too with parts borrowed from others: you transform and mingle them, and so make a work entirely yours - namely, your judgment. <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>
