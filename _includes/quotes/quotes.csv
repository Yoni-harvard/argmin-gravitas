John's world is a world of ideas, a world in which ideas don't belong to anyone, and in which, when an idea is wrong, just the idea – not the person – is wrong. A world in which ideas are like young birds, and we catch them and proudly show them to our friends... Some people won't show you the birds they've caught until they are positive that they – the birds, or themselves – are gorgeous, or rare, or remarkable. When your mind can separate yourself from it, you will share it sooner, and the beauty of the bird will be sooner enjoyed.	Richard Gabriel

At every single stage [of processing information] — from its biased arrival, to its biased encoding, to organizing it around false logic, to misremembering and then misrepresenting it to others — the mind continually acts to distort information flow in favor of the usual goal of appearing better than one really is.	Robert Trivers	
I believe there is no philosophical high-road in science, with epistemological signposts. No, we are in a jungle and find our way by trial and error, building our road behind us as we proceed.	Max Born	
If error is corrected whenever it is recognised, the path of error is the path of truth.	Hans Reichenbach	
There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.	Leonard Cohen	
Writing: store knowledge in a brain-independent form that can be easily replicated, transmitted and preserved.<br><br>Mathematics: constructing abstract systems, reasoning about them precisely and finding connections between them.<br><br>Science: finding abstract systems which map closely to the real world.The reason why we teach these in schools to everyone everywhere is that they are part of your cultural inheritance as a human.

Recently a fourth major tool was added to the list: <br>Computing: arranging inanimate systems to simulate arbitrary abstract systems	Jamie Brandon	
Killing ideas is a necessary part of science. Think of it as community service.	Sabine Hossenfelder	
Reading and experience train your model of the world. And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists. Your mind is like a compiled program you've lost the source of. It works, but you don't know why.	Paul Graham	
If falsehood had only one face, as the truth does, we'd know where we were: we could take the opposite of what a liar said to be the truth. But the opposite of the truth has a hundred thousand shapes and a limitless field.	Montaigne	
Seek not the paths of the ancients; seek what they sought.	Matsuo Bashō	
Books must follow science, and not science books.	Francis Bacon	
...the reason human beings could not reject ideas because they were bad: Ideas on Earth were badges of friendship or enmity. Their content did not matter. Friends agreed with friends, in order to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with enemies, in order to express enmity.	Kurt Vonnegut Jr	
Virtue the only nobility, reason the only authority.	the Enlightenment	
Much of the wisdom of the world is not wisdom, and the most illuminated class of men are no doubt superior to literary fame, and are not writers.	Emerson	
The line between cynicism and misanthropy — between thinking ill of human motives and thinking ill of humans — is often blurry. So we want readers to understand that although we may often be skeptical of human motives, we love human beings (many of our best friends are human!).	Hanson and Simler	
...however true [your claim] may be, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth... Truth, thus held, is but one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which enunciate a truth.	JS Mill	
Your denial of the importance of objectivity amounts to announcing your intention to lie to us. No-one should believe anything you say.	John McCarthy	
There are no subject matters; no branches of learning - or, rather, of inquiry: there are only problems, and the urge to solve them. A science such as botany or chemistry is, I contend, merely an administrative unit... even serious students are misled by the myth of the subject. And I should be reluctant to call anything that misleads a person a convenience to that person.	Karl Popper

Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do. 	Donald Knuth	
The history of science, like the history of all human ideas, is a history of irresponsible dreams, of obstinacy, and of error.	Karl Popper

Those who will not reason, are bigots, those who cannot, are fools, and those who dare not, are slaves.	George Gordon Byron	
It is a profoundly erroneous truism... that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.	Alfred North Whitehead

...when told by his pupil, Elizabeth Anscombe, that it was easy to understand why people thought the sun went round the earth, Wittgenstein asked, &quot;Why would they think that?&quot;<br> &quot;Well,&quot; said Anscombe, &quot;it looks that way.&quot; To which Wittgenstein replied, &quot;And how would it look if the earth went round the sun? 		
You will object to me: what good are classes, genera, systems! I answer you: Order and simplification are the first steps toward mastery of a subject — the actual, terrible enemy is the unknown.	Thomas Mann

But in our enthusiasm, we could not resist a radical overhaul of the system, in which all of its major weaknesses have been exposed, analyzed, and replaced with new weaknesses.	Bruce Leverett	
A conclusion is simply the place where someone got tired of thinking. 	Arthur Bloch?	
Reasoning and logic are to each other as health is to medicine, or &#; better &#; as conduct is to morality. Reasoning refers to a gamut of natural thought processes in the everyday world. Logic is how we ought to think if objective truth is our goal &#; and the everyday world is very little concerned with objective truth... The very reason we need logic at all is because most reasoning is not conscious at all.	Julian Jaynes	
Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him. It is a gift for dealing with the accidents of existence, not the accidents themselves.	Aldous Huxley	
the need to get things done often leaves us no leisure for careful inquiry, so we must confess that the life of a man is often obnoxiously in error about particular matters; we must acknowledge our infirmity.	René Descartes	
Once Da'an asked Master Baizhang, &quot;This student yearns to understand enlightenment. What is it?&quot;The Master said, &#;You are like someone searching for an ox while riding that ox.&#;	after Baizhang Huaihai

Time burns, but leaves no ashes.	Elsa Triolet	
However unwillingly a person  who has a strong opinion may admit the possibility that his opinion may be false, he ought to be moved by the consideration that however true it may be, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth.  Where [dogmatists'] influence prevails, they make it nearly impossible for the received opinion to be rejected wisely and considerately, though it may still be rejected rashly and ignorantly; for to shut out discussion entirely is seldom possible, and when it once gets in, beliefs not grounded on conviction are apt to give way before the slightest semblance of an argument.  This is not knowing the truth. Truth, thus held, is but one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which enunciate a truth.	JS Mill	
A theory is a machine for answering a class of questions. 	Judea Pearl	
If the cultivation of the understanding consists in one thing more than in another, it is surely in learning the grounds of one's own opinions. Whatever people believe, on subjects on which it is of the first importance to believe rightly, they ought to be able to defend against at least the common objections.	JS Mill	
All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility. Its condemnation may be allowed to rest on this common argument, not the worse for being common.	Mill	
When will we realise that the fact that we can become accustomed to anything... makes it necessary to examine everything we are accustomed to?	GB Shaw	
We feel an affinity with a certain thinker because we agree with him; or because he shows us what we were already thinking; or because he shows us in a more articulate form what we were already thinking; or because he shows us what we were on the point of thinking; or what we would sooner or later have thought; or what we would have thought much later if we hadn&#;t read it now; or what we would have been likely to think but never would have thought if we hadn&#;t read it now; or what we would have liked to think but never would have thought if we hadn&#;t read it now.	Lydia Davis	
The effort to understand the world is one of the few things that lifts human life a little above the level of farce and gives it some of the grace of tragedy.	Steven Weinberg	
Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking. 	Einstein	
Beware the man of one book. 	Thomas Aquinas	
I worry about it in the same way I worry about the philosophical Problem Of Skepticism. I don’t think I’m a brain in a vat. But I’m vaguely annoyed by knowing that an actual brain in a vat would think exactly the same thing for the same reason. 	Scott Alexander	
... if we laugh with derision, we will never understand. Human intellectual capacity has not altered for thousands of years. If intelligent people invested intense energy in issues that now seem foolish to us, then the failure lies in our understanding of their world, not in their distorted perceptions. Even the standard example of ancient nonsense - the debate about angels on pinheads - makes sense once you realize that theologians were not discussing whether five or eighteen would fit, but whether a pin could house a finite or an infinite number. 	Stephen Jay Gould	
Here's a way to tell scientific intelligence from legal intelligence. Both may start from the idea that something cannot be done and think up arguments to explain why. However, the scientist may discover a flaw in the argument that leads him change his mind and to discover a way to do it... The legal thinker will merely try to patch the flaw in the argument, because, once he has chosen a side, all his intelligence is devoted to finding arguments for that side.	John McCarthy	
The essence of Christianity is told to us in the Garden of Eden history. The fruit that was forbidden was on the Tree of Knowledge. The subtext is, &quot;All the suffering you have is because you wanted to find out what was going on. You could be in the Garden of Eden if you had just kept your fucking mouth shut and hadn't asked any questions.&quot;	Frank Zappa	
A good stack of examples, as large as possible, is indispensable for a thorough understanding of any concept, and when I want to learn something new, I make it my first job to build one. 	Paul Halmos	
No idea is above scrutiny; no people are beneath dignity. 	Maajid Nawaz	
You must hasten - not only because you are daily nearer to death, but also because your intellect, which enables you to know the true nature of things and to order all your actions by that knowledge decays too, and may cease first.	Marcus	
Somebody has to do something, and it's just incredibly pathetic that it has to be us.	Jerry Garcia	
Every day I recall that my outer and inner life rests on the labours of others, the living and the dead; so I must strive, to give back, in the same measure, what I received and still receive. 	Einstein	
When some portion of the biosphere is rather unpopular with the human race - a crocodile, a dandelion, a stony valley, a snowstorm, an odd-shaped flint - there are three sorts of human being who are particularly likely still to see point in it and to befriend it. They are poets, scientists and children. Inside each of us, representatives of these three groups can be found.	Mary Midgley

...Compassion for the cancer patient, for the bereaved parent, for the victim of famine.  Compassion for the undocumented immigrant facing deportation.  Compassion for the LGBT man or woman dealing with self-doubts, ridicule, and abuse.  Compassion for the nerdy male facing suicidal depression because modern dating norms, combined with his own shyness and fear of rule-breaking, have left him unable to pursue romance or love.  Compassion for the woman who feels like an ugly, overweight, unlovable freak who no one will ask on dates.  Compassion for the African-American victim of police brutality.  Compassion even for the pedophile who’d sooner kill himself than hurt a child, but who’s been given no support for curing or managing his condition.  This is what I advocate.  This is my platform.	Scott Aaronson	
The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognized that the number of legs, the villosity of the skin... are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose they were otherwise, what would it avail? The question is not &quot;Can they reason?&quot; nor &quot;Can they talk?&quot; but &quot;Can they suffer?&quot;	Jeremy Bentham

It is vain to do with more what can be done with less. 	William of Ockham	
'Man is weak - he must receive a task which accords to his strength,&quot; people say. This amounts to:&quot;My hands are weak; I cannot draw a straight line, and therefore, in order to make it easier for myself, though I wish to draw a straight line, I will take a curved or a broken line as my guide.&quot; The weaker my hand is, the more perfect must my guide be.	Lev Tolstoy	
For evil to triumph, all that is required is for good men to respond rationally to incentives.	Misha Gurevich	
The better is the enemy of the good.	Voltaire	
If only there were evil people somewhere, insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?	Alexander Solzhenitsyn	
For the sake of one word a man is judged wise or foolish. Take care in choosing your words. 	Confucius	
Boredom is a vital problem for the moralist, since at least half the sins of mankind are caused by the fear of it.	Bertrand Russell

We live during the hinge of history. Given the scientific and technological discoveries of the last two centuries, the world has never changed as fast.

All other things have a limited and fixed nature prescribed and bounded by our laws. You, with no limit or no bound, may choose for yourself the limits and bounds of your nature. We have placed you at the world's center so that you may survey everything else in the world. We have made you neither of heavenly nor of earthly stuff, neither mortal nor immortal, so that with free choice and dignity, you may fashion yourself into whatever form you choose. To you is granted the power of degrading yourself into the lower forms of life, the beasts, and to you is granted the power, contained in your intellect and judgment, to be reborn into the higher forms, the divine.&quot;<br>...

[Lord], make me chaste – but not yet.	Augustine of Hippo	Existence
A man who sets out to justify his existence and his activities has to distinguish two different questions. The first is whether the work which he does is worth doing; and the second is why he does it... The first question is often very difficult, and the answer very discouraging... It is a tiny minority who can do something really well, and the number of men who can do two things well is negligible. If a man has any genuine talent he should be ready to make almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate it to the full.	GH Hardy	Existence
there's nothing problematic about going out to shop for some soap or a car and purchasing the best that happens to be available... But some things, like the person you're going to spend the rest of your life with, or the work you'll spend it doing, don't seem like this. We want to believe in having a calling and a soulmate.<br> ...here, in the gap between what we think we want and what we think we can get, the phenomenon occurs. It goes by many names: evil; marketing, sales, recruitment, courtship... Whatever one calls it, it would be advisable to think at least twice before concluding that one is better off ignoring it, the whole impetuous fearful flurry of flowing down gradients: to wonder, to inquire, to guess, to experiment, to tell and to listen... To offer, and reject, and reject, and reject; to seek, and be rejected, and rejected, and rejected.<br><br>...who among us can be said to have lived the most plausible facsimile of the chimerical &quot;good life'? ...lovers cradling one another on the beach, murmuring the three words that are the highest expression of what they mean to each other:&quot;Markets in everything.&quot;	Zack Davis	Existence
There are always some human beings who live to be a hundred. More do so today than ever before, but there have always been some... It comes as a shock to realise that the whole of civilisation has occurred within the successive lifetimes of sixty people&#;which is the number of friends I squeeze into my living room when I have a drinks party. Twenty people take us back to Jesus, twenty-one to Julius Caesar.	Bryan Magee	Existence

Don't just read it, fight it! ... Jump ahead, try the next problem, turn the page, go to the next chapter, or even abandon the book and start another one. Books may be linearly ordered, but our minds are not. 	Paul Halmos	Maths
If, stranger, you're able to find out these things and gather them in your mind, giving all their relations, then you'll be crowned with glory and know you are perfect in this species of wisdom. 	Archimedes	Maths
When you have mastered numbers, you will in fact no longer be reading numbers, any more than you read words when reading books. You will be reading meanings. 	Harold Geneen	Maths
It was pretty far into my mathematics education that I realised: one of the reasons mathematics always seems to have all the answers was that the teachers were the ones choosing the questions. 	Ben Millwood	Maths
'When am I going to use this?'... [but] mathematics is not just a sequence of computations to be carried out until your stamina runs out... Those are to mathematics as weight training and calisthenics are to soccer... you won’t see anybody on the field curling a weight or zigzagging between traffic cones. But you do see players using the strength, speed, insight, and flexibility they built up by doing those drills, week after tedious week... 	Jordan Ellenberg	Maths
道生一;一生二; 二生三; 三生萬物.  	Laozi	Maths
even then you will have need of the all-encompassing heavens, with their bright, malicious spirituality, to allow you to survey this swarm of dangerous and painful experiences, order them, and force them into formulae.  	Nietzsche	Maths
Physics is the science of determining which subset of mathematics the universe respects. 	John Schilling	Maths
Abstractness, sometimes hurled as a reproach at mathematics, is its chief glory and its surest title to practical usefulness. It is also the source of such beauty as may spring from mathematics. 	Eric Temple Bell	Maths
you learn algebra in calculus, calculus in differential equations, differential equations in mechanics... 	Proverb	Maths
The shortest path between two truths in the real domain passes through the complex domain. 	Jacques Hadamard	Maths
...mathematics is distinguished from all other sciences except only ethics, in standing in no need of ethics. Every other science, even logic, especially in its early stages in danger of evaporating into airy nothingness... spun from the stuff that dreams are made of. There is no such danger for pure mathematics; for that is precisely what mathematics ought to be. 	Charles Peirce	Maths
Mathematics is purely hypothetical: it produces nothing but conditional propositions. 	Charles Peirce	Maths
The study of mathematics is apt to commence in disappointment....We are told that by its aid the stars are weighed and the billions of molecules in a drop of water are counted. Yet, like the ghost of Hamlet's father, this greatest science eludes the efforts of our mental weapons to grasp it. 	Alfred North Whitehead	Maths
Any impatient student of mathematics or science or engineering who is irked by having algebraic symbolism thrust upon him should try to get along without it for a week. 	Eric Temple Bell	Maths
The [hard approach to learning maths] is to try to understand everything so thoroughly as to become a part of it. In technical terms, they try to grok mathematics. For example, I often hear of people going through some foundational textbook forcing themselves to solve every exercise and prove every claim &quot;left for the reader &quot; before moving on... but for all one's desire to grok mathematics, mathematicians don't work like this! The truth is that mathematicians are chronically lost and confused. It's our natural state of being, and I mean that in a good way... So, dear reader aspiring to grok linear algebra or calculus or any mathematical subject, I suggest you don't worry too much about verifying every claim and doing every exercise. If it takes you more than 5 or 10 minutes to verify a &quot;trivial &quot; claim in the text, then you can accept it and move on... What's much more useful is recording what the deep insights are, and storing them for recollection later. Because every important mathematical idea has a deep insight, and these insights are your best friends. They're your mathematical &quot;nose &quot;, and they'll help guide you through the mansion.	Kun	Maths
...randomized algorithms, with their 10^-200 probability of error, are only good enough for non-mission-critical applications, like air traffic control or diagnosing cancer or monitoring a nuclear reactor... not for publishing a theorem in a math journal.	Scott Aaronson	Maths
Mathematics is a hard thing to love. It has the unfortunate habit, like a rude dog, of turning its most unfavourable side towards you when you first make contact with it: arithmetic... It is the best wilderness in which to retreat, to fast, to search for enlightenment. It is, paradoxically, about the only place where you can really take refuge from the modern world&#;s unrelenting barrage of numbers. But only mathematicians, and the various subspecies and half-breeds thereof, go there... 	David Whiteland	Maths
...people think &quot;mathematicians have been working for hundreds of years and now there's tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of mathematicians all spending every day working on problems so how could you possibly still find a simple down-to-earth problem that hasn't already been studied, you know, way too much?&quot; And the answer is: those problems aren't rare at all, they keep coming up several times a year, and this is an example where even this very basic problem of rectangle into rectangles has all kinds of, sort of, stones not yet turned. 	Don Knuth	Maths
...perhaps research in its purest form is more like chasing squirrels. As soon as you spot one and leap towards it, it darts away, zigging and zagging, always just out of reach. If you&#;re a little lucky, you might stick with it long enough to see it climb a tree. You&#;ll never catch the damned squirrel, but chasing it will lead you to a tree. <br>In mathematics, the trees are called theorems. The squirrels are those nagging little mysteries we write at the top of many sheets of paper. We never know where our question will take us, but if we stick with it, it&#;ll lead us to a theorem. That I think is what research ideally is like. 	Terry Gannon	Maths
I used to love mathematics for its own sake, and I still do, because it allows for no hypocrisy and no vagueness, my two bêtes noires. 	Stendhal	Maths
[skipping passages]... should be done whenever a proof seems too hard, or whenever a theorem or a whole paragraph does not appeal to the reader. In most cases he will be able to go on, and later he may return to the parts which he skipped. 	Emil Artin	Maths
Outside observers often assume that the more complicated a piece of mathematics is, the more mathematicians admire it. Nothing could be further from the truth. Mathematicians admire elegance and simplicity above all else, and the ultimate goal in solving a problem is to find the method that does the job in the most efficient manner... 	Keith Devlin	Maths
When a student works on a mathematical problem, he comes to a stage beyond which he does not know how to proceed, and where he is in doubt or perplexity. As long as he has this doubt, he cannot proceed. If he wants to proceed, he must resolve this doubt. And there are ways of resolving that doubt. Just to say &#;I believe&#;, or &#;I do not doubt&#;, will certainly not solve the problem. To force oneself to believe and to accept a thing without understanding is political, and not spiritual or intellectual. 	Walpola Rahula	Maths
Compare mathematics and the political sciences &#; it&#;s quite striking. In mathematics, in physics, people are concerned with what you say, not with your certification. But in order to speak about social reality, you must have the proper credentials, particularly if you depart from the accepted framework of thinking. Generally speaking, it seems fair to say that the richer the intellectual substance of a field, the less there is a concern for credentials, and the greater is the concern for content. 	Noam Chomsky	Maths
I never came across one of Laplace's Thus it plainly appears without feeling sure that I have hours of hard work before me to fill up the chasm and find out and show how it plainly appears. 	Nathaniel Bowditch	Maths
People who know math understand what other mortals understand, but other mortals do not understand them. This asymmetry gives them a presumption of superior ability. 	Daniel Kahneman	Maths
It is no exaggeration to say that the vast business of calculus made possible most of the practical triumphs of postmedieval science, or to say that it stands as one of the most ingenious creations of humans trying to model the world around them. 	James Gleick	Maths
It is remarkable that a science which began with the consideration of games of chance should have become the most important object of human knowledge. 	Pierre-Simon Laplace	Maths
They find the language richer than its bare content; what is translated comes to mean less to them than the logic and style of saying it; and from these overtones grows mathematics as a literature in its own right.<br>Pure mathematics is a form of poetry which has the same relation to the prose of practical mathematics as poetry has to prose in any other language. The delight of exploring the medium for its own sake. 	Jacob Bronowski	Maths
It is insufficient to protect ourselves with laws; we need to protect ourselves with mathematics. 	Bruce Schneier	Maths
I can best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of a journey through a dark unexplored mansion. You enter the first room of the mansion and it's completely dark. You stumble around bumping into the furniture but gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is. Finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch, you turn it on, and suddenly it's all illuminated. You can see exactly where you were. Then you move into the next room and spend another six months in the dark. So each of these breakthroughs, while sometimes they're momentary, sometimes over a period of a day or two, they are the culmination of , and couldn't exist without, the many months of stumbling around in the dark that proceed them. 	Andrew Wiles	Maths
We must remember that, strictly speaking,&quot;formal &quot; does not mean merely &quot;rigorous &quot; but &quot;according to form'. Meaning need be ascribed only to the result of a formal process. It is not needed to guide the process itself. We ascribe meaning to intermediate formal states primarily, nay solely, to reassure ourselves. 	Guy Steele	Maths
Mathematics, however, is, as it were, its own explanation; this, although it may seem hard to accept, is nevertheless true, for the recognition that a fact is so is the cause upon which we base the proof. 	Girolamo Cardano	Maths
The proof [of the existence of an infinity of prime numbers] is by reductio ad absurdum, and reductio ad absurdum, which Euclid loved so much, is one of a mathematician&#;s favourite weapons. It is a far finer gambit than any chess gambit: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game. 	GH Hardy	Maths
Poincaré concluded that the axioms of geometry are conventions, our choice among all possible conventions is guided by experimental facts, but it remains free and is limited only by the necessity of avoiding all contradiction. Thus it is that the postulates can remain rigorously true even though the experimental laws that have determined their adoption are only approximative. The axioms of geometry, in other words, are merely disguised definitions. 	Robert Pirsig	Maths
Maxwell&#;s talk of a large number of systems, instead of a continuous one, was a characteristic way of expression of a physicist<br>who tends to see the infinite as an approximation to the sufficiently large finite. (A mathematician might think exactly the other way around.) 	John von Plato	Maths
What could be more general than 2, which can represent two galaxies or two pickles, or one galaxy plus one pickle (the mind doth boggle), or just 2 gently bobbing &#; where? It, like God, is an &#;I am&#; and many have thought that it must be a precipitate of ultimate reality. 	Alfred W. Crosby	Maths
&#;I count a lot of things that there&#;s no need to count,&#; Cameron said. &#;Just because that&#;s the way I am. But I count all the things that need to be counted.&#; 	Richard Brautigan	Maths
More and more I&#;m aware that the permutations are not unlimited. 	Russell Hoban	Maths
Still more recently has it been found that the good Bishop Berkeley&#;s logical jibes against the Newtonian ideas of fluxions and limiting ratios cannot be adequately appeased in the rigorous mathematical conscience, until our apparent continuities are resolved mentally into discrete aggregates which we only partally apprehend. The irresistible impulse to atomize everything thus proves to be not only a disease of the physicist; a deeper origin, in the nature of knowledge itself, is suggested. 	J. Larmor	Maths
The object of mathematical rigor is to sanction and legitimate the conquests of intuition, and there never was any other object for it. 	Jacques Hadamard	Maths
A set is a Many that allows itself to be thought of as a One. 	Georg Cantor	Maths
Set theory has a dual role in mathematics. In pure mathematics, it is the place where questions about infinity are studied. Although this is a fascinating study of permanent interest, it does not account for the importance of set theory in applied areas. There the importance stems from the fact that set theory provides an incredibly versatile toolbox for building mathematical models of various phenomena. 	Jon Barwise and Lawrence Moss	Maths
Mathematics... is concerned with a wider domain than that domain which it is the object of the natural sciences to describe and categorize. The natural sciences are concerned with the actual world. Mathematics is concerned with &#;all possible worlds&#;. 	David Malet Armstrong	Maths
Nowadays, one of the most interesting points in mathematics is that, although all categorical reasonings are formally contradictory, we use them and we never make a mistake. Grothendieck provided a partial foundation in terms of universes but a revolution of the foundations similar to what Cauchy and Weierstrass did for analysis is still to arrive. In this respect, he was pragmatic: categories are useful and they give results so we do not have to look at subtle set-theoretic questions if there is no need. Is today the moment to think about these problems? Maybe &#; 	Pierre Cartier	Maths
To be is to be the value of a variable. 	WVO Quine	Maths
Groups are important and beautiful objects. 	Princeton Math Club	Maths
Whatever you have to do with a structure-endowed entity Σ try to determine its group of automorphisms &#; You can expect to gain a deep insight into the constitution of Σ in this way. 	Hermann Weyl	Maths
&#;&#; I think in a line &#; but there is the potentiality of the plane.&#; This perhaps was what great art was &#; a momentary apprehension of the plane at a point in the line. 	Charles Williams	Maths
When a pattern shows itself in tiles or in your mind and says, &#;This is the mode of my repetition; in this manner I extend myself to infinity&#;, it has already done so: it has already been infinite; the potentiality and the actuality are one thing. If two and two can be four then they actually are four, you can only perceive it, you have no part in making it happen by writing it down in numbers or telling it out in pebbles. 	Russell Hoban	Maths
As are the crests on the heads of peacocks,<br>as are the gems on hoods of cobras,<br>so is mathematics at the top of all sciences. 	Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa	Maths
In mathematics, deception as to whether real understanding is present or not, is least possible. 	Felix Klein	Maths
Wherefore in all great works are Clerks so much desired?<br>Wherefore are Auditors so well-fed?<br>what causeth Geometricians so highly to be enhaunsed?<br>Why are Astronomers so greatly advanced?<br>Because that by number such things they find,<br>which else would farre excell mans minde. 	Robert Recorde	Maths
By keenly confronting the enigmas that surround us, and by considering and analyzing the observations I had made, I ended up in the domain of mathematics.  	Maurits Escher	Maths
Mathematics never reveals man to the degree, never expresses him in the way, that any other field of human endeavour does: the extent of the negation of man&#;s corporeal self that mathematics achieves cannot be compared with anything... Here I will say only that the world injected its patterns into human language at the very inception of that language; mathematics sleeps in every utterance, and can only be discovered, never invented. 	Stanislaw Lem	Maths
Everybody who reasons carefully about anything is making a contribution &#; and if you abstract it away and send it to the Department of Mathematics they put it in books... 	Richard Feynman	Maths
On sighting mathematicians [poetry] should unhook the algebra from their minds and replace it with poetry; on sighting poets it should unhook poetry from their minds and replace it with algebra. 	Brian Patten	Maths
Of the properties of mathematics, as a language, the most peculiar one is that by playing formal games with an input mathematical text, one can get an output text which seemingly carries new knowledge. The basic examples are furnished by scientific or technological calculations: general laws plus initial conditions produce predictions, often only after time-consuming and computer-aided work. One can say that the input contains an implicit knowledge which is thereby made explicit. One could try to find a parallel in the humanities by comparing this to hermeneutics: the art of finding hidden meanings of sacred texts. Legal discourse, too, has some common traits with scientific discourse. In the course of history, the modern language of science slowly emerged from these two archaic activities, and it still owes a lot to them, especially in the more descriptive and less mathematicised domains. 	Yuri Manin	Maths
&#;The study of mental objects with reproducible properties is called mathematics.&#; I love this definition because it doesn&#;t try to limit mathematics to what has been called mathematics in the past but really attempts to say why certain communications are classified as math, others as science, others as art, others as gossip. Thus reproducible properties of the physical world are science whereas reproducible mental objects are math.Art lives on the mental plane (the real painting is not the set of dry pigments on the canvas nor is a symphony the sequence of sound waves that convey it to our ear) but, as the post-modernists insist, is reinterpreted in new contexts by each appreciator. As for gossip, which includes the vast majority of our thoughts, its essence is its relation to a unique local part of time and space.	David Mumford	Maths
One can say that the input mathematical text contains implicit knowledge, which is made explicit [by formal games]. One could try to find a parallel in the humanities by comparing this to hermeneutics: the art of finding the hidden meaning of sacred texts.

In the course of history, the modern language of science slowly emerged from these two archaic activities, and it still owes a lot to them, especially in the more descriptive and less mathematicised domains. 	Yuri Manin	Maths
The goal of a definition is to introduce a mathematical object. The goal of a theorem is to state some of its properties, or interrelations between various objects. The goal of a proof is to make such a statement convincing by presenting a reasoning subdivided into small steps, each of which is an &quot;elementary &quot; convincing argument. To put it simply, we first explain what we are talking about, and then explain why what we are saying is true. 	Yuri Manin	Maths
the ocean of mathematical understanding just keeps monotonically rising, and we’ve seen it reach peaks like Fermat’s Last Theorem that had once been synonyms for hopelessness.  I see absolutely no reason why the same ocean can’t someday swallow P vs. NP, provided our civilization lasts long enough.  In fact, whether our civilization will last long enough is by far my biggest uncertainty.  	Scott Aaronson	Maths
To exist (in mathematics), said Henri Poincaré, is to be free from contradiction. But mere existence does not guarantee survival. To survive in mathematics requires a kind of vitality that cannot be described in purely logical terms. 	Mark Kac and Stanislaw Ulam	Maths
Perhaps the most conspicuous feature that distinguishes our contemporary modern logic from its predecessors is the assumption that verbs for being are ambiguous between the is of predication (the copula), the is of existence, the is of identity, and the is of subsumption.	Jaako Hintikka	Maths

In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them 	John von Neumann	Maths
For scholars and laymen alike it is not philosophy but active experience in mathematics itself that can alone answer the question: What is mathematics?	Richard Courant	Maths
Imagine I asked you to learn a programming language where:  - All the variable names were a single letter, and where programmers enjoyed using foreign alphabets, glyph variation and fonts to disambiguate their code from meaningless gibberish.  - None of the functions were documented, and instead the API docs consisted of circular references to other pieces of similar code, often with the same names overloaded into multiple meanings, often impossible to Google. - None of the sample code could be run on a typical computer; in fact, most of it was pseudo-code lacking a definition of input and output, or even the environment it was supposed to run.  - Papers describing novel ideas were incomprehensible by default, so that the most established experts would need years to decide whether a particularly cutting-edge program was meaningful or in fact insane gibberish.	Steven Wittens	Maths
It is easy to lie with statistics, but it is easier to lie without them. 	Frederick Mosteller	Statistics

the rules of right reason... ought to be contained in Logic; but the actual science of Logic is conversant at present only with things either certain, impossible, or entirely doubtful, none of which (fortunately) we have [available] to reason on. Therefore the true Logic for this world is the Calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability (which is, or which ought to be, in a reasonable man's mind). 	James Clerk Maxwell	Statistics
We could call Bayesian data analysis “statistics using conditional probability”, but that wouldn’t put the butts in the seats. 	Gelman	Statistics
A golem is a robot constructed from dust and fire and water. It is brought to life by inscribing emet, Hebrew for “truth”, on its brow... Scientists also make golems. Our golems rarely have physical form, but they too are often made of clay, living in silicon as computer code. These golems are scientific models. But these golems have real effects on the world, through the predictions they make and the intuitions they challenge or inspire. A concern with “truth” enlivens these models, but... scientific models are neither true nor false, neither prophets nor charlatans. Rather they are constructs engineered for some purpose. 	Richard McElreath	Statistics
The [central limit theorem] would have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known of it. It reigns with serenity and in complete self-effacement, amidst the wildest confusion. The huger the mob, and the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason. Whenever a large sample of chaotic elements are taken in hand and marshaled in the order of their magnitude, an unsuspected and most beautiful form of regularity proves to have been latent all along. 	Francis Galton	Statistics
The danger is that the present measure-theory notation presupposes the infinite limit already accomplished, but contains no symbol indicating which limiting process was used... When there is no well-behaved limit, any attempt to go directly to it can result in nonsense, the cause of which cannot be seen as long as one looks only at the limit, and not at the limiting process. 	Ed Jaynes	Statistics
Entire classes of scalable distributions converge to the Gaussian too slowly to be of any significance... [e.g.] the presasymptotics of fractal distributions are such that the effect of the Central Limit Theorem is exceedingly slow in the tails - in fact, the effect is irrelevant. 	Taleb	Statistics

Through and through the world is infested with quantity: To talk sense is to talk quantities. It is not use saying the nation is large .. How large? It is no use saying the radium is scarce... How scarce? You cannot evade quantity. You may fly to poetry and music, and quantity and number will face you in your rhythms and your octaves. 	Alfred North Whitehead	Statistics
The theory of probabilities and the theory of errors [are] not only a commendable element in a liberal education, but some knowledge of them is essential to a correct understanding of daily events. 	Robert Woodward	Statistics
Measurement does not necessarily mean progress... the lust for measurement may, for example, merely result in your measuring something else - and perhaps forgetting the difference - or in your ignoring some things because they cannot be measured. 	George Udny Yule	Statistics
Suppose you were exposed to a subject as a sub-cabalistic ritual of manipulating sums of squares and magical tables according to rules justified (if at all) only by a transparently false origin myth — that is to say, you had to endure an intro. stats. class — or, perhaps worse, a &quot;research methods &quot; class whose content had fossilized before you were born.	Cosma Shalizi	Statistics
Machine learning is statistics minus any checking of models and assumptions.	Brian Ripley	Statistics
If you give people a linear model function you give them something dangerous.	John Fox	Statistics
In statistics, context always matters; this is in direct contrast to mathematics, which is the study of objects independent of context. Mathematics is about moving from the general to the specific (deduction), while statistics is about moving from the specific to the general (induction), and that is impossible to do without understanding the natures of both.	Jeffrey Simonof	Statistics
Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.	William Bruce Cameron	Statistics
Their effect size is tiny and their measurement error is huge. My best analogy is that they are trying to use a bathroom scale to weigh a feather—and the feather is resting loosely in the pouch of a kangaroo that is vigorously jumping up and down.  At some point, a set of measurements is so noisy that biases in selection and interpretation overwhelm any signal and, indeed, nothing useful can be learned from them.	Andrew Gelman	Statistics

This idea of entangling unrelated systems so that the heap of silicon you hold can tell you what the weather will be tomorrow or what just happened on the other side of the world is impossibly and wonderfully strange and yet hardly even noticed. The process of entangling one of these miraculous devices is called programming.	Jamie Brandon	Code

The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, by exertion of the imagination...<br>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.	Fred Brooks	Code
Mind seems able to impress some of its highest attributes upon matter, and to create its own rival in the wheels and levers of an insensible machine.	William Jevons 	Code
The Heart of Africa has lost its mystery; the planets of Tau Ceti are currently unknown and unreachable. Nevertheless, the rise of digital computers has given this generation its galleons and astrolabes. The undiscovered lands exist, in one sense, only as intermittent electric rivers in dendritic networks of copper and silicon, invisible as the soul. And yet the mystery of scientiﬁc computing is that its new worlds over the water, wrought only of numbers, are as real as the furrowed brow of the ﬁrst Cro-Magnon who was mystiﬁed by the stars, and looked for a story.

Computer literacy is a contact... deep enough to make the computational equivalent of reading and writing fluent and enjoyable. As in all the arts, a romance with the material must be well under way.

The computers are never large enough or fast enough. Each breakthrough in hardware technology leads to more massive programming enterprises, new organizational principles, and an enrichment of abstract models.

A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions  based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place.	IEEE Grid newsmagazine	Code
Most of mathematics is stateless... your job is to find the numbers you can use in place of x that satisfy that constraint... You may use an algorithm for solving the constraint, but nothing about the constraint is changing as you are solving it, even if you're changing its visible form...  <br>Much of programming, on the other hand, is about state, and expressing a precise order of changing states is what most programmers do for a living.	Steven Abell	Code
Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for [six] or more months might as well have been written by someone else.	Eagleson's Law	Code
The programmers were horrified too: they derived their intellectual excitement from not quite understanding what they were doing and their professional satisfaction from finding weird bugs they had first introduced in their daring irresponsibility.	Edsger Dijkstra	Code
HOW DOES PROGRAMMING TAKE SO LONG? YOU LITERALLY JUST TYPE WHAT YOU WANT IT TO DO THIS SHOULD BE EASY	Jessie Newman impersonating	Code
when our world finally comes to understand the power and danger of code — when it finally sees that code, like laws, or like government, must be transparent to be free — we will... recognize the vision [Stallman] has fought to make real: the vision of a world where freedom and knowledge survives the compiler... we will come to see that no man, through his deeds or words, has done as much to make possible the freedom that this next society could have. We have not earned that freedom yet. We may well fail in securing it. But whether we succeed or fail, in these essays is a picture of what that freedom could be.	Lawrence Lessig	Code

How can you tell if a hack is okay? Because it&#;s one line long. Because it&#;s simpler. Because it works perfectly. Because you know the right way, but there is a good reason for choosing the wrong way. Because you leave a warning for other developers - Dragons Be Here. <br>Conversely, how can you tell if a hack is bad? Because it is several times longer than The Right Way. Because complicated. Because breakable. Because reading the code makes you wonder if they know the right way. Because no reason to prefer a hack. Because no comment on the intent.	John Morrice	Code
We like to think we spend most of our time power-typing. &quot;I'm being productive, I'm writing programs!&quot; But, we don't. We spend most of our time looking intothe abyss, saying, &quot;My God, what have I done?&quot;<br>I used to think everyone should learn programming. When I first starting programming... I thought, &quot;Wow, this is such an amazing way to organize information! Everybody should learn to do this!&quot; I don't think that any more. Ithink there has to be something seriously wrong with you, in order to do this work. A normal person, once they've looked into the abyss, will say, &quot;I'm done.This is stupid. I'm going to go to something else.&quot; But not us,&quot;cause there's something really wrong with us.	Douglas Crockford	Code
Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.	Edsger Dijkstra	Code
...I think my favorite part of writing code is the vertiginous terror of manifesting machinery out of pure ideas, summoning thought-engines from the underworld with unknown lives and dollars hanging in the balance and protected only by the clarity of one's understanding, and the clarity of understanding of the ones who wrote the tools built on tools built on tools extending thirty layers deep into the underworld on which the fictive ontology of our existence carefully rests, praying that the test suite is comprehensive, knowing that it isn't, hoping that the fullness of your thought in its obvious righteousness doesn't need it and that the customers and investors and hypothetical ascended children's children's children would smile on this moment, judging that you have brought honor to this endeavor, the last human profession.

Heuristics are bug ridden by definition. If they didn't have bugs, then they'd be algorithms. 		Code
People always define computers as &quot;data-processing machines &quot; - which they are not and cannot be, because data are mental events. Machines process representations - and all this is is us using the physical world to help us with the mental world we have such limited range within (usually to help us with the physical world we have such limited control over). (This is also why the infinite cannot be properly represented, because there is nothing usably physical for the purpose.) In the reified field that gets called &quot;Computing &quot; we happen to use voltages to represent mental events, but I seriously encourage you to consider computing less narrowly; you will never be right, otherwise.<br>Human language being what it is, the category error of &quot;data &quot; as data representation has by now been thoroughly inscribed. The truth lost. So you'll hear me say that &quot;the system is processing data'. But I don't mean it.	Lewis Mackenzie	Code
We write programs (target application) with a program (editor) whose output feeds a program (compiler) that produces the usable program (executable) - and all of these are running on a program that is a metaphor for a  machine (OS).	Lewis Mackenzie	Code
Transmission is strictly limited by each component, of course. If you send a message faster than either the transmitter can pulse, than the channel can discretely convey, or the receiver-decoder can parse, it will be lost, or useless, or worse. (Faulty data is worse than no data because it deceives us.)	Lewis Mackenzie	Code
If you have a procedure with 10 parameters, you probably missed some. 	Perlis	Code
If you put garbage in a computer nothing comes out but garbage. But this garbage, having passed through a very expensive machine, is somehow ennobled and none dare criticize it. 	Perlis	Code
In enabling mechanism to combine together general symbols, in successions of unlimited variety and extent, a uniting link is established between the operations of matter and the abstract mental processes of the most abstract branch of mathematical science. A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have rendered possible.

The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly.

We steep ourselves in elusive, mysterious, and unnamed phenomena, and struggle to unravel complex puzzles, often making no visible progress for weeks or months, sometimes for years. We strive for simplicity and clarity in a cloudy and often baffling world. The special risk of research starts with the high probability that any particular attempt will fail, and follows from the resulting experience of repeated failure.	Ivan Sutherland	Research
When I'm working on a research problem I generally begin by filling dozens of sheets of scratch paper with partial calculations. When I eventually get to a point where I can think about the problem while swimming, then I'm often ready to solve it.	Don Knuth	Research
Think of a &quot;discovery &quot; as an act that moves the arrival of information from a later point in time to an earlier time. The value does not equal the value of the information discovered but rather the value of having the information available earlier than it otherwise would have been. A scientist or a mathematician may show great skill by being the first to find a solution that has eluded many others; yet if the problem would soon have been solved anyway, then the work probably has not much benefited the world. There are cases in which having a solution even slightly sooner is immensely valuable, but this is most plausible when the solution is immediately put to use, either being deployed for some practical end or serving as a foundation to further theoretical work.	Nick Bostrom	Research
The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.	Amos Tversky	Research

The most ordinary things are to philosophy a source of insoluble puzzles. With infinite ingenuity it constructs a concept of space or time and then finds it absolutely impossible that there be objects in this space or that processes occur during this time... the source of this kind of logic lies in excessive confidence in the so-called laws of thought.

Happy is the man who can recognise in the work of to-day a connected portion of the work of life and an embodiment of the work of Eternity. The foundations of his confidence are unchangeable, for he has been made a partaker of Infinity. He strenuously works out his daily enterprises because the present is given him for a possession. Thus ought Man to be an impersonation of the divine process of nature, and to show forth the union of the infinite with the finite, not slighting his temporal existence, remembering that in it only is individual action possible; nor yet shutting out from his view that which is eternal, knowing that Time is a mystery which man cannot endure to contemplate until eternal Truth enlighten it.

People talk about “liberalism” as if it’s just another word for capitalism, or libertarianism, or vague center-left Clintonism. Liberalism is none of these things. Liberalism is a technology for preventing civil war. It was forged in the fires of Hell – the endless seventeenth century religious wars. For a hundred years, Europe tore itself apart in the most brutal ways – until finally, from the burning wreckage, we drew forth this amazing piece of alien machinery. A machine that, when tuned just right, let people live together peacefully without doing the “kill people for being Protestant” thing.Popular historical strategies for dealing with differences have included: brutally enforced conformity, brutally efficient genocide, and making sure to keep the alien machine tuned really really carefully.

Even hatred of squalor makes the brow stern. Even anger at injustice makes the voice harsh. <br>Alas we, wanting to lay the foundations of kindness <br>Could not ourselves be kind. 	Brecht	Politics
The word &quot;revolution &quot; is a word for which you kill, for which you die, for which you send the labouring masses to their death, but which does not possess any content. 	Simone Weil	Politics
nothing was ever yet done which someone was not the first to do... all good things which exist are the fruits of originality, let them be modest enough to believe that there is something still left for it to accomplish.	Mill	Politics
Anonymous asked: you have the most hilariously naive politics i've ever seen, it's milquetoast pacifist liberalism meets autistic rationalism. grow a fucking backbone you fuck.'<br>Unitofcaring: certain subbubbles of the Left have constructed this environment in which it is inherently pathetic, inherently contemptible, to say “mass murder is a really awful thing and if we can achieve our goals without it that’s worth striving for” or even “no matter what, I won’t endorse or participate in mass murder”. I can imagine how I’d be a Marxist. 30,000 kids die preventable deaths every day and that makes me angrier and sadder than you can possibly imagine and if I’d gotten ensnared in an ideology that claimed the only way for that to end was to kill all of the rich people, I’d probably also go around saying “kill all the rich people!” But I hope I’d never, ever equate “willingness to call for murder” with “moral strength” or “strength of character”.Valuing life is moral strength. Protecting people is strength of character. Calling for mass murder from your keyboard is cowardice. And the communities that deny those things, that circle the wagons around their conviction that willingness to kill people is equivalent to having a backbone, that claiming “the rich all deserve to die” is moral strength, that caring about human life is hilariously naive -- well, first of all, you’ll never get anything done. My friends and I will end those  deaths, eradicate malaria, fix global inequality, hunt down every source of human suffering and watch it take its last breath while you’ll sit there going “milquetoast pacifists! hilariously naive! the rich are not innocent!”. But second of all, you’ll spend your not-accomplishing-anything time in a bubble where caring about all human life is a weakness, where not wanting to murder people is disgusting and contemptible, and I know people are different psychologically but I can’t imagine anything worse than that....come join us, we milquetoast autistic rationalist liberals, because you don’t have to rant on the internet about killing people to earn our esteem, you just have to fix stuff.

Praise the humanities, my boy. That'll make them think you're broadminded! 	Churchill	Art
mankind has various ways, some of them too technical to register as art, of adding to the store of beautiful created things... 	Clive James	Art
A machine is as distinctively and brilliantly and expressively human as a violin sonata or a theorem in Euclid.	Gregory Vlastos	Art
It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. 	Thoreau	Art
Art is the imposing of a pattern on experience, and our aesthetic enjoyment is recognition of the pattern. 	AN Whitehead	Art
The artist talks to himself out loud. 	Edmund Snow Carpenter	Art
Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is the ash. 	Leonard Cohen	Art
Once you're no longer in the day job, you don't know what's going on with people... Even if you're not a hermit, you're talking to people as an observer, and an observer can never know what a participant can know... I seemed to have less to say... If a writer disengages from people at large, his ability to describe the behaviour of people is going to suffer. 	John Darnielle	Art
To those who do not know mathematics, it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature... If you want... to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in. 	Richard Feynman	Art
I begin to doubt beautiful words. How one longs sometimes to have done something in the world. 	Virginia Woolf	Art
Colleagues of mine will tell you that people despise critics because they fear our power. But I know better. People despise critics because people despise weakness, and criticism is the weakest thing you can do in writing. It is the written equivalent of air guitar — flurries of silent, sympathetic gestures with nothing at their heart but the memory of the music. It produces no knowledge, states no facts, and never stands alone. It neither saves the things we love (as we would wish them saved) nor ruins the things we hate.	Dave Hickey	Art
I see the object. I translate that into vision. I encode that into language, and append whatever speculations and special pleadings I deem appropriate. At this point, what I have written departs. It enters the historical past, perpetually absent from the present, and only represented there in type, while the visible artifact remains in the present moment — regardless of its antiquity, perpetually re-created...  The writing gets older with each passing moment while the artifact gets newer. They remain as fresh and devious as the first day I set my eyes upon them — while the words I wrote on that occasion, informed by that brightness, have yellowed into antiquity and seem to me now as weathered and grotesque as Dorian’s portrait tucked away in the attic. Thus, in the same sense that there is only historical writing, there is no historical art... the artifact itself, as we stand before it, is always newer and more extensive than any word ever written about it — newer and more extensive, even, than the visual codes incorporated into it, because whether we like it or not, we always confront works of art as part of that selfless, otherless, unwritable instant of ordinary experience.	Dave Hickey	Art
He rejected the bird’s nest of traditions, stories, and knowledge that cushioned most people, the cultural resting place woven from bits of religion, American history, English literature, Greek myth, Dutch painting, German music. He was starting fresh.	of Feynman	Art
...far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent? 	Richard Feynman	Art
Physics becomes in those years [ - ] the greatest collective work of... art of the twentieth century. 	Jacob Bronowski	Art
We don't always have to be this. There can be something else. We can stop doing the thing that we're doing. Moms Mabley had a great line in some movie or other -- she said,&quot;You keep on doing what you been doing and you're gonna keep on gettin &quot; what you been gettin.&quot; And we don't have to keep on doing what we've been doing. We can do something else if we don't like what we're gettin'. I think a lot of the purpose of fiction ought to be to tell people that.	Gene Wolfe	Art
In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry, it's the exact opposite. 	Paul Dirac	Art
When architects get prizes, the people suffer. 	John McCarthy	Art
An artist can be diminished by his virtues, [for instance] clarity. However much the reader welcomes clarity, some of the most memorable moments in poetry occur when it isn't exactly clear what the poet is talking about... Betjeman never [has such moments] because he always is sure, and that's the penalty of being lucid. 	Alan Bennett	Art
The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, leaving us mainly with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists. Modern art is a disaster area. Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little.	Banksy	Art
mythology is psychology misread as biography 	Joseph Campbell	Art
[Academic] literary criticism, I think, is not empiricism: it&#;s not trying to make predictions about what features stories will have or what characteristics will make readers like stories or whatever. It&#;s art. It&#;s a very unusual kind of art that takes other art as its raw material. It&#;s the task of the reader taken to its highest form. This kind is about making interpretations that are more interesting than most people&#;s, that make it more interesting than it previously was. Asking whether or not it&#;s &#;true&#; is like asking whether or not a painting is &#;true&#;. 	Ozy Frantz	Art
If opinion is always [purely] contingent, why should we subsidize professionals to produce it? 	Louis Menand	Art
A copy of the universe is not what is required of art; one of the damned things is ample. 	Rebecca West	Art
Music fueled me, although I was just dimly realizing that I was at core a verbal child. In the shower I wailed and whammed at imaginary keyboards, drums, later guitars, but most especially saxes, emulating my heroes with twenty-minute atonal ragas that soared to their stormiest climaxes when the hot water ended. 	Lester Bangs	Art
Wit is the sudden marriage of ideas which before their union were not perceived to have any relation. 	Mark Twain	Art
My guess is that well over eighty per cent of the human race goes through life without ever having a single original thought. That is to say, they never think anything that has not been thought before, and by thousands. A society made up of individuals who were all capable of original thought would probably be unendurable. The pressure of ideas would simply drive it frantic.	HL Mencken	Art

...the writer's life is a lonely life; you think it's just you; but as the years go by, if your stars are propitious, you discover you are at the center of a vast circle of invisible friends - friends you will never know but who love you and this is more than enough reward. <br>	Jorge Luis Borges	Art
It isn't that the aesthete is too serious about the artistic: he isn't serious enough about what gives rise to it.	Clive James	Art

Without education, we are in a horrible and deadly danger of taking educated people seriously. 	G.K. Chesterton	Education
A fool's brain digests philosophy into folly, science into superstition, and art into pedantry. Hence University education. 	George Bernard Shaw	Education
...from the time it learns to talk, every child makes a dreadful nuisance of itself by asking &quot;Why?'. To stop this nuisance, society has invented a marvellous system called &quot;education &quot; which brings to an end their desire to ask that question. The few failures of this system are known as scientists.	Hermann Bondi	Education
Book learning certainly increases knowledge, but it does not broaden one's insight if not accompanied by reason. 	Immanuel Kant	Education
When working on a PhD, you must focus on a topic so narrow that you can understand it completely. It will seem at first that you're working on the proverbial needle, a tiny fragment of the world, a minute crystal, beautiful but in the scheme of things, microscopic. Work with it. And the more you work with it, the more you penetrate it, the more you will come to see that your work, your subject, encompasses the world. In time, you will come to see the world in your grain of sand.	Manuel Blum	Education
Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it, but those who learn too much from history are doomed to make the exact opposite mistake and accuse anyone who urges restraint of &quot;failing to learn from history &quot; and &quot;dogmatism &quot;.	Scott Alexander	Education

...a curiosity of my type remains the most enjoyable of sins - Pardon! I ought to say:&quot;the love of truth has its reward in heaven and even on earth'. 		Nietzsche
The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold those who think alike in higher esteem than those who think differently. 		Nietzsche
Error has made man so deep, delicate, and inventive as to bring forth such blossoms as religion and art. Pure knowledge would never have been capable of it. 		Nietzsche
We must think of men who are cruel today as stages of earlier cultures, which have been left over ... They show us what we all were, and frighten us. But they themselves are as little responsible as a piece of granite for being granite. 		Nietzsche
An artist cannot endure reality; he turns away, back: his earnest opinion is that the worth of a thing consists in that nebulous residue of it which one derives from color, form, sound, and thought; he believes that the more subtle, at tenuated, and volatile, a thing or a man becomes, the more valuable he becomes: the less real, the greater the worth. This is Platonism... 		Nietzsche
Most men are much too concerned with themselves to be malicious. 		Nietzsche
'I did that &quot; says my memory.&quot;I cannot have done that &quot; says my pride, and remains adamant. At last &#; memory yields. 		Nietzsche
What we do in dreams we also do when we are awake: we invent and fabricate the person with whom we associate &#; and immediately forget we have done so. 		Nietzsche
Our vanity would have just that which we do best count as that which is hardest for us. The origin of many a morality. 		Nietzsche
With regard to what &quot;truthfulness &quot; is, perhaps nobody has ever been sufficiently truthful. 		Nietzsche
This immense framework of concepts which the needy man clings to his whole life, to preserve himself, is only a scaffold and toy to the most liberated intellect. And when he smashes this framework to pieces, throws it into confusion, and puts it back together in an ironic fashion, pairing the most alien things and separating the closest, he is demonstrating that he has no need of these indigent makeshifts, that he is guided not by concepts but by intuitions. There is no regular path which leads from these intutions into the land of ghostly schemata, the land of abstractions. There exists no word for these intuitions; when man sees them he grows dumb, or else he speaks only in forbidden metaphors and in unheard-of combinations of concepts. He does this so that, by shattering and mocking the old conceptual barriers, he may at least correspond creatively to the impression of present-day intuitions. 		Nietzsche
Has it come to this: do you just want an idea of God, world and reconciliation, what makes you most comfortable? Isn't the true researcher indifferent to the result of his research? Do we look for silence, peace and happiness from our research? No: only truth, and that will be a most daunting and hateful thing. 		Nietzsche
The philosopher believes that the value of his philosophy lies in the whole, in the building: posterity discovers it in the bricks with which he built and which are then often used again for better building. 		Nietzsche
What really fills one with indignation about suffering is not the suffering itself, but the pointlessness of suffering. 		Nietzsche
We often contradict an opinion for no other reason than that we do not like the tone in which it is expressed. 		Nietzsche
The mother of excess is not joy but joylessness. 		Nietzsche
Enemies of truth. Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies. 		Nietzsche
The first opinion that occurs to us when we are suddenly asked about a matter is usually not our own, but only the customary one, appropriate to our caste, position, or parentage; our own opinions seldom swim near the surface. 		Nietzsche
Generally we strive to acquire one emotional stance, one viewpoint for all life situations and events: we usually call that being of a philosophical frame of mind. But rather than making oneself uniform, we may find greater value for the enrichment of knowledge by listening to the soft voice of different life situations; each brings its own views with it. Thus we acknowledge and share the life and nature of many by not treating ourselves like rigid, invariable, single individuals. 		Nietzsche
Insects sting, not from malice, but because they want to live. It is the same with critics - they desire our blood, not our pain. 		Nietzsche
My soul is a hidden orchestra; I know not what instruments, what fiddlestrings and harps, drums and tamboura I sound and clash inside myself. All I hear is the symphony. 		Pessoa
Since we can't extract beauty from life, let's at least try to extract beauty from not being able to extract beauty from life. 		Pessoa
I often wonder what kind of person I would be if I had been protected from the cold wind of fate by the screen of wealth... to reach the tawdry heights of being a good assistant book-keeper in a job that is about as demanding as an afternoon nap and offers a salary that gives me just enough to live on.<br>I know that, had that non-existent past existed, I would not now be capable of writing these pages, which, though few, I would have undoubtedly have only day-dreamed about given more comfortable circumstances. For banality is a form of intelligence, and reality, especially if it is brutish and rough, forms a natural complement to the soul. Much of what I feel and think I owe to my work as a book-keeper since the former exists as a negation of and flight from the latter. 		Pessoa
Caesar gave the ultimate definition of ambition when he said: &#;Better to be the chief of a village than a subaltern in Rome!&quot; 		Pessoa
In these random impressions, with no desire to be other than random, I indifferently narrate my factless autobiography, my lifeless history. These are my confessions, and if in them I say nothing, it's because I have nothing to say. 		Pessoa
And at this table in my absurd room, I, a pathetic and anonymous office clerk, write words as if they were the soul's salvation, and I gild myself with the impossible sunset of high and vast hills in the distance, with the statue I received in exchange for life's pleasures, and with the ring of renunciation on my evangelical finger, the stagnant jewel of my ecstatic disdain. 		Pessoa
Happy the creators of pessimistic systems! Besides taking refuge in the fact of having made something, they can exult in their explanation of universal suffering, and include themselves in it.<br>I don't complain about the world. I don't protest in the name of the universe. I'm not a pessimist. I suffer and complain, but I don't know if suffering is the norm, nor do I know if it's human to suffer. Why should I care to know? I'm not a pessimist. I'm sad. 		Pessoa
Civilisation consists in giving something a name that doesn't belong to it and then dreaming over the result. And the false name joined to the true dream does create a new reality. The object does change into something else, because we make it change. We manufacture realities. 		Pessoa
I belong to a generation that inherited disbelief in the Christian faith and created in itself a disbelief in all other faiths. Our fathers still had the believing impulse, which they transferred from Christianity to other forms of illusion. Some were champions of social equality, others were wholly enamoured of beauty, still others had faith in science and its achievements, and there were some who became even more Christian, resorting to various Easts and Wests in search of new religious forms to entertain their otherwise hollow consciousness of merely living. 		Pessoa
Every gesture, however simple, violates an inner secret. Every gesture is a revolutionary act; an exile, perhaps, from the true ... of our intentions. Action is a disease of thought, a cancer of imagination. Action is self-exile. Every action is incomplete and flawed. 		Pessoa
To attain the satisfaction of the mystic state without having to endure its rigours; to be the ecstatic followers of no god, the mystic or epopt with no initiation; to pass the days meditating on a paradise you don't believe in - all of this tastes good to the soul that knows it knows nothing. 		Pessoa
Life is an experimental journey undertaken involuntarily. It is a journey of the spirit through the material world and, since it is the spirit that travels, it is the spirit that is experienced. That is why there exist contemplative souls who have lived more intensely, more widely, more tumultuously than others who have lived their lives purely externally. 		Pessoa
I asked for very little from life, and even this little was denied me. A nearby field, a ray of sunlight, a little bit of calm along with a bit of bread, not to feel oppressed by the knowledge that I exist, not to demand anything from others, and not to have others demand anything from me - this was denied me, like the spare change we might deny a beggar not because we're mean-hearted but because we don't feel like unbuttoning our coat. 		Pessoa
There are ships sailing to many ports, but not a single one goes to where life is not painful; nor is there a port of call where it is possible to forget. 		Pessoa
I read and am liberated. I acquire objectivity. I cease being myself and so scattered. And what I read, instead of being like a nearly invisible suit that sometimes oppresses me, is the external world&#;s tremendous and remarkable clarity, the sun that sees everyone, the moon that splotches the still earth with shadows, the wide expanses that end in the sea, the blackly solid trees whose tops greenly wave, the steady peace of ponds on farms, the terraced slopes with their paths overgrown by grape-vines. 		Pessoa
Each of us is several, is many,is a profusion of selves. So that the self who disdains his surroundings is not the same as the self who suffers or takes joy in them. In the vast colony of our being there are many species of people who think and feel in different ways. 		Pessoa
I never had anyone I could call &#;Master&#;. No Christ died for me. No Buddha showed me the right path. In the depths of my dreams no Apollo or Athena appeared to me to enlighten my soul. 		Pessoa
I imagined myself forever freed from Rua dos Douradores, Vasques, Guarda, Moreira, all the employees, the boy and the cat... but I would be sorry... I could not leave all this without crying, not understanding that, as bad as it seemed to me, it was part of me that was with them all, that to separate myself from them was halfway and a resemblance to death.<br>		Pessoa
In fact, if I were to leave them all tomorrow and take off from this address in the Rua dos Douradores, what would it give me? What would I wear? - why would I wear it?<br>We all have a Boss Vasques - for some he is visible, for others invisible. For me, he is really called Vasques, and he is a healthy man, pleasant, occasionally brutish, selfish but at the very bottom, with a justice that many great geniuses lack and the many human wonders of civilization, right and left. For others it will be vanity, the yearning for greater wealth, glory, immortality ... I prefer Vasques, my master, more tractable at times than all the abstract bosses in the world.<br>		Pessoa
I love all of this, perhaps because I have nothing else to love... even though nothing truly merits the love of any soul, if, out of sentiment, we must give it, I might as well lavish it on the smallness of an inkwell as on the grand indifference of the stars. 		Pessoa
Let's buy books so as not to read them; let's go to concerts without caring to hear the music or see who's there; let's take long walks because we're sick of walking; and let's spend whole days in the country, just because it bores us. 		Pessoa
When one of my Japanese teacups is broken, I imagine that the real cause was not the careless hand of a maid but the anxieties of the figures inhabiting the curves of that porcelain. Their grim decision to commit suicide doesn't shock me: they used the maid as one of us might use a gun. 		Pessoa
I go forward slowly, dead, and my vision is no longer mine, it&#;s nothing: it&#;s only the vision of the human animal who, without wanting, inherited Greek culture, Roman order, Christian morality, and all the other illusions that constitute the civilization in which I feel. Where can the living be? 		Pessoa
Freedom is the possibility of isolation. You are free if you can withdraw from people, not having to seek them out for the sake of money, company, love, glory or curiosity, none of which can thrive in silence and solitude. If you can't live alone, you were born a slave. You may have all the splendours of the mind and the soul, in which case you're a noble slave, or an intelligent servant, but you're not free. And you can't hold this up as your own tragedy, for your birth is a tragedy of Fate alone. Hapless you are, however, if life itself so oppresses you that you're forced to become a slave. Hapless you are if, having been born free, with the capacity to be isolated and self-sufficient, poverty should force you to live with others. 		Pessoa
I rise from the chair where, absentminded at table, I tell myself these irregular impressions. I rise, I raise my body in myself, and go to the window high above the rooftops, where I can see the city fall asleep, a slow prelude to silence. The moon, large and white, white, sadly illuminates the differing differences of the houses. The moon seems too to illuminate the entire mystery of the world. It seems to show everything - everything is shadow with mixtures of evil light, false intervals, uneven absurdity, inconsistent visibility. There is no breeze, and it seems that the mystery is greater. I'm made nauseous by abstract thinking. I will never write a page that reveals or reveals anything to me. A very light cloud hangs vague above the moon, like a hideout. I am ignorant, like these roofs. I have failed, like all of nature. 		Pessoa
One of my constant preoccupations is trying to understand how it is that other people exist, how it is that there are souls other than mine and consciousnesses not my own, which, because it is a consciousness, seems to me unique. I understand perfectly that the man before me uttering words similar to mine and making the same gestures I make, or could make, is in some way my fellow creature. However, I feel just the same about the people in illustrations I dream up, about the characters I see in novels or the dramatis personae on the stage who speak through the actors representing them.<br>  		Pessoa
I suppose no one truly admits the existence of another person. One might concede that the other person is alive and feels and thinks like oneself, but there will always be an element of difference, a perceptible discrepancy, that one cannot quite put one's finger on. There are figures from times past, fantasy-images in books that seem more real to us than these specimens of indifference-made-flesh who speak to us across the counters of bars, or catch our eye in trams, or brush past us in the empty randomness of the streets. The others are just part of the landscape for us, usually the invisible landscape of the familiar.<br>  		Pessoa
I feel closer ties and more intimate bonds with certain characters in books, with certain images I've seen in engravings, that with many supposedly real people, with that metaphysical absurdity known as &quot;flesh and blood'. In fact &quot;flesh and blood &quot; describes them very well: they resemble cuts of meat laid on the butcher's marble slab, dead creatures bleeding as though still alive, the sirloin steaks and cutlets of Fate.<br> 		Pessoa
I'm not ashamed to feel this way because I know it's how everyone feels. The lack of respect between men, the indifference that allows them to kill others without compunction (as murderers do) or without thinking (as soldiers do), comes from the fact that no one pays due attention to the apparently abstruse idea that other people have souls too. 		Pessoa
I have a very simple morality: not to do good or evil to anyone. Not to do evil, because it seems only fair that others enjoy the same right I demand for myself &#; not to be disturbed &#; and also because I think that the world doesn&#;t need more than the natural evils it already has. All of us in this world are living on board a ship that is sailing from one unknown port to another, and we should treat each other with a traveller&#;s cordiality.<br> 		Pessoa
Not to do good, because I don&#;t know what good is, nor even if I do it when I think I do. How do I know what evils I generate if I give a beggar money? How do I know what evils I produce if I teach or instruct? Not knowing, I refrain. And besides, I think that to help or clarify is, in a certain way, to commit the evil of interfering in the lives of others. Kindness depends on a whim of our mood, and we have no right to make others the victims of our whims, however humane or kind-hearted they may be. Good deeds are impositions; that&#;s why I categorically abhor them. 		Pessoa
Perhaps it's my destiny to remain a book-keeper for ever and for poetry and literature to remain simply butterflies that alight on my head and merely underline my own ridiculousness by their very beauty. 		Pessoa
I feel as if I'm always on the verge of waking up. 		Pessoa
Words are deeds. 		Wittgenstein
What makes a subject difficult to understand... is not that some special knowledge of abstruse things is necessary to understand it. Rather, it is the contrast between understanding of the subject and what most people want to see. Because of this, the very things that are most obvious can become the most difficult to understand. What has to be overcome is not difficulty of the intellect but of the will...<br>A man will be imprisoned in a room with a door that’s unlocked and opens inwards; as long as it does not occur to him to pull rather than push it. 		Wittgenstein
If someone does not believe in fairies, he does not need to teach his children &quot;There are no fairies'; he can omit to teach them the word &quot;fairy'. 		Wittgenstein
My difficulty is only an — enormous — difficulty of expression. 		Wittgenstein
Logic takes care of itself; all we have to do is to look and see how it does it. 		Wittgenstein
I wanted to write that my work consists of two parts: of the one which is here, and of everything which I have not written. And precisely this second part is the important one. 		Wittgenstein
Our only task is to be just. That is, we must only point out and resolve the injustices of philosophy, and not posit new parties – and creeds... All that philosophy can do is destroy idols. And that means not making any new ones – say, out of the &quot;absence of idols'. 		Wittgenstein
What is sayable at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent...<br>		Wittgenstein
The aim of the book is to set a limit to thought, or rather... to the expression of thoughts: for in order to be able to set a limit to thought, we should have to find both sides of the limit thinkable (i.e. we should have to be able to think what cannot be thought). It will thus only be in language that the limit can be set, and what lies on the other side of the limit will simply be nonsense. 		Wittgenstein
Don’t think, but look! 		Wittgenstein
Mathematical propositions express no thoughts. In life it is never a mathematical proposition which we need, but we use mathematical propositions only in order to infer from propositions which do not belong to mathematics to others which, equally, do not belong to mathematics. 		Wittgenstein
We could present spatially an atomic fact which contradicted the laws of physics, but not one which contradicted the laws of geometry. 		Wittgenstein
[What is your aim in philosophy?] To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle. 		Wittgenstein
What kind of investigation are we carrying out? Am I investigating the probability of cases that I give as examples, or am I investigating their actuality? No, I’m just citing what is possible and am therefore giving grammatical examples.  		Wittgenstein
Is scientific progress useful for philosophy? Certainly. The realities that are discovered lighten the philosopher’s task: imagining possibilities. 		Wittgenstein
What happens is not that this symbol cannot be further interpreted, but: I do no interpreting. I do not interpret, because I feel at home in the present picture. When I interpret, I step from one level of thought to another. 		Wittgenstein
I think now that the right thing to do would be to begin my book with remarks about metaphysics as a kind of magic. But in doing this I must neither speak in defence of magic nor ridicule it. In this context, in fact, excluding magic has the character of magic. 		Wittgenstein
The aim of [my] philosophy is to erect a wall at the point where language stops anyway. 		Wittgenstein
The symbolism of Christianity is wonderful beyond words, but when people try to make a philosophical system out of it I find it disgusting. 		Wittgenstein
There are indeed unspeakable things. This shows itself, that's the mystical thing. 		Wittgenstein
The idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to find the common element in all its applications has shackled philosophical investigation; for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss as irrelevant the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him understand the usage of the general term.<br>For remember that in general we don't use language according to strict rules — it hasn't been taught us by means of strict rules, either...<br>What should we gain by a definition, as it can only lead us to other undefined terms? 		Wittgenstein
The fact that I use the word &quot;hand &quot; and all the other words in my sentence without a second thought, indeed that I should stand before the abyss if I wanted so much as to try doubting their meanings — shows that absence of doubt belongs to the essence of the language-game, that the question &quot;How do I know...&quot; drags out the language-game, or else does away with it. 		Wittgenstein
I believe it might interest a philosopher, one who can think himself, to read my notes. For even if I have hit the mark only rarely, he would recognize what targets I had been ceaselessly aiming at. 		Wittgenstein
I am sitting with a philosopher in the garden; he says again and again &quot;I know that that's a tree &quot; pointing to a tree that is near us. Someone else arrives and hears this, and I tell them:&quot;This fellow isn't insane. We are only doing philosophy.&quot; 		Wittgenstein
So in the end when one is doing philosophy one gets to the point where one would like just to emit an inarticulate sound. 		Wittgenstein
Throw away my book: you must understand that it represents only one of a thousand attitudes. You must find your own. Do not do what someone else could do as well as you. Do not say, do not write what someone else could say, could write as well as you. Care for nothing in yourself but what you feel exists nowhere else. And, out of yourself create, impatiently or patiently, the most irreplaceable of beings. 		Gide
Please do not understand me too quickly. 		Gide
Know that joy is rarer, more difficult, and more beautiful than sadness. Once you make this all-important discovery, you must embrace joy as a moral obligation. 		Gide
We prefer to go deformed and distorted all our lives rather than not resemble the portrait of ourselves which we ourselves have first drawn. It&#;s absurd. We run the risk of warping what&#;s best in us. 		Gide
There are very few monsters who warrant the fear we have of them. 		Gide
I prefer granting with a good grace what I know I shan't be able to prevent. 		Gide
Most people believe it is only by constraint they can get any good out of themselves, and so they live in a state of psychological distortion. It is his own self that each of them is most afraid of resembling. Each of them sets up a pattern and imitates it; he doesn't even choose the pattern he imitates: he accepts a pattern that has been chosen for him. And yet I verily believe there are other things to be read in man. But people don't dare to - they don't dare to turn the page. Laws of imitation! Laws of fear, I call them. The fear of finding oneself alone - that is what they suffer from - and so they don't find themselves at all. 		Gide
When I was younger, I used to make resolutions which imagined were virtuous. I was less anxious to be what I was, than to become what I wished to be. Now, I am not far from thinking that in irresolution lies the secret of not growing old. 		Gide
I have always thought that great artists were those who dared to confer the right of beauty on things so natural that people say on seeing them,&quot;Why did I never realize before that that was beautiful too?&quot; 		Gide
No longer ask me for my program: isn't breathing one? 		Cioran
We say of space, of time, and of suffering that they are infinite; but &quot;infinite &quot; has no more bearing than &quot;beautiful &quot;&quot;sublime &quot;&quot;harmonious &quot;&quot;ugly'... Suppose we force ourselves to see to the bottom of words? We see nothing &#; each of them, detached from the expansive and fertile soul, are null and void. The intelligence functions by projecting a certain lustre upon them, polishing them and making them glitter; this power, erected into a system, is called &quot;culture &quot; &#; pyrotechnics against a night sky of nothingness. 		Cioran
Ideas should be neutral. But man animates them with his passions and folly. Impure and turned into beliefs, they take on the appearance of reality. The passage from logic is consummated. Thus are born ideologies, doctrines, and bloody farce. 		Cioran
To tell the truth, I couldn't care less about the relativity of knowledge; the world does not deserve to be known. 		Cioran
My mission is to see things as they are. Exactly the contrary of a mission. 		Cioran
Read day and night, devour books&#; these sleeping pills&#; not to know but to forget! Through books you can retrace your way back to the origins of spleen, discarding history and its illusions. 		Cioran
The poor, by thinking unceasingly of money, reach the point of losing the spiritual advantages of non-possession, thereby sinking as low as the rich. 		Cioran
Basis of society: anonymous sweat. 		Cioran
Each time I fail to think about death, I have the impression of cheating, of deceiving someone in me. 		Cioran
Lord, give me the capacity of never praying, spare me the insanity of all worship, let this temptation of love pass from me which would deliver me forever unto You. Let the void spread between my heart and heaven! I have no desire to people my deserts by Your presence, to tyrannize my nights by Your light, to dissolve my Siberias beneath Your sun. 		Cioran
In every man sleeps a prophet, and when he wakes there is a little more evil in the world. 		Cioran
Losing love is so rich a philosophical ordeal that it makes a hairdresser into a rival of Socrates. 		Cioran
Is it possible that existence is our exile, and nothingness our home? 		Cioran
When we know what words are worth, the amazing thing is that we try to say anything at all, and that we manage to do so. This requires, it is true, a supernatural nerve. 		Cioran
A picture is worth 10,000 words - but only those used to describe the picture. Hardly any sets of 10,000 words can be adequately described with pictures 		Perlis

Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it. 		Perlis
In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be reborn. 		Perlis
Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon bra and fig-leaf. 		Perlis

Wherever there is modularity there is the potential for misunderstanding: Hiding information implies a need to check communication. 		Perlis

One can only display complex information in the mind. Like seeing, movement or flow or alteration of view is more important than the static picture, no matter how lovely. 		Perlis
Once you understand how to write a program get someone else to write it. 		Perlis
Some cathedrals took a century to complete. Can you imagine the grandeur and scope of a program that would take as long? 		Perlis
The goal of computation is the emulation of our synthetic abilities, not the understanding of our analytic ones. 		Perlis
Because of its vitality, the computing field is always in desperate need of new cliches: Banality soothes our nerves. 		Perlis
In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living definition of the word &quot;frustration'. 		Perlis

Few things have happened to me, but I've read of many. Or simply: few things have happened to me more worth remembering than Schopenhauer's thought or the verbal music of England. 		Borges
Heaven and hell seem out of proportion to me: the actions of men do not deserve so much. 		Borges
It is adventurous to think that a mere coordination of words (and philosophies are nothing but that) may resemble the universe very much. It is also adventurous to think that, of all these illustrious coordinations, one of them does not — at least infinitesimally — resemble the universe a bit more than the others. 		Borges
A man sets out to draw the world. As the years go by, he peoples a space with images of provinces, kingdoms, mountains, bays, ships, islands, fishes, rooms, instruments, stars, horses, and individuals. A short time before he dies, he discovers that the patient labyrinth of lines traces the lineaments of his own face. 		Borges
the night pleases us because it suppresses idle details, like memory does. 		Borges
There is a concept which corrupts and upsets all others. I refer not to Evil, whose limited realm is that of ethics; I refer to the infinite. 		Borges
They seek neither truth nor likelihood; they seek astonishment. They think metaphysics is a branch of the literature of fantasy. 		Borges
Famously, when Whistler was asked how long it took him to paint one of his nocturnes, he answered:&quot;All of my life'. With the same rigor he could have said that all the centuries preceding were necessary. From that correct application of the law of causality it follows that the slightest event presupposes all the inconceivable universe and, conversely, that the universe needs even the slightest of events. 		Borges
[God to the leopard]:&quot;a man I know will look at you at a certain number of times and will not forget and will put your figure and symbol in a poem, which poem has a precise place in the plot of the universe. You have been captive, but you thus have given a word to this poem.&quot; God, in the leopard's dream, illuminated the animal's vulgarity, and so the leopard understood and accepted his fate; but when he awoke, there was only in him a dark resignation, a courageous ignorance; for the machinery of the world is too complex for the simplicity of a beast...<br>In a dream, God declared to Dante the secret purpose of his life and work; Dante, in wonderment, knew at last who and what he was, and blessed all the bitterness of his life... upon waking, he felt that he had received and lost an infinite thing, something he would not recover or even glimpse, for the machinery of the world is too complex for the simplicity of a man. 		Borges
...the writer's life is a solitary one; you think it's just you; but, as the years go by, if your stars are propitious, you discover you are at the center of a vast circle of invisible friends - friends you will never know, but who love you, and this is more than enough reward. 		Borges
The Dada movement corresponded to a nihilistic idea, to the desperation of literature. Later we were disappointed to find that they were not true skeptics, that they were all fighting to be recognized as the &quot;true &quot; founder of the movement. In short, we learned that the Dadaists were just writers, as professional as any other: equally jealous, equally vain. 		Borges
we live out our lives putting off all that can be put off; perhaps we all know deep down that we are immortal and that sooner or later all men will do and know all things. 		Borges
There is a line in Verlaine I won't recall again,<br>There's a street close by, forbidden to my feet,<br>There's a mirror that's seen me for the last time,<br>There's a door I have locked til the end of the world.<br>Of the books in my library (all before me)<br>There are some I'll never open.<br>This summer I complete my fiftieth year;<br>Death gnaws at me ceaselessly.		Borges

Someone might say I have only made a bouquet of other people's flowers, supplying nothing of my own but the thread to bind them... But, if you embrace the opinions of [others] through reason, they will no longer be their opinions, they will be yours too... Truths are held in common by all, and no more belong to those that uttered them first than to him that repeats them later. It's no more &quot;according to Plato...&quot; than &quot;according to me...&quot; since he and I both understand it. Bees plunder flowers, but they do so after honey, which is afterwards all theirs; it is no longer thyme or marjoram. So too with parts borrowed from others: you transform and mingle them, and so make a work entirely yours - namely, your judgment. 	Montaigne
