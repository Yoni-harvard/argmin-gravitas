Usually, we think of charity as something it's nice to do, but people wouldn't say you were doing anything wrong by spending all your money on yourself. It's your money, after all.<br><br>

There's a different way of seeing things. Here's an argument that it's wrong to <i>not</i> give to charity:<br><br>

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Argument #1: </h3>
	<div>
	<ol>
		<li>Many people suffer terrible diseases which are cheap to cure.</li><br>
			
		<li>If we can prevent something bad from happening, without giving up anything important, we should.</li><br>
			
		<li>I can prevent people dying by giving more to effective organisations. </li><br>
			
		<li>By giving more to effective charities than I do, I would not be sacrificing anything important.</li><br>
			
		<li>Therefore, I should give more to effective charities.</li><a name="two"></a>
	</ol>
	</div>
</div>
<br>

Quite a few groups act out some version of this, in the form of 'tithing': you can see it in <a href="{{joe}}">Mormonism</a>, <a href="{{mooms}}">Islam</a> and <a href="{{joos}}">Judaism</a>. One group, the <a href="{{eaa}}">strong consequentialists</a>, go further though:
<br><br>

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Argument #2</h3>
	<div>
		<ol>
			<li>Many people suffer terrible diseases which are cheap to cure, and this is really bad.</li><br>

		<li>If we can prevent bad things without giving up anything equally important, we ought to.</li><br>

		<li>It is in our power to cure instances of disease.

			<ul>
				<li>Most rich-world people have enough disposable income for many suffering people.</li>
				<li>There <a href="{{top}}">are</a> organisations who deliver healthcare amazingly efficiently.</li>
			</ul>
		</li><br>

		<li>My having luxuries is not as important as the fatal preventable disease of others.</li><br>

		<li>Therefore, give away whatever you earn, after you've bought necessities for yourself.</li>
		</ol><br>

	<div class="accordion">
		<h3>What's the difference?</h3>
		<div>
			The change is in line (2): it points out that, even if it's important to me to visit my friend who lives across the globe in Japan, it's not <i>as</i> important as someone else's life or death. And that this difference should affect my actions.
		</div>
	</div>

	</div>

This line of reasoning leads quickly to something much rarer: the idea of a <i>maximum</i> wage. Call the amount of money a strong consequentialist is allowed the <i>maximum consequentialist income</i> (MCI).<br><br>

Three ideas for how to calculate the MCI  <a href="#fn:100" id="fnref:100">100</a>:<br><br>

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>A: Give yourself the world average.</h3>
	<div>
		First let's try to calculate the MCI from the top-down. Since I'm no <i>less</i> worthy of consideration than anyone else, perhaps it's as simple as allocating oneself the global average income. <br /><br />
		<ul>
		<li>What's the average world income?: Something like <b>£6,486</b> ($<a href="{{worldPounds}}">74</a><a href="http://www.economist.com/news/economic-and-financial-indicators/21586611-world-gdp">tn</a> / <a href="http://www.census.gov/popclock/">7.13bn</a> / £).<br><br> 

		But using the mean is ridiculous, because it puts too much weight on the unbelievably rich. If we take the median instead we get the abysmal <b>£1,772</b> at PPP. <a href="#fn:99" id="fnref:99">99</a></li><br />


		As you've probably noticed, this method has gone off the rails already: for a start, the most saintly (or monstrous) utilitarian must accept not the median but the <i>marginal</i> income ($<b>730</b> <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.2DAY">a year</a>). But much more because no-one can begin to live independently on £2000 a year, in Britain, except via homelessness or backwoods survivalism, neither of which conduce to many effective altruist jobs. (So the Singer principle is breached, and we try something else.)<br /><br />Of course this impossibility (even when you adjust for purchasing power) is the <i>point</i> about poverty, or 'average world income' as we're calling it. 
		<br>

		<li>If that were not bad enough, there are also hard limits to the aggregate amount we should give, and these fall well before the marginal utility limit (at which we’re no better off than those we’re helping). There are least three large rule-utilitarian problems with a whole society becoming Singerian:</li>
		</ul>
		
		<ol>
		<li><i style="font-style: italic;">Economic sustainability for donors. </i>We're imagining an effective 75% <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance">remittance</a> rate: the economic destructiveness of this cannot be overstated. A massive increase in giving is also a decrease by orders of magnitude in consumer spending, and so a proportionately tinier economy (millions of lost jobs, deflation, brain drain). There's also the foregone replacement of depleted capital stock, estimated at "11%" a year for Britain, whatever that means (chart 28 <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/events/pdf/conferences/oulton.pdf">here</a>) 200bn? I concede this point (as does Singer by the way), though the more idealistic of us can argue there’d be non-negligible positive effects from decreasing consumption, if the change was gradual enough. (Think about the environment alone.) When conceded, this leads to the oldest sticking point in the distributive book: the smaller slice of the bigger pie. We might give more overall with 15% of GNP than 40%, since total GNP would be that much bigger (and the country would still <i>be there</i> the following year). Where the line should be drawn is legendarily hard to say. </li>
		<br>

		<li>Perverse effects for recipients. Resource flows just one percent as large as the donation from hypothetical hyper-altruist Britain have in the past had '<a href="http://www.bupedu.com/lms/admin/uploded_file/The%20Samaritan's%20Dilemma.pdf">hundreds</a>' of severe perverse <a href="http://www.peterleeson.com/SamaritanReview.pdf">economic effects</a>, from inflation to corruption to civil war. We sidestep this somewhat by emphasising that our work would be evidence-based (the 'effective' bit in effective altruism), but that much money is very unpredictable and genuinely hazardous.</li><br>

		<li><i>Cultural decline</i><i>. </i>Don't underestimate this; what becomes of culture, if no one pays for gigs or exhibits or such? (Even DIY nonprofit things rely on somebody willing to make a loss.) The consequentialist should be careful not to tear up all other kinds of value in pursuing economic justice, and become a mere 'machine for the redistribution of wealth'.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<br><br />But these are irrelevant for our decision, since we can safely assume that we're acting 'at the margin', where there will be no mass movement toward radical giving.<br /><br />

		One issue which does need solving now is the <i>problem of composition</i>. Note first that we <i>know</i> that the NGO <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a> can deworm someone for <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative#Whatdoyougetforyourdollar">$1.28</a> including admin - a permanent substantial boost to one person's health, nutrition, and mental performance. Nothing I can get for myself can match this. (Nothing I could spend $1,000 on could.) So, naively it seems that any figure I set for the MCI could be eroded further, a dollar at a time, by applying the marginal utility rule - "Is this pie worth more to me than a deworming to someone in need? <i>No</i>." (ad infinitum). 

		<br><br>

		The answer is to reject the use of marginal utility on its own; you need to derive a minimum baseline first. On to which:<br />

	</div>

	<h3>B: Give yourself the cost of necessities.</h3>
	<div>
		Let's try from the bottom-up instead, adding<i> </i>basic annual costs, again for a childless Briton in OK health living in the average town:<br /><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Rent: £2700. <a href="#fn:101" id="fnref:101">101</a></li>
			<li>Food: £1800 <a href="#fn:102" id="fnref:102">102</a></li>
			<li>Toiletries: £100? <a href="#fn:103" id="fnref:103">103</a></li>
			<li>Clothes: £100. <a href="#fn:107" id="fnref:107">107</a>. </li>
			<li>Bills: £1100 <a href="#fn:104" id="fnref:104">104</a></li>
			<li>Transport: £1300. <a href="#fn:105" id="fnref:105">105</a></li>
			<li>'Participation' (going out, gifts, misc): £500. <a href="#fn:109" id="fnref:109">109</a></li><br>

			<li><big>MCI = <b>£7400</b> + tax</big> <a href="#fn:106" id="fnref:106">106</a></li>
		</ul>

	<br>
	Surprisingly neat. Of course most British people would consider this anti-poverty measure to be poverty. But that's an abuse of the word. This does propose you live a student life forever, but that's the price of virtue by these lights.<br />

	</div>

	<h3>C: Give yourself a 'living wage'</h3>
	<div>
		We could accept the estimates of rich-world activists for a rich-world 'living wage'. Lovely people like the <a href="http://www.jrf.org.uk/focus-issue/minimum-income-standards">Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.minimumincome.org.uk/">MIS</a> calculate a decent domestic minumum of about £16,000 (at 2013 prices). 

		<br><br>In pushing in the direction of the much lower MCI, we might seem to oppose the push for better wages for working-class British people (who are nonetheless, and at worst, still in the <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/why-give/how-rich-am-i">global top 20%</a>).<br><br> 

		But thinking that the money should <i>come from</i> the lower end of the income spectrum is the same terrible mistake that people who rant about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/01/welfare-fraud-tax-avoidance">benefit scrounging instead of tax avoidance</a> make: there's a vast amount of room for far less harmful redistribution at the top end.<br /><br />

		The calculator <a href="http://www.minimumincome.org.uk/">here</a> gives the UK living wage as £16,852 for a singleton, at minimum (though it doesn't handle the flat-sharing setup I used in [B]). This is the amount polled British people think one can really live on - "participating fully in the economic, social, and political life of the society in which they live".<br><br> 

		Who am I to say this is 'too much'? <br><br>

		Well it's not too much. In fact it's not enough, given most people's life goals. It's just that the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative's <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative#Whatdoyougetforyourdollar">$1</a> offer remains, and really should force you to think about how much you actually need another holiday. Using method B's baseline instead of the above living wage is equivalent to giving 4,800 more children, every year.<br /><br>
	</div>
</div>

<br>
Well, what was the point of that? Does anyone actually live like this? <br><br> 


<a href="{{ord}}">A few</a> <a href="{{jeffGive}}">do</a>, yes. But I always get annoyed by people who dismiss consequentialism for being too demanding: why <i>should</i> it be easy to take the best course of action? Even if it was impossible for humans to live like this (and it is not), it would be extremely valuable information, to know how far from the best course I am trailing.<br>
