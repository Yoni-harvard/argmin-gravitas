    Grit
        An addiction to easy solutions can become a crippling liability if your entire strategy is based around finding them where they don't exist.

    FIRE
        we’re best off relying on intuition alone pretty much only in these 4 cases: when a decision is Fast, Irrelevant, Repetitious, or Evolutionary (F.I.R.E for short).

    Clutter
        clutter (e.g. papers on our desks) harms our attention, and that we need to make large changes to the clutter to observe the effects (a 10% reduction in distractions is hard to notice, but a 90% reduction in distractions should produce twice the benefit of an 80% reduction).
        I’m skeptical that standard notions of clutter affect my attention much, so I didn’t follow the standard version of that advice. My attention seems much more affected by tasks / events that I expect to do over the next few days (or have done recently). I seem to “see” these in much the way many people see papers on their desk (or email in their inbox) as something to do.
        Last year I made a little progress at reducing “temporal clutter”, e.g. by writing down my plans for what to cook (writing them down made them seem more real, so that I felt less need to re-evaluate them).

    SJ emotions
        valid emotion: one that makes sense. All emotions are valid, because all emotions occur for reasons connected to particular situations.
        justified emotion: one that “corresponds” to the situation that prompted it.
        effective emotion: one that gets you the thing you want. Being angry will not cause the traffic to move any faster, make you unhappy.

        == Deep work 
        in the morning
        Preparation: 
            Add a flourish
        Do the hardest thing first.
        into the smallest number of biggest chunks you can
        Where you’ll work.
        How long you will work.
        What you’ll do (i.e. ‘no internet’, ‘no email’, etc.)
        Focus on ‘Lead’ measures. 
            tend to be processes (e.g. I will spend 4 hours each day writing maths papers)
            Lag measure: I published 4 papers
        Shutdown at 7pm?
        Whitelist stack overflow and google?
    + Generate momentum
        If I can’t figure out how to solve some problem:
            Write down the problem in as much detail as possible.
            Write down what exactly would constitute a solution.
            Write down why I need to solve this problem and why I can’t just do something simpler.
            Write down a list of examples and try to solve each one by hand.
            Write down any problems other people have solved that seem related. See if the solutions can be adapted.
            Write down problems that are similar but easier. Try to solve those.
            Open up How To Solve It and try each of the heuristics.
            Explain all of the above to someone else.
        If I can’t decide what to do:
            Write down the problem.
            Write down the criteria by which I should judge each option.
            Write down all the options I can think of.
            Write down the pros and cons of each.
            If possible, go do something else instead.
            Otherwise, start a 30 minute timer and at the end pick the least bad option still on the list.
        If I don’t know where to start:
            List all the things that need to happen, in time order.
            If the first thing on the list is something I can do, do it.
            Otherwise, take the first thing on the list and break it down into smaller steps.
    + Before commenting:
        1) Am I interpreting someone's claim in a more unreasonable way than they meant it, and neglecting to search for more reasonable interpretations before responding?
        2) Sheer carelessness. Like, reading quickly and missing an important caveat, or failing to check for context
        3) Assuming we're talking about the same thing just because using the same word
        4) Citing a fact that I've heard others claim, without checking it myself, and learning they were wrong or I misremembered
    + Questions 
        What are the important problems; what's stopping you from working on them?
        What constitutes my happiness?

            What proportion of my time?

        What have I gained in the past year? In what ways am I augmented? How do I feel about that?
        What have I lost in the past year? In what ways am I diminished? How do I feel about that?
        What new beliefs? What practical consequences? What does it imply?
        What would I be, if I had centuries? What stands in my way? What will I need? 
        How did you use your cognitive surplus?

                Reflecting 1
                    Make log from yesterday
                        Summarize the time
                            For each of ~8 categories, count how much time went into that category.
                                Particularly things I'm curious about.
                                Time working.
                                Transport.
                                Various categories of relaxing.
                                Eating, and other stuff for staying alive.
                                Etc.
                        Put stuff into project time logs
                            For each project, record how much time I spent on it today.
                            Record what I got done. 
                        Make notes comparing what got done to the goals.
                    Reflections
                        Did anything in particular go wrong? 
                            For anything you wanted to do and didn't, was there a problem with that task?
                            Were there any more general problems?
                            In retrospect should you have done anything differently?
                        How did the day go?
                            How happy was I? What parts of the day were good, which were productive, etc.
                        Spend a minute searching for something to improve.
                            Generate at least a proposal for something to improve. 
                Reflecting 2
                    Manage reminders.
                        Look at my 'by event' section and see if any of the conditions obtain.
                        Look over tagged reminders from yesterday and process them.
                            #note Throughout the day I will create items with today's date as their tag, e.g. dec9. 
                            #note For each of them, they are either something I should put into my todo list, or something I should be reminded of.
                            #note I either put them in my todo list, think about them and decide I don't need to be reminded of them again, or replace their tag with some future day's tag (when I'll be reminded of them again)
                            #note in principle this system is redundant with the reminder inbox, but in practice one or the other is often more convenient.
                        Go to http://www.catch.com
                            #note I treat notes from my phone the same way as items with the day's tag.
                        Check email inbox, and turn anything unanswered into a todo item
                        Go through my todo inbox, and put each thing into some category.. 
                    Prepare for tomorrow
                        Make a copy of the template day
                        Import tasks for tomorrow from 'tasks' to tomorrow's todo list.
                        Look over my calendar for tomorrow, and decide what else I want to do.
                            Estimate the time for everything.
                            If you don't think you'll finish all the todo items, redistribute them now. 
                            Look at the 'next steps' for all projects, and decide what to do on them.
                    General reflections on today if any?
                        #note I write down things about the day that I might forget before tomorrow.
                    Put things in beeminder (or figure out when you will)
                Night
                    Look at my calendar for tomorrow.
                    [Other things I want to do each night.]
                    Move today's info to my log.
                    0-10 how was your day?
            Logs
                #note (this section gets populated by some of the checklists I use during the day; the rest of the notes just say what ends up going here)
                #note I copy {Today's Date} here at the end of the day
                #note I move 'time log' and 'pomodoros' into the day.
                #note I take ~3 minutes to go through the time log and divide up the day's time into categories.
                #note I look over the day and reflect on anything noteworthy.  
        {Today's Date}

            + other things I want to get done today.
                Items from my todo list.
                Commitments during the day.
                Other work.
            Time estimates for each thing.

        Pomodoros
            #note A list of all the pomodoros I've done through the day. Each time I finish a pomodoro I make a note here.
            #note At the end of the day I put the totals into Beeminder
            #note I also track what I did in each, and I update my project time logs periodically.

    evo on the crucible
        eliminate your attachment to beliefs about yourself and your plans. 
            Not "notice the emotion, feel how it affects you, try to debias": Remove it. Are you smart? Will this project succeed? When are you going to die? Do you have any chance at all of accomplishing anything?
            Most people incapable of dispassionately considering these questions, and as a result they flounder. Projects drag on, costs get sunk, people develop massive guilt spirals about whether or not they’re good enough, it becomes impossible to reconsider your current course, and nothing useful gets done.
        Emptying yourself of these emotional attachments lets you take a much more strategic approach to your plans, more like a game player than a game piece, and leads to much better plans overall.

        3. Identify the Obstacle(s)
            Imagine the obstacle, again letting your thoughts wander and lead your writing. Think of an obstacle that may hold you back, something that you have at least partial control over. How might you get in your own way? What kind of external situations should you do your best to avoid or plan for in advance?
        4. Devise a Plan to overcome that obstacle
            “To create a plan, first write down one specific action you can take to overcome the obstacle. Write down the time and place where you believe the obstacle will arise. Then write down the if-then plan: ‘If obstacle x occurs (when and where), then I will perform behavior y.’ Repeat it once to yourself out loud.”

Heuristic Decisions Whenever you are hesitant about a decision, force yourself to decide in advance. If you can guess your answer, then, in all probability, your System-1 has already decided. Once an idea enters your mind it stays there for we rarely change our minds. Don’t accept intuitions as definitive answers and make an actual effort to think for yourself.Murphyjitsu  imagine a worst-case scenario already happened: force yourself to come up with an explanation why that happened. Not one unusual thing has ever happened    Feelings of surreality and bizarreness are products of having poor models of reality. Reality is not inherently weird. Weirdness is a state of mind, not a quality of reality. If at any point some truth should seem shocking or bizarre, it’s your brain that labels it as such. If the real world seems utterly strange or surreal to your intuitions — then it’s your intuitions that need to change. The map is not the territory.Mysterious Answers   When thinking about a mystery and trying to devise a solution, the probable solution must make the mystery less confusing. It is not enough that the proposed hypothesis is falsifiable; it must also destroy the mystery itself. Because if it doesn’t, then why should your hypothesis have priority over any other?Loss Aversion and Risk-seeking behavior   For the human mind, losses are more prominent than gains. This has an evolutionary origin as organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance at survival and reproduction. The “loss aversion ratio” has been estimated in several experiments and is, on average, usually in the range of 1.5 to 2.5. Loss Aversion is the source of a wide array of cognitive biases that make people take irrational choices when assessing risk and so one must diligently use System-2 to fight it. Even though Loss Aversion is a prominent fact of human cognition, there are certain instances where humans are biased to be risk seeking. In general, humans are Loss-Averse when assessing risk in the realm of possible gains but jump into risk-seeking behavior when assessing loses. Economic logic dictates the opposite. We should be Risk-Seeking when facing possible gains and Loss-Averse when faced with loses. A failure to abide to this rule results in long-term costs.

    Adjusting to the real probability   System-1 emotional intuitions get biased when presented with probabilities. We fail to anchor our emotions to the actual number. There are two specific effects one must be wary about:     
        The Possibility Effect: This is when highly improbable outcomes are overweighed by System-1. This is due loss aversion. When faced with a pair of “losing choices”, System-1 is biased to prefer to gamble for huge gains, even at the expense of terrible loses, than accept a loss. This causes a 5% chance to be disproportionately weighted against a 0% chance.        

        The Certainty Effect: This is when highly probable outcomes are underweighted by System-1. This is due to risk aversion. When people are faced with a certain but inferior choice opposed to a highly probable and superior one, their intuitions are biased to pick the certain option. For instance, a 5% difference between a 95% choice and a 100% feels like too much a risk. Whatever the probability presented, we must adjust our decision to said probability according to the expected utilities. This is completely counterintuitive and must be enforced by System-2.
    
    Fear of Regret     source of risk-aversion avoiding decision in favor of a safe one where no regret would be evoked.   effect is stronger when the negative outcome is the product of action rather than inaction.     people expect to have a stronger emotional reaction (including regret) to active outcome.   translates into a general aversion to trading increased risk for advantage, which can affect institutional risk-taking policies. To counter this bias, regret must not be factored when making a decision about risk.
