			My friend Hugh was convinced that linear models should be able to match decision tree ensembles in many places, and we had both seen stuff like depth-12 trees used in industry, which just don't make sense on a naive account.<br><br> 

			We contrived a few neat stochastic processes to test a few ways that the depth of the trees could be helping with various realistic data flaws. Turns out that  There's also a couple of simple extensions to Gaussian mixture modelling with lines.<br><br>

			Our linear fixes didn't work that well on randomly selected real data though.<br><br>
