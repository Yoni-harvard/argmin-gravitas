			We looked at how policy effects changed in the second wave (late 2020). This time we did it at a finer level, with the unit roughly 1/20 of a country rather than whole countries.<br><br>
			
			Policies got a bit weaker overall (66% combined reduction, compared to 80% in Spring). The best reading of this is that all the safety measures and individual protective behaviour persisted after the first wave, even when the government said it was ok to stop.<br><br>

			School closure was notably weaker (10% instead of 35%). This probably means that the safety measures enforced since Spring really did make them safer.<br><br>
