			We try to work around the famous impossibility results in algorithmic fairness, by using legal damages as a signal about all-things-considered unfairness. This lets us use multiple definitions of fairness at once and set the weight on each in a non-arbitrary way.<br><br>

			A human picks a set of fairness definitions; A human gives the algorithm a set of past cases, along with the damages awarded in each case; LGFO works out how much weight to give each kind of fairness, and so produces a classifier which is relatively fair, if we trust the legal system to know this relatively well.
