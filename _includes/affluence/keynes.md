## Explaining the Work Surplus

> there is no country and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and of abundance without a dread. For we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy. It is a fearful problem for the ordinary person, with no special talents, to occupy himself... To judge from the behaviour and the achievements of the wealthy classes today in any quarter of the world, the outlook is very depressing! 

> For many ages to come the old Adam will be so strong in us that everybody will need to do some work if he is to be contented... <span style="font-weight:bold">Three-hour shifts or a fifteen-hour week</span> may put off the problem for a great while. For three hours a day is quite enough to satisfy the old Adam in most of us!

i.e. Keynes claimed something like "by 2030, average working hours will have fallen more than 68%". <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>

This prediction, that by the mid-C21st working hours would collapse (leaving a 15-hour week as an artifically _inflated_ amount), is often derided as a failed prediction or lamented as a missed opportunity / a sign of our demented civilisation. 

But Keynes was actually correct in one sense: the number of hours for subsistence _has_ fallen this much; it _is_ in fact possible to live this way. At current part-time UK median wage, 15h/week gets you about £7500 a year. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> This is <a href="{{pov}}">relative poverty</a>, not easy to live on even for a frugal single person. It rules out many classes of consumer goods, like cars, international travel, and children. But I've done it, for a few years anyway. Eerily, the average full-time 1928 annual income was <a href="{{avg28}}">£7600 (£131)</a>!

Not withstanding the <a href="{{ny}}">complaints of elite parents</a> doing crazy amounts of unpaid unofficial work, working hours are down a lot, about 20% <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a> (rather than Keynes' 68% fall), and the fall in household chores is exactly right (about 72% down):

So why _don't_ we trade our current income for massive amounts of free time plus a modest improvement over 1928 average?

I used to struggle a lot with this fact. "People must be greedy." "People must be brainwashed." "People must be forced into it by top-down capitalist or bottom-up <a href="{{veb}}">status pressure</a>." But Keynes has a much simpler hypothesis: despite appearances, people actually quite like work - or rather they like the meaning, mastery, routine, and social status involved.

Maybe Keynes' actual mistake was thinking that we only needed a little of it, that we'd learn to do without it and learn how to make use of freedom.


1. Scaling demand for consumption. <!-- Adaptive preferences. Hedonic treadmill.  -->
2. Positional goods
3. Employment as status symbol
4. False consciousness 
5. Intrinsic preference for work over leisure

Edmund Phelps: "most, if not all, of the attainable self-realization in modern societies can come only from career... people need to exercise their minds with novel challenges - new problems to solve, new talents to develop... The fact that work has not come to an end... is strong evidence of the fallaciousness of the Keynes-Ramsey theory of what people want and where... societies are headed".

<!-- Danaher automation - will have to shift the culture -->

This is a hard truth for me, because Keynes' idea of the future is so congenial: that we would throw away the dreadful ladder we have climbed; that we would, one day, have all become rich enough to live freely.

> All kinds of social customs and economic practices... which we now maintain at all costs, however distasteful and unjust they may be in themselves, because they are tremendously useful in promoting the accumulation of capital, we shall then be free, at last, to discard... We shall once more value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful.
