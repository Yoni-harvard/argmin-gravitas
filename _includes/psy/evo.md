* Weak evidence for <span class="b">romantic priming</span>, that looking at attractive women increases men's conspicuous consumption, time discount, risk-taking. Weak, despite there being _43_ independent confirmatory studies!: one of the strongest publication biases / p-hacking ever found.

* Questionable evidence for the menstrual cycle version of the <span class="b">dual-mating-strategy hypothesis</span> (that "heterosexual women show stronger preferences for uncommitted sexual relationships [with more masculine men]... during the high-fertility ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, while preferring long-term relationships at other points"). Studies are usually tiny (median n=34, mostly over one cycle). Funnel plot looks ok though.

		the specific menstrual cycle research doesn't seem to replicate well. However, to my knowledge the basic pattern of short vs long term relationship goals predicting [women's] masculinity preferences is still robust.
