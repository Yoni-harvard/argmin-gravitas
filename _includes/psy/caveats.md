	<h3>Selection criteria</h3>
	<div>
		I include a claim if there was at least one of: several failed replications, several good meta-analyses with notably smaller <i>d</i>, very strong publication bias, clear fatal errors in the analysis, a formal retraction, or clear fraud. <br><br>
<!--  -->
		I also include cases like <a href="{{dw}}">growth mindset</a>, where the eventual effect size, though positive, was a tiny fraction of the hyped original claim.<br><br>
<!--  -->
		I compare to the original paper's effect size because I am lazy and barely capable of the better alternative, a careful averaging of high-quality supporting papers.<br><br>
<!--  -->
		Thousands of bad papers are published every year, and catching them all would be a full-time job even if they were all included in systematic replication or reanalysis projects, ripe fruit. My rule is that if I hear a spurious effect discussed, or see it in a book, or if it could hurt someone, it's noteworthy.
	</div>
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
	<h3>Why trust replications more than originals?</h3>
	<div>
		Near-universal rates of <a href="{{preg}}">pre-registration</a> and higher rates of code and data sharing. (For "<a href="{{direct}}">direct</a>" replications, the original target study has in effect pre-registered their hypotheses, methods, and analysis plan.)<br><br>
<!--  -->
		But I don't trust any of them. I look for 3+ failed replications from different labs, just to save me lots of rewriting, as the garden of forking paths and the mystery of the lefty p-curve unfold.
