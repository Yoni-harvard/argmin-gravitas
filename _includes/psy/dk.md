	<h3>First disambiguate the claim</h3>
	<div>
		5 claims involved, three of which are just popular misunderstandings:
		<br><br> 
		<span style="font-weight:bold">1)</span> the one the authors actually make: that poor performers (e.g. the bottom quartile) overestimate their performance more than good performers do: $$L > U$$ <!-- $$\hat{P}_{q_L} - P_{q_L} > \hat{P}_{q_U} - P_{q_U}$$  -->

		</center>
		<br>
		(Formally "the difference \( \hat{P} - P \) has a negative slope over actual peformance moderator".)
		<br><br>
		<!--  -->
		<span style="font-weight:bold">2)</span> that people <a href="{{sup}}">in general</a> overestimate their own ability \( \hat{P} > P \)
		<br><br>
		<!--  -->
		<span style="font-weight:bold">3)</span> the meme: that there's a <a href="{{mtstupid}}">u-shaped relationship</a> between perceived and actual ability. "The less competent someone is, the more competent they think they are".

		</center><br>
		<!-- $$\hat{P} \simeq f(1/P) \,\,\, \mathrm{for} \,\, P < q_M$$ -->
		<span style="font-weight:bold">4)</span> Alternatively, that poor performers think they're better than good performers.

		</center><br>
		<!-- $$\hat{P}_{q_L}(q_L) > \hat{P}_{q_U}(q_L)$$ -->
		<span style="font-weight:bold">5)</span> the authors' explanation: that (1) is <i>caused by</i> a lack of 'metacognitive' skills, being able to reflect on your ability at the task. That it's a cognitive bias suffered by the worst at a task. <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a><br><br>
