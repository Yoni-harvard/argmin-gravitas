* No good evidence that brains contain <span class="b">one mind per hemisphere</span>. The corpus callosotomy studies which purported to show "two consciousnesses" inhabiting the same brain <a href="{{pinto}}">were badly overinterpreted</a>.<br><br>


* Very weak evidence for the existence of <span class="b">high-functioning</span> (IQ ~ 100) <span class="b">hydrocephalic people</span>. The hypothesis begins from extreme prior improbability; the effect of massive volume loss is claimed to be on average _positive_ for cognition; the case studies are often questionable and involve little detailed study of the brains (e.g. 1970 scanners were not capable of the precision claimed).
