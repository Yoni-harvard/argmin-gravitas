		4 claims involved:<br><br> 
	1) the one the authors actually make: that poor performers (e.g. the bottom quartile) overestimate their performance more than good performers do: $$\hat{P}_{q_L} - P_{q_L} > \hat{P}_{q_U} - P_{q_U}$$ 
	2) that people <a href="{{sup}}">in general</a> overestimate their own ability $$\hat{P} > P$$
	3) the meme: that there's a <a href="{{mtstupid}}">u-shaped relationship</a> between perceived and actual ability. "The less competent someone is, the more competent they think they are". $$\hat{P} \simeq f(1/P) \,\,\, \mathrm{for} \,\, P < q_M$$
	3b) Alternatively, that poor performers think they're better than good performers. $$\hat{P}_{q_L}(q_L) > \hat{P}_{q_U}(q_L)$$
	4) the authors' explanation: that (1) is due to a lack of 'metacognitive' skills, being able to reflect on your ability at the task.<br><br><br>

				<span class="b">Original effect size</span>: 2 of the 4 experiments showed a <i>positive</i> relationship between score and perceived ability; 2 showed no strong relationship.

				The original paper concedes that there's a <a href="{{dkmath}}">purely statistical</a> explanation for the effect they found: just that it is much easier to overestimate a low number which has a lower bound! And the converse: if I am a perfect performer, I am <i>unable</i> to overestimate myself. D&K just think there's something left when you subtract this. Also "<i>the primary drivers of errors in judging relative standing are general inaccuracy and overall biases tied to task difficulty</i>". (4) is shakier than (1).

			<li><span class="b">Replication effect size</span> (for claim (1)): 3 of the 4 original studies can be explained by noisy tests, bounded scales, and artefacts in the plotting procedure.

* Questionable evidence for the "<span class="b">hungry judge</span>" effect, of massively reduced acquittals (d=2) just before lunch. Case order isn't independent of acquittal probability ("unrepresented prisoners usually go last and are less likely to be granted parole"); favourable cases may take predictably longer and so are pushed until after recess; effect size is implausible on priors; explanation involved ego depletion.
