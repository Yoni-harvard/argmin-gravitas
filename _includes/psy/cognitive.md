* Questionable evidence for the "hungry judge" effect, of massively reduced acquittals (d=2) just before lunch. Case order isn't independent of acquittal probability ("unrepresented prisoners usually go last and are less likely to be granted parole"); favourable cases may take predictably longer and so are pushed until after recess; effect size is implausible on priors; explanation involved ego depletion.
