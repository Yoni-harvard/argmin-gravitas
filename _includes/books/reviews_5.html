It is as though these men were lifted out of history at a crucial turning point—from the age of conventional weapons to the nuclear era — placed within a timeless container and told to discuss their past and future as the recorders roll.</i></blockquote> - Jeremy Bernstein<br/><br/><br/>Astonishingly dramatic; also as pure as primary sources get. These reports were the result of months of secret eavesdropping on the German nuclear scientists, including after they hear of Hiroshima. Innocent of the microphones, the men concede their ignorance without ego, their character without any obfuscating propriety. (There are still two impurities: their words are both transcribed and translated by strangers. The physicists speak to us here in full sentences, with little of the fragmentariness and repetition of real speech. And it takes someone as highly trained as Bernstein to get us over the technical barrier.) Even so, this is as plain and self-interpreting as history gets. For six months they play madlibs, argue, and run around the garden, while the English and we listen in.<br/><br/>Hahn is a sweetheart and von Laue a droopy hero. The Party functionary Diebner is comic, even though he has most responsibility for the Nazi weapons project. Harteck is the most technically astute by far: he guesses a huge amount correctly, all in the teeth of loud ignorance by his more prestigious peers. von Weizsacker is the slimiest. Heisenberg is just <i>weird</i>: he has a very faint echo of the strange clear-sight-and-moral-vacuum of Eichmann. Enormous intelligence and no sense.<br/><br/><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VQ3rBmTP0Jk/WUUembjf4WI/AAAAAAAAC8c/8stKhuSGkHgL2uJ4gzfZl5y4PSDwuMB_wCLcBGAs/s1600/farmhall1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0"  data-src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VQ3rBmTP0Jk/WUUembjf4WI/AAAAAAAAC8c/8stKhuSGkHgL2uJ4gzfZl5y4PSDwuMB_wCLcBGAs/s400/farmhall1.png"  /></a></div><br/><br/>The morality of their wartime actions does not come up very much (except when raised by sweetheart Hahn or von Laue). They are mostly glad of the destruction of the Nazis, and Wirtz is horrified by the scale and singularity of SS murder. But the rest are more self-regarding than pro or anti Nazi. (Again, it is wonderful to read these and actually know they meant it.)<br/><br/>(What about the morality of our reading the reports? I don't have a clear opinion, but doing so after their deaths seems mostly fair.)<br/><br/>They very often speak about money, Heisenberg in particular. (Not just research funding or aid for their families in Occupied Germany, but dolla dolla bills.) On hearing that Hahn had won a Nobel:<br/><blockquote><i> "it says that you are supposed to receive the Nobel Prize for 1944." The excitement that struck the ten detainees at this moment is hard to describe in a few words. Hahn did not believe it at first. In the beginning he turned away all the offers of congratulations. But gradually we broke through, with Heisenberg in the lead, who congratulated him heartily on the 6200 pounds.<br/></i></blockquote> <br/><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cn_v4WT9cg4/WUUexaFbGdI/AAAAAAAAC8k/Encilxn-h3E3sQcRazdGfs8kNsdp_6mNQCLcBGAs/s1600/farmhall3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0"    data-src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cn_v4WT9cg4/WUUexaFbGdI/AAAAAAAAC8k/Encilxn-h3E3sQcRazdGfs8kNsdp_6mNQCLcBGAs/s400/farmhall3.png"  /></a></div><br/>As you can see, Bernstein's editorial voice is a bit strong. But his other qualities are huge and unique: he knew some of the protagonists personally, and worked on nuclear weaponry himself. He <i>is</i> out to get Heisenberg, and overreads a few times. But this is because people (Powers, Frayn to a degree) persist in rose-tinting him: there's this idea that Heisenberg feigned incompetence at reactor-making as anti-Nazi activism. The transcripts make clear that he'd have made a bomb if he could, not because he is a Nazi or a German but because he was amorally curious, and hungry for primacy. Heisenberg does object to Nazism. But not very strongly. <br/><br/>Bernstein's conclusion is that the project was pretty much a shambles. They had a two-year head start on the Allies, but failed for several reasons: they had < 1% of the funding of the Manhattan Project, an unbelievably bad administration and communication of data and ideas, and key resources like deuterium kept getting bombed. But Bernstein feels able to go for the jugular: <br/><blockquote><i> reading this lecture, I am once again struck by the intellectual thinness of this group. Here are ten German nuclear scientists — nine if one does not count von Laue — who are supposed to be the cream of the crop, the intellectual elite, of German nuclear physics, men who had been working on these questions for several years. And look at the discussion it produced.<br/><br/> To see what I have in mind, let us entertain the following fantasy. Suppose the tables had been turned and ten of the best Allied scientists had been interned in Göttingen when a hypothetical German atomic bomb went off. Whom shall we include? Fermi, Bethe, Feynman, Serber, Wigner, von Neumann, Oppenheimer, Peierls, Ulam, Teller, Bohr, Frisch, Weisskopf... What would the technical conversation have been like? No doubt there would have been disagreements and some fumbling. But like this? The question answers itself.</i></blockquote><br/>Yet <i>even with these handicaps</i>, it looks like Harteck could have built a basic pile in 1940, if the project was headed by someone less arrogant than Heisenberg. And that pile would have brought all the funding, and maybe sorted out their many collective muddles and lack of engineering care.<br/><br/><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rm6rozsP8oI/WU5mD4y91qI/AAAAAAAAC9U/Y7KjU-bOkdUgt39lfTwzdUIs6CYhF4FTwCLcBGAs/s1600/a%2Bbit%2Bmuch.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0"    data-src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rm6rozsP8oI/WU5mD4y91qI/AAAAAAAAC9U/Y7KjU-bOkdUgt39lfTwzdUIs6CYhF4FTwCLcBGAs/s640/a%2Bbit%2Bmuch.png"  /></a></div><br/><br/>5/5 for Bernstein's commentary and the hair-raising fact of their existence.</td>

      <td>Imagine someone great - I think of Bertrand Russell or Dan Dennett or CS Peirce or Alan Turing - writing really well about actually scientific self-help. Imagine they wrote most days for 2 years, and so distilled decades of trying to find the truth as a heavily biased primate barely out of the trees. Imagine it was empathic <i>and</i> well-justified with argument and experimental data. But imagine it turns out it wasn't a Canonical figure writing it, but instead some guy on the internet with no credentials and weird opinions. But imagine - or rather, I ask you to trust me, til you see for yourself - that the result matches what the greats achieved in the theory of practical reasoning. (Dennett actually wrote <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18378002-intuition-pumps-and-other-tools-for-thinking">a practical-reason how-to book</a>, and it isn't nearly as good.)<br/><br/><blockquote><i>These essays are fumbling attempts to put into words lessons better taught by experience.

      <td><i>Ficciones</i> (1944) by Jorge Luis Borges</td>
      <td>Deeply uncanny - without worshipping mystery. ("<a href="http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/0066/borges.pdf">Tlön</a>" is scarier to me than anything in Lovecraft. "<a href="http://libraryofbabel.info/Borges/libraryofbabel.pdf">Babel</a>" is also horrifying in its way.) Playing at the limits of reason - without renouncing objectivity. (There is something of the unearthly drama and transcendence of higher mathematics in a couple of these stories.) Somehow it manages to be cryptic without being annoying, to use literary gossip and the droning of archivists straight. Some of this is 80 years old, and it's still completely fresh.<br/><br/>He makes literature larger, by bringing new things into scope - bibliographic minutiae, English department arcana, salon gossip. There's something refreshing about his perfect fake book reviews. Gushing praise of nonexistent authors draws back the veil (as if our world's reviewers would say the same things whether or not the authors existed). <br/><br/>Borges was not a postmodernist but these anyway have the best of what postmodernism is taken to mean: nonliteral play, generative scepticism about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference">sense and reference</a> and language-games, reasoning about the limits of reason.<br/><br/>I'm not sure of the significance of some of Borges' sentences here. But for once the critic's working assumption of meaning seems sound: if I thought about it, I could find out. (And not just in the ordinary way, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">by projection</a>. I expect to find <i>Borges</i> in them if I try.)<br/><br/>I've some ideas about each story, but none that fit completely or exhaust them. Here's one:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Here's a banal idea: "language is composite". Characters go into words into sentences into works into worldviews. In "The Library of Babel", Borges stretches this fact until you see the horror in it, the <a href="http://www.singularitysymposium.com/exponential-growth.html">shocking</a> vastness of exponentiation on the tiny scale of a human life. The simple idea of mechanically generating all strings of length <i>n=1,312,000</i> leads to an incredibly claustrophobic closed system. The story is not 8 pages long but contains more than most books.<br/><br/>There exists one truth; there are uncountably many falsehoods; but worse, there's a far larger infinity of nonsense, of things which make sense in no language, which don't make enough sense to be false, which never will. This is the horror of Platonism or Many-world physics or Meinong: that we could be invisibly boxed-in by garbled infinities, endless keyboard mashing. The "noosphere" - all the good ideas, all the bad ideas ever had - is a tiny pocket of meaning in a sea of meaninglessness.<br/><br/>The stunning effect of "Babel" depends on its not being magic, not hand-wavy (merely monstrous, physically impossible for interesting reasons which violate no particular law). Ted Chiang is grasping at a similar titanic scale when he uses a truly alien language <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Story-Of-Your-Life">to explain variational physics</a>.<br/><br/>Remember that Borges was a librarian. But, while he said <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7572-i-have-always-imagined-that-paradise-will-be-a-kind">photogenic things</a> about libraries, he didn't necessarily like being in them. "The Library of Babel" adds an extremely mordant overtone to that quotation, by imagining an otherworldly library which breaks men just by being there. Sturrock, his biographer:<br/><blockquote><i>    Borges had some reason to dislike libraries because for nine years "of solid unhappiness", from 1937 to 1946, he was obliged to work in one, as a quite junior librarian, in order to make money. The cataloguing work he did was futile... </i></blockquote><br/><br/>The alphabet used for the Babel books has 22 letters and no uppercase. We could try and look up human languages with that many letters, but better to take this as a hint that our narrator is <i>not us</i> - he can be a total alien, far from Earth, and the exact same library will still confound him the exact same way. The same geometry constrains all minds. What looks like meaning need not be, if your sample is large enough:<br/><blockquote><i>This useless and wordy epistle itself already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves in one of the uncountable heaxgons - and so does its refutation. (And <i>n</i> possible languages make use of the <i>same</i> vocabulary; in some of them the symbol 'library' admits of the correct definition 'ubiquitous and everlasting system of hexagonal galleries', but 'library' is 'bread' or 'pyramid' of anything else... You who read me, are you sure you understand my language?) <br/></i></blockquote><br/>The narrator says that the fall from his floor "<i>is infinite</i>" (or indefinite), that the rooms are "<i>uncountable</i>", but we can do better than this quite easily, given only the text. There are 410*40*80 = 1312000 characters per book. The number of distinct books is thus (22 + 3)^{1312000} or about 2 followed by about 1.8 million zeroes. It is hard to give a reference for how large this is: if every atom in the universe contained as many atoms as are in the universe (10^80), and each of the nested atoms was a Babel book, this would still contain only a laughably tiny fraction of Babel, less than one googolplexth. There's 4*5*32 = 640 books per hexagon, so we need about 3 x 10^1834094 room-sized hexagons. This is the full implication of the simple thought "every book of length 1312000".<br/><br/>It couldn't possibly be even fractionally built. And yet, through the power of maths, <a href="http://libraryofbabel.info/book.cgi?0-w1-s1-v17:1">it has been built</a> - "only implicitly, skeletally", but it still counts.<br/><br/>(Borges notes this infinity/finity conflict on the last page, explaining that the Library is unbounded and periodic, a hypersphere.)<br/><br/>There is a beautiful, inspiring lesson to be taken from it actually: think about what the incredible feat of writing any book - no matter how bad - actually entails. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function">Our nervous system</a> shields us from Babel, from the larger part of possible meanings and the overwhelming majority of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">string</a> space. This is an astonishing act, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MwQRucYo6BZZwjKE7/einstein-s-arrogance">in information-theory terms</a>: the ultimate search, which we succeed at effortlessly, many times a day.

      <td><i>The Will to Battle (Terra Ignota, #3)</i> (2017) by Ada Palmer</td>
      <td>Sensational. Palmer <i>starts</i> in an Enlightenment utopia (post-war, post-nationalism, post-scarcity, post-gender, post-theocracy, post-fideism, post-meat, post-capital-punishment, post-nuclear-family, general justice via universal voluntary surveillance) and then shows what the tensions will do to any system that has to handle humans as we are.<br/><br/>Many riches. There are constantly five or so subplots on the go, and when one ends it spawns two others. Best are its careful sketches of deep divides: Tradition vs progress, act vs rule, order vs freedom, safety vs optimum return.<br/><br/>Some of the oppositions fall flat because I don't have the requisite respect for the other side. For instance <i>Damnatio memoriae</i> - the official expurgation of someone from history - is presented as an ultimate horror (the pain and execution preceding it is overwhelmingly more important). <br/><blockquote>[the damned person is] <i>neither slim nor mighty, stooped nor noble, just a shape... Somewhere in a dusty archive a baptismal registry records some Hildebrand, and, when that dry page molders... I can't look, I can't! Behind the shades, the broad gray plain, that sea of shapeless gloom extending on and on... all forgotten souls, minds empty of memory, smeared one into another... to this absolute dissolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_images_in_the_Soviet_Union">Caesar</a> damns his enemies... Not me! I will never let you take me! I will carve my memory into history, by work, by force, by guile, in swathes of blood and ashes if I must!<br/></i></blockquote><br/>I can admire Palmer's rendition of the old bad legacy code (it has driven quite a lot of history) but I admit it no part of a real morality. The dead are past caring.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/aura">Aura</a> (metaphysical identity) of art is used to devalue perfect replicas of the nuked Coliseum and Forum (which seems like magical thinking to me):<br/><blockquote><i>All false. Our race cannot afford such losses again... On the Acropolis the tears we shed are still tears of connection: where I stand Socrates stood. In the [replica] Roman Forum, by the [replica] Coliseum or the [replica] Patheon, they are regret tears. Replicas cannot touch. That is what we all want, to touch what someone touched, a special someone... whose story reached forward through history...<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Speak for yourself; a perfect simulacrum is enough, though it screams depth to say otherwise. (I'm not actually salty: I love the breadth of ideologies on show here. No doubt someone else will grumble about how thin and unconvincing the utilitarian views presented here are. By writing so many good characters in disagreement, Palmer has passed about <a href="https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html">10 Intellectual Turing Tests</a>. )<br/><br/>On the other hand, I feel the horror of true deontology quite keenly:<br/><blockquote><i>Dominic would happily watch the world burn if he could defile the blasphemer's corpse amid the coals.<br/> </i></blockquote><br/>Much as I like Jedd Mason, his rise to the top of every state - the expressionless, motionless, Spectrumy king of the world - is implausible, even given his mother's scheming; it only makes sense with Intervention. Which is fine, because Palmer is committed to that, but it would still have been nice to have a natural path.     <br/><br/>Many potential irritants. You'll have to be fine with long fourth-wall violations, long passages in macaronic Latin, hallucinated philosophers reacting to C25th scenes by expositing their extrapolated view of the 25th Century, allusions that yell 'REMEMBER ME??' in your face (Hobbestown, the anarchist commune). I found Mycroft's madness engaging but it does divert every chapter a bit. <br/><br/>The best so far, but you must read the first two. I donno, I'm just rambling now cos I know I'll rewrite this after I read it again in like one unripe year.<br/><br/><br><br/><hr /><br/><b>Misc notes</b><br/><br/>* Achilles is an actual hero here - where in the <i>Iliad</i> he is merely impressively violent. Actually as any fool knows, the ancient heroes are mostly morally small, beneath even us. ("Hero" meant "Big Man", not "saviour".) This is good news, that Achilles (and say Jahweh) are not paragons any more.<br/><br/>* Miracles happen; Bridger is magical through and through, not even needing a virgin birth. So there was no need for JEDD to be born of woman and Spain. Except that this allows him to be a stark example of Hegelian becoming, which here is the way that God speaks. (And what filth he says.)<br/><br/>* Next time you complain about how undemocratic your country is, consider: The Mitsubishi here are not only a planned plutocracy, they also have 4 orders of delegated authority: the voters elect representatives who elect representatives who elect representatives who elect the executive.<br/><br/>* Oh Mycroft. I spent the first book and a half wondering exactly why he is so indispensable, hounded, beloved. This mostly answers it: it's a mixture of macaronic language, dog charisma, and weird athleticism.<br/><br/>* Nice, surprising bit of anarchism: Hobbestown, the anarchist syndicate, is the 'safest' place in the world. OK, its because of the deterrent of capital punishment but still.<br/><br/>* A decent portrayal of <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/">the burgeoning far-future-focussed ethics</a>, in the otherworldly, post-political, arch-instrumentalist scientists, Utopia. Palmer clearly sympathises with them. One contradiction in her portrayal, though: the Utopians are monomanaical consequentialists, who'll do anything to prevent human extinction or stasis. But they're shown throwing massive resources at trivial uneconomic projects (trivial compared to WMD destruction, space colonization, and terraforming): an underwater city, a city on Antarctica, robots in the shape of mythical beasts. I suppose it's possible this is a PR thing, either to charm or recruit. <br/><br/>Their oath actually inspired moral guilt in me, which is hard to do:<br/><blockquote><i>I hereby renounce the right to complacency, and vow lifelong to take only what minimum of leisure is necessary to my productivity... I will commit the full produce of my labors to our collective effort to redirect the path of human life away from death and toward the stars.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>* Palmer knows about a lot of things: Hobbes, evolutionary history, the way a small boat makes waves. Her using this knowledge never felt contrived to me - but again I suspect this is a niche I happen to fall in.<br/><blockquote><i>The fittest survived, but with the conquered within them, as conquered bacteria became the mitochondria which feed the cells that crawl through volvox, trilobite, and coelacanth toward Mars.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>* It suits me that the psychoanalyst Hive choose to be the enemies of the future:<br/><blockquote><i>"War?" Utopia offered.<br/>[the Head Analyst] Felix Faust... accepted the handshake. "War." <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>* It's written with a future reader in mind, but then Mycroft explains too much; nothing is taken for granted, and this is obviously on our account, tainting the conceit. <br/><br/>* Its gender dynamics don't constitute a polemic; instead the Hives' failing utopia shows what most feminist / Critical / international relations theory misses. 'Xenofeminism' (tech-positive, bioprogressive feminism) is a more complete answer to gender harms. But, hearteningly, even mainstream figures <a href="http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Ethics_Aesthetics_and_Animals/Nussbaum_Beyond_Compassion_Part_3.htm">like Nussbaum</a> seem to be on board with similar projects: <br/><blockquote><i>this calls for the gradual formation of a world in which all species will enjoy cooperative and supportive relations with one another. Nature is not that way and has never been. So it calls for the gradual supplanting of the natural by the just.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>* <blockquote><i>A man may leap into the fray in the name of Liberty, Homeland, Human Rights, Justice, but never Economics.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>(more's the pity)<br/><br/>* <blockquote><i><br/>If my Saladin is childhood's fear, the unknowable evil in the closet's depths, I have become adulthood's fear, fear of power, law, illustrious contacts, police resources, covert agencies, and sweet judicial murder.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><spoiler><br/>* Mycroft's 'death' is immediately subverted by a footnote from him. But then the chapter plays out as if we hadn't seen that footnote, and so it loses most of its emotional charge. This is weird but obviously totally intentional. Twists the twist before the twist can begin. Not sure what's going on - maybe Palmer had tired of doing ordinary twists. (There are a lot of them.)<br/></spoiler></td>

Chapter Two argues the moral case for stopping this nastiness.

      <td><i>The Age of Em: Work, Love and Life When Robots Rule the Earth</i> (2016) by Robin Hanson</td>
      <td>Believe me that it's remarkable; it's easily in the top 5 most insightful books out of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/68316850-gavin-leech?shelf=read">the 500</a> I have reviewed here. I called <i>Superintelligence</i> the most rigorous exploration of the nonreal I had ever read: this beats it by a lot. You will find yourself reading pages on the properties of coolant pipes and be utterly engrossed. It is imaginary sociology, imaginary economics, <i>real</i> fiction. <br/><br/>(But it lacks an ethnography entirely: no em speaks to us themselves.)<br/><br/>People tend to wrap <i>Age of Em</i> in ulterior motives and esoteric intentions, because they love it but see futurism as an unworthy goal for such an achievement. I am no different: this is the greatest compendium of real social science I have ever found.<br/><br/>No review can do much justice, but here's one particularly hair-raising point in it: Hanson surveys the whole course of human history, and notes the many ways our culture is unprecedented and, in the evolutionary sense, nonadaptive:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>we live in the brief but important “dreamtime” when delusions [drive] history.  Our descendants will remember our era as the one where the human capacity to sincerely believe crazy non-adaptive things, and act on those beliefs, was dialed to the max.<br/><br/>Why is our era so delusory?<br/><br/>    <ol><br/><li>Our knowledge has been growing so fast, and bringing such radical changes, that many of us see anything as possible, so that nothing can really be labeled delusion.</li><br/><br/><li>    Rich folks like us have larger buffers of wealth to cushion our mistakes; we can live happily and long even while acting on crazy beliefs.</li><br/><br/><li>    We humans evolved to signal various features of ourselves to one another via delusions; we usually think that the various things we do to signal are done for other reasons.  For example, we think we pay for docs to help our loved ones get well, rather than to show that we care.  We think we do politics because we want to help our nation, rather than to signal our character and loyalty.  We are overconfident in our abilities in order to convince others to have confidence in us, and so on.  But while our ancestors’ delusions were well adapted to their situations, and so didn’t hurt them much, the same delusions are not nearly as adapted to our rapidly changing world; our signaling induced delusions hurt us more.</li><br/><br/><li>    Humans seem to have evolved to emphasize signaling more in good times than in bad.  Since very few physical investments last very long, the main investments one can make in good times that last until bad times are allies and reputation. So we are built to, in good times, spend more time and energy on leisure, medicine, charity, morals, patriotism, and so on.  Relative to our ancestors’ world, our whole era is one big very good time.</li><br/><br/><li>    Our minds were built with a near mode designed more for practical concrete reasoning about things up close, and a far mode designed more for presenting a good image to others via our abstract reasoning about things far away.  But our minds must now deal with a much larger world where many relevant things are much further away, and abstract reasoning is more useful.  So we rely more than did our ancestors on that abstract far mode capability.  But since that far mode was tuned more for presenting a good image, it is much more tolerant of good-looking delusions.</li><br/><br/><li>    Tech now enables more exposure to mood-altering drugs and arts, and specialists make them into especially potent “super-stimuli.”... today drugs are cheap, we can hear music all the time, most surfaces are covered by art, and we spend much of our day with stories from TV, video games, etc.  And all that art is made by organized groups of specialists far better than the typical ancestral artist.</li><br/><br/><li>    We were built to be influenced by the rhetoric, eloquence, difficulty, drama, and repetition of arguments, not just their logic.  Perhaps this once helped us to ally us with high status folks.  And we were built to show our ideals via the stories we like, and also to like well-crafted stories.  But today we are exposed to arguments and stories by folks far more expert than found in ancestral tribes.  Since we are built to be quite awed and persuaded by such displays, our beliefs and ideals are highly influenced by our writers and story-tellers.  And these folks in turn tell us what we want to hear, or what their patrons want us to hear, neither of which need have much to do with reality.<br/></li></ol><br/><br/>These factors combine to make our era the most consistently and consequentially deluded and unadaptive of any era ever.  When they remember us, our distant descendants will be shake their heads at the demographic transition, where we each took far less than full advantage of the reproductive opportunities our wealth offered.  They will note how we instead spent our wealth to buy products we saw in ads that talked mostly about the sort of folks who buy them.  They will lament our obsession with super-stimuli that highjacked our evolved heuristics to give us taste without nutrition.   They will note we spent vast sums on things that didn’t actually help on the margin, such as on medicine that didn’t make us healthier, or education that didn’t make us more productive.<br/><br/>Our descendants will also remember our adolescent and extreme mating patterns, our extreme gender personalities, and our unprecedentedly fierce warriors.  They will be amazed at the strange religious, political, and social beliefs we acted on, and how we preferred a political system, democracy, designed to emphasize the hardly-considered fleeting delusory thoughts of the median voter rather than the considered opinions of our best experts.<br/><br/>Perhaps most important, our descendants may remember how history hung by a precarious thread on a few crucial coordination choices that our highly integrated rapidly changing world did or might have allowed us to achieve, and the strange delusions that influenced such choices.  These choices might have been about global warming, rampaging robots, nuclear weapons, bioterror, etc.  Our delusions may have led us to do something quite wonderful, or quite horrible, that permanently changed the options available to our descendants.  This would be the most lasting legacy of this, our explosively growing dream time, when what was once adaptive behavior with mostly harmless delusions become strange and dreamy unadaptive behavior, before adaptation again reasserted a clear-headed relation between behavior and reality.<br/><br/>Our dreamtime will be a time of legend, a favorite setting for grand fiction, when low-delusion heroes and the strange rich clowns around them could most plausibly have changed the course of history.  Perhaps most dramatic will be tragedies about dreamtime advocates who could foresee and were horrified by the coming slow stable adaptive eons, and tried passionately, but unsuccessfully, to prevent them.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>It's easy to read a radical critique of our liberal values in there, but I believe him when he says that he doesn't dislike dreamtime; he just predicts it cannot last, because we are fighting an old and inexorable tide.<br/><br/>There are several thoughts this large, and a thousand other small insights in <i>Age of Em</i>.</td>

Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. <br/><blockquote><i>A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Rosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic"><i>dramatic</i></a> worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. <br/><br/>People seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)<br/><blockquote><i>Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/topics/four-income-levels/">Level 4</a> [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. <br/><br/>When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>On the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:<br/><blockquote><i>In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...<br/><br/>With my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent <br/>suffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United <br/>States, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. <br/>Thousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months <br/>when the evidence was already available. <br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Bad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:<br/><blockquote><i>There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Relentlessly sensible:<br/><blockquote><i>resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>I've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.<br/><blockquote><i>Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have. <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>One of the "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/68316850?shelf=worldview-in-five-books">five books that represent my worldview</a>": moral passion, strict empiricism, psychological depth, existential hope.

But that said, there's a "charity is not about helping" bit:<br/><blockquote><i>If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>But despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:<br/><blockquote><i>Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. <br/><br/>When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>This, then, is the same message as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World?ac=1&from_search=true">Sagan</a>, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>Misc notes</b><br/><br/>- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against "developed" / "developing" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.<br/><br/>- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.<br/><blockquote><i>I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from <br/>university if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>- "<i>I do not believe that fake news is the major culprit for our distorted worldview: we haven’t only just started to get the world wrong, I think we have always gotten it wrong.</i>"<br/><br/>- "<i>In the car industry, cars are recalled when a mistake is discovered. You get a letter from the manufacturer saying, “We would like to recall your vehicle and replace the brakes.” When the facts about the world that you were taught in schools and universities become out of date, you should get a letter too: “Sorry, what we taught you is no longer true.

      <td>The most vibrant presentation of sceptical empiricism since Dawkins stopped being beautiful.<br/><br/><i>Black Swan</i> is a furious pompous attack on macroeconomics, journalism, and risk modelling via heuristics and biases; so it is an amazing introduction to modelling. But it's also an entire original worldview, applying to history, policy, science, and personal conduct. This is taken even further (too far?) in <i>Antifragile</i>, which is more or less a work of evolutionary epistemology, or evolutionary practical ethics. There's a lot of redundancy between them; Fooled by Randomness gives you the highest signal:rant ratio.<br/><br/>The first three books are largely critical, hacking away at theory-blindness, model error, and the many kinds of people he sees as possessing unearned status (economists, journalists, consultants, business-book writers): this is the upswing, a chaotic attempt to give general positive advice in a world that dooms general positive advice.<br/><br/>Every other page has something worth hearing, for its iconoclasm, or a Latin gobbet, or catty anecdote, if not something globally and evidently true. I think he is right about 30% of the time, which is among the highest credences I have for anyone. I only think I am 35% right, for instance. But a core point is that he thinks his approach should work even given our intractable ignorance.<br/><br/>The core point, repeated a hundred times for various domains: In real life, many systems deteriorate without an irregular supply of stressors (non-fatal negative events), and actually benefit from them by constructively overreacting. By robbing such 'antifragile' systems of stressors, modern approaches to managing them do damage in the guise of helping out. <br/><br/>Taleb was my introduction to the post-classical theory of reason, but the project overlaps a bit with the LessWrong school I now favour. Underneath (i.e. in the technical appendices), his approach is very similar but with more conservative goals. I think Taleb saved me years of synthesis and conceptual invention.<br/><br/>His conduct on Twitter (ridiculous chest-beating, insulting anyone who disagrees with him, including great scholars like Tetlock and Thaler) is embarrassing, but does not detract from the accomplishment.<br/><br/><i>    In one sentence</i>: Extraordinarily rude man marries classical ethics to modern mathematics and cognitive science.<br/><br/><i>    To be read when</i>: young; if you have a news habit; when despairing of university economics.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>    <a href="https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/">Galef type</a>: <br><br/>Data 3 - highlights patterns in the world <br/>    & Theory 1&2&3&4&5 - a general concept or lens you can use to analyze many different things, &<br/>    Style 1 - teaches principles of thinking directly.<br/><br/></li><br/></ul></td>

The Devil once lived in Heaven, and those who have not met him are unlikely to recognize an angel when they see one...

      <td>Addictive horrible hilarious biographies of British folly, banality and sin. A thousand years of tabloid gossip and popular madness, events too ephemeral for most serious historians: degradation, unchecked insanity and petty cruelty. But incredibly funny.

Obviously this is no demerit in an unsystematic historian. The modern gang biographies attest to his personal acquaintance with the big diamond geezers (which makes him a "silly bollocks", a foolish gang dilettante). His wit's mostly very dry, on occasion boiling over into outrage:<br/><blockquote><i>Dodd's execution took place at Tyburn on 27 June 1777 and the outcry it occasioned has  been recognized by some historians as a key moment in focusing public attention on the brutality of capital punishment. It seems more likely, however, that it was caused less by any  broad change in public opinion than by the fact Dodd was of the same class as those protesting his execution. A 15-year-old orphan, John Harris, hanged on the same day for  stealing two and half guineas, received no such support, least of all from Dr Johnson...<br/><br/>Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the law was changed to ensure that the production and supply of dangerous drugs should henceforth be in the hands of criminal organisations. Some people have argued that this is not an ideal arrangement.</i></blockquote><br/>I made the mistake of trying to read it over one week - so the endless succession of 18th century rapist officers being instantly pardoned and/or their victims being arrested kind of ran together. It is actually the best bog book ever and wants 4 slow months. I understand Britain a lot better now. The author would <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/25/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries">emphatically deserve</a> an entry of his own in any future edition: astonishing wit, astonishing connections, astonishing potential, with little to show for it but a barrel of laughs and this.</td>

(And contempt is a kind of involuntary respect.) Backwards analogy: Bukowski is Tom Waits minus gospel, minus FX pedals, minus Brecht and Weill, minus one steady Kathleen peer. And minus metre of course. A grumpy adolescent old man; a sensitising misanthrope; a beautiful lech.<br/><br/>He has only two modes: midnight countercultural raving and laconic woke-at-noon observation. Neither would work without his lecherousness and/or meanness and/or arrogance; they are the absolutely necessary breve before he blares out his concern.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>    moments of agony and moments of glory<br/>    march across my roof.<br/><br/>    the cat walks by<br/>    seeming to know everything.<br/><br/>    my luck has been better, I think,<br/>    than the luck of the cut gladiolus,<br/>    although I am not sure.<br/><br/>    I have been loved by many women,<br/>    and for a hunchback of life,<br/>    that’s lucky.<br/><br/>    so many fingers pushing through my hair<br/>    so many arms holding me close<br/>    so many shoes thrown carelessly on my bedroom<br/>    rug.<br/><br/>    so many searching hearts<br/>    now fixed in my memory that<br/>    i’ll go to my death,<br/>    remembering.<br/>    I have been treated better than I should have<br/>    been—<br/>    not by life in general<br/>    nor by the machinery of things<br/>    but by women.<br/><br/>    but there have been other women<br/>    who have left me<br/>    standing in the bedroom alone<br/>    doubled over—<br/>    hands holding the gut—<br/>    thinking<br/>    why why why why why why?<br/><br/>    women go to men who are pigs<br/>    women go to men with dead souls<br/>    women go to men who fuck badly<br/>    women go to shadows of men<br/>    women go<br/>    go<br/>    because they must go<br/>    in the order of<br/>    things.<br/><br/>    the women know better<br/>    but often chose out of<br/>    disorder and confusion.<br/><br/>    they can heal with their touch<br/>    they can kill what they touch and<br/>    I am dying<br/>    but not dead<br/>    yet.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>(That ^ might have gotten your back up, because it pattern-matches to modern whining about women's choices. But it isn't that: remember, from above, that he is calling himself a pig and a dead soul.)<br/><br/>This is three books written over thirty years, one sentence per ten lines as always, stapled together to give the impression of a late-life opus. It covers the whole lot: his Great Depression origin myth; his meaningless, crabbed middle years; and his long, long late period spent in contempt of the arty people who pay and applaud him.<br/><br/>I am nothing like him, except maybe in sense of humour. He is not anti-modern - grew up through the Great Depression, a simulation of pre-modern subsistence; loves shit cars; lives for late night recorded music - but science, growth, and the expanding circle give him nothing of the sense of direction, transcendence and hope that it gives to me and mine. But still I "relate", as the disgusting verb puts it.<br/><br/>I have read this a half-dozen times in a dozen years. (It isn't hard; it takes an hour.) I know of no better poet to <i>begin</i> to explain why poetry is good and unique and feeds life. This surely says something about my character, but I don't expect to stop reading it.<br/><br/><br> <br/>PS: Bukowski's epitaph is "<i>Don't try</i>". On the face of it that's mean and funny and fine, but it also means what Yoda means by it: Don't force it; Don't betray your nature; Do only what you are absolutely aligned behind. Is that good advice? Maybe not, but it is epitomises the man more than the nihilistic joke.<br/><br/><ul><li>    <a href="https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/">Galef type</a>:<br><br/><i>Values 3</i> - written from a holistic value structure, letting you experience that value structure from the inside.<br/></li></td>

      <td><i>Blindsight (Firefall, #1)</i> (2006) by Peter Watts</td>
      <td>There is a horror in neuroscience. It isn't inherent: it depends on subverting your sentimental sense of self, meaning, will, introspection, spirituality; if you don't have these, it won't register. The horror takes unthreatening academic names like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia">agnosia</a>", "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bereitschaftspotential#BP_and_free_will">readiness potential</a>", "<a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-7/neuroscience-soul">interhemispheric intrusion</a>", "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_religion">neurotheology</a>", "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_memory">reconstructive memory</a>", "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room#Replies">Chinese room</a>". (Also "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy_in_the_workplace">executive psychopath</a>" though.) <br/>  <br/>The <i>Blindsight</i> ethos - Gothic, fatalist, Darwinist, one of the grandest pessimisms I've ever seen - is what you get when you take a traditional worldview (dualism, free will, work as what dignifies life, human exceptionalism, further-fact identity) and slam the great disenchanting science of a hundred years into it. And then add the coming century's automation and self-modification.<br/><br/>    <i>Blindsight</i> put me in a funk for a week - even though I don't hold any of the positions it sinks. I suppose this is evidence of Watt's talent. ("<i>Art is a nonrational tool for persuasion: beware.</i>") Not the least of its achievements is maintaining its murky nihilism in a world where <i>friendly superintelligences exist</i>.<br/><br/>    Because of its actual knowledge, this is weird realism, well beyond Lovecraft's. <i>They're coming out of the walls: they're coming out of our best science</i>. The vampires (and, to an extent, the Jovian von Neumann spikefest the plot is about) detract from this deeper horror a bit. Doom; unfixable aberration; people who have warped themselves. If you find <i>Black Mirror</i> a bit too disturbing you might want to give this a miss. Watts even tackles "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminative_materialism">illusionism</a>" - uniquely I think!<br/><br/>    Is it strange that the giant lessons of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution">cognitive revolution</a> are still rare in fiction? The only explanations I can think of are: simply "the Two Cultures" (i.e. novelists are ignorant); or, more discreditable, that novelists are shilling for traditional philosophy, maybe because it sells. (#1 giant lesson: <i>we do not have introspective access to <b>most</b> of what our brains or minds do</i>, on the level of information processing, action, motivation, or even <a href="http://www.cns.nyu.edu/ledoux/pdf/rethinkingEM.pdf">emotion</a>. You might say Freud found this out - but he didn't use reliable methods, made huge obvious errors, and created a closed unfalsifiable loop and so did not really have knowledge.)<br/><br/> In contrast, Watts knows a great deal, uses it well, and takes seriously what he knows: for instance, readiness potentials are given all the emotional weight they deserve. This novel has 100 scientific papers listed in the back. The only people who cram quite as many ideas into their books as Watts are Stephenson and Banks.<br/><br/>His scorn for the fumbling entendres of psychoanalysis is also extremely endearing:<br/><blockquote><i>According to the experts of that time, multiple personalities arose spontaneously from unimaginable cauldrons of abuse — fragmentary personae offered up to suffer rapes and beatings while the child behind took to some unknowable sanctuary in the folds of the brain. It was both survival strategy and ritual self-sacrifice: powerless souls hacking themselves to pieces, offering up quivering chunks of self in the desperate hope that the vengeful gods called Mom or Dad might not be insatiable.<br/><br/>None of it had been real, as it turned out. Or at least, none of it had been confirmed. The experts of the day had been little more than witch doctors dancing through improvised rituals: meandering free-form interviews full of leading questions and nonverbal cues, scavenger hunts through regurgitated childhoods. Sometimes a shot of lithium or haloperidol when the beads and rattles didn't work. The technology to map minds was barely off the ground; the technology to edit them was years away. So the therapists and psychiatrists poked at their victims and invented names for things they didn't understand, and argued over the shrines of Freud and Klein and the old Astrologers. Doing their very best to sound like practitioners of Science. </i></blockquote><br/><br><blockquote><i>"So we're fishing for what, exactly? Repressed memories?" <br/>"No such thing." She grinned in toothy reassurance. "There are only memories we choose to ignore, or kinda think around, if you  know what I mean." </i></blockquote><br/>People diss the prose but I think it fits the ethos incredibly well:<br/><blockquote><i>We fled like frightened children with brave faces. We left a base camp behind: Jack, still miraculously functional in its vestibule; a tunnel into the haunted mansion; forlorn magnetometers left to die in the faint hope they might not. Crude pyronometers and thermographs, antique radiation-proof devices that measured the world through the flex and stretch of metal tabs and etched their findings on rolls of plastic. Glow-globes and diving bells and guide ropes strung one to another... <br/><br/>Inside each of us, infinitesimal lacerations were turning our cells to mush. Plasma membranes sprang countless leaks. Overwhelmed repair enzymes clung desperately to shredded genes and barely delayed the inevitable. Anxious to avoid the rush, patches of my intestinal lining began flaking away before the rest of the body had a chance to die. </i></blockquote><br/>    Siri, the sociopath pinhead, is a great character. But also often an infuriating <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan">Hollywood Rationalist</a>, and several times he gets the last word which forces me to suspect Watts of it. Though the bit where his girlfriend is dying and he refuses to say anything because it would be cliched is clearly intentionally infuriating for the reader. So might be this stupid bit of game theory:<br/><blockquote><i>"Well, according to game theory, you should never tell anyone when your birthday is."<br/>"I don't follow." <br/>"It's a lose-lose proposition. There's no winning strategy." <br/>"What do you mean, strategy? It's a birthday." <br/><br/>Look, I'd said, say you tell everyone when it is and nothing happens. It's kind of a slap in the face.<br/>Or suppose they throw you a party, Chelsea had replied. <br/>Then you don't know whether they're doing it sincerely, or if your earlier interaction just guilted them into observing an occasion they'd rather have ignored. But if you don't tell anyone, and nobody commemorates the event, there's no reason to feel badly because after all, nobody knew. And if someone does buy you a drink then you know it's sincere because nobody would go to all the trouble of finding out when your birthday is — and then celebrating it — if they didn't honestly like you. <br/><br/>...I could just... plot out the payoff matrix, Tell/Don't Tell along the columns, Celebrated/Not Celebrated along the rows, the unassailable black-and-white logic of cost and benefit in the squares themselves. The math was irrefutable: the one winning strategy was concealment. Only fools revealed their birthdays.</i></blockquote><br/>- this only follows if you have <i>ridiculously</i> strong error aversion, where the value of being certain about others' opinion of you overrules the pleasantness of ordinary interaction.<br/><br/>    He mentions (but then averts) the single most annoying error when talking about consciousness, which is that "maybe it's better for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">p-zombie</a> aliens to take over, since they are clearly fitter than us":<br/><blockquote><i>"It doesn't bug you?" Sascha was saying. "Thinking that your mind, the very thing that makes you you, is nothing but some kind of parasite?"<br/>"Forget about minds," he told her. "Say you've got a device designed to monitor — oh, cosmic rays, say. What happens when you turn its sensor around so it's not pointing at the sky anymore, <br/>but at its own guts?" He answered himself before she could: "It does what it's built to. It measures cosmic rays, even though it's not looking at them any more. It parses its own circuitry in terms of cosmic-ray metaphors, because those feel right, because they feel natural, because it can't look at things any other way. But it's the wrong metaphor. So the system misunderstands everything about itself. Maybe that's not a grand and glorious evolutionary leap after all. Maybe it's just a design flaw." </i></blockquote><br/>(Who cares about fitness? A world without qualia is 'Disneyland without children'.)<br/><br/>His Mathesonian attempt to naturalise vampires is <i>kinda</i> clever (they are a subspecies of cannibal savants), and the exemplar vamp Jukka is one of the best characters in the book - but overall their presence is distracting and off-piste; the right-angles epilepsy thing, the revived-by-corporate-greed schtick, more generally holding that corporate culture is putting macroscopic selection pressure to psychopathic nonsentience: all these things jolt me out of his otherwise well-built world.<br/><br/>    Besides the vampires, there are a few more over-the-top ughs. His whole theme of technology as inherently dehumanising, <i>Black Mirror / Event Horizon</i> is just as cherry-picked and annoying as it always is.     The idea that consciousness is unadaptive, and so a one-off aberration in a universe of blind replicators - which steamrolls all objections in the novel - is not obviously true. But it is certainly true either way that our society is currently unadaptive, in the sense of not maximising reproduction. (And thank god for that.)<br/><br/>Wrenching but admirable.

However, I feel just the same about the people in illustrations I dream up, about the characters I see in novels or the dramatis personae on the stage who speak through the actors representing them.<br/><br/>I suppose no one truly admits the existence of another person. One might concede that the other person is alive and feels and thinks like oneself, but there will always be an element of difference, a perceptible discrepancy, that one cannot quite put one's finger on. There are figures from times past, fantasy-images in books that seem more real to us than these specimens of indifference-made-flesh who speak to us across the counters of bars, or catch our eye in trams, or brush past us in the empty randomness of the streets. The others are just part of the landscape for us, usually the invisible landscape of the familiar.<br/><br/>I feel closer ties and more intimate bonds with certain characters in books, with certain images I've seen in engravings, that with many supposedly real people, with that metaphysical absurdity known as 'flesh and blood'. In fact 'flesh and blood' describes them very well: they resemble cuts of meat laid on the butcher's marble slab, dead creatures bleeding as though still alive, the sirloin steaks and cutlets of Fate.<br/><br/>I'm not ashamed to feel this way because I know it's how everyone feels. The lack of respect between men, the indifference that allows them to kill others without compunction (as murderers do) or without thinking (as soldiers do), comes from the fact that no one pays due attention to the apparently abstruse idea that other people have souls too.<br/></i></blockquote></td>

      <td><i>The Patrick Melrose Novels</i> (2012) by Edward St. Aubyn</td>
      <td>Marvelous. Even though: nearly filled-up with resentment and self-pity. Patrick's staggering detachment from and humour about his own inner life makes the books rise far above him - most of the series is not spent in Patrick's head but instead depicts his brutal gilded circle - and, every few pages, there is a moment of beautiful lucidity or unvoiced empathy. The prose, the humour, the sadness are enough to make you glad, with Patrick, that his parents are dead.<br/><br/>The prose is wonderfully smooth, but I took my time, jolted out every few pages by something demanding reflection: "Evil is sickness celebrating itself";<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>    Just as a novelist may sometimes wonder why he invents characters who do not exist and makes them do things which do not matter, so a philosopher may wonder why he invents cases that cannot occur in order to determine what must be the case. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Underneath the filth and irony, Patrick is someone for whom philosophical questions are natural and urgent. The long discursions are more motivated and seamless than in any novel I can think of.<br/><br/>At one point, Mary dismisses the idea that her son's anxiety and angst, so like his father's, could have a genetic component - and assumes that it has inadvertently leaked out of Patrick's behaviour. (She goes on to leave him, actually making a damage-control argument about removing the children from his helpless influence.)<br/><br/>Yes: For all his insight, wit, cynicism, contrarianism, St Aubyn is still stuck in a giant contemporary ideology: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurture_Assumption">nurture assumption</a>, the culture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_genetics#Genetic_influences_on_behaviour_are_pervasive">environment-only development</a> and essential woundedness.<br/><br/>Sure, people get wounded all the time, and being able to say so in public is a great gain, (for one thing, no one in a confessional culture has to assume that they are alone, that their defects are bizarrely theirs. But if trauma is the centre of some people's sense of self - if it is fetishised and even incentivised (e.g. misery memoirs and high-clap Medium posts)... The risks of centring such things are large and underreported: self-fulfilling prophecies, agonising rumination, and the loss of the peace and pleasure of gratitude.<br/><br/>Fine, Aubyn is correct about our sad path-dependence - he's just too recent in placing the start of the path. <a href="www.wfsbp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Treatment_Guidelines/Biological_markers_for_anxiety_disorders_OCD_and_PTSD_a_consensus_statement_Part_I_Neuroimaging_and_genetics.pdf">Here are genetic markers</a> for anxiety and PTSD, against the novel's tacit, almost Freudian emphasis on environment alone.<br/><br/>Aubyn is obviously somewhat detached from his own trauma - you can't write prose this fair and glowing if you're not - which is lucky. Otherwise, the seeker after truth would be senselessly telling the vulnerable they're deluded about their own life. (As we all are, though not in the same ways.)<br/><br/><br/>*<br/>Serious engagement with philosophy of mind throughout:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>    In any case, he now felt in danger all the time. Danger of liver collapse, marital breakdown, terminal fear. Nobody ever died of a feeling, he would say to himself, not believing a word of it, as he sweated his way through the feeling that he was dying of fear. People died of feelings all the time, once they had gone through the formality of materializing them into bullets and bottles and tumours. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>More generally, Patrick actually wrestles with materialism, rather than using the usual literary tricks of caricature and omission on it.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>Curious whether St Aubyn got his vicious rendition of Princess Margaret at <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n01/ferdinand-mount/always-the-same-dream">first- or second-hand</a>.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>The first three chapters of Mother's Milk, told from the perspective of Patrick's first child, are just perfect writing. Robert sees only the benevolence and humour of his parents, not their exhaustion, rage, and bad faith. They are anonymous to him and us, just Robert's mother and Robert's father. It is a glory and a high echelon, though it gives giving the emotional arc of the rest of the book a very long way to fall.<br/><blockquote><br/>    Thomas [2 years old] still knew how to understand the silent language which Robert had almost lost as the wild margins of his mind fell under the sway of a verbal empire. He was standing on a ridge, about to surge downhill, getting faster, getting taller, getting more words, getting bigger and bigger explanations, cheering all the way. Now Thomas had made him glance backwards and lower his sword for a moment while he noticed everything he had lost as well. He had become so caught up in building sentences that he had almost forgotten the barbaric days when thinking was like a splash of colour on a page. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The exaggeration of the wisdom of children is even stronger in Mother's Milk. This is no criticism because St Aubyn isn't very committed to realism, and because Robert's rich and sparkling inner life suits one of the themes: that children deserve to be treated well, taken relatively seriously, as we all do. And that purpose is not the same as result ('telos' indeed):<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>    We think the purpose of a child is to grow up because it does grow up. But its purpose is to play, to enjoy itself, to be a child. If we merely look to the end of the process, the purpose of life is death. <br/></blockquote><br/>The art of kintsugi.</td>

And that’s a living death, a non-human void (“I never feel so private as when I know [Bartleby is] here”). <br/><blockquote> <i>So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but, in certain special cases, beyond that point it does not. They err who would assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness of the human heart. It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of remedying excessive and organic ill. To a sensitive being, pity is not seldom pain. And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul be rid of it.</i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>That copyists are an extinct breed only adds to the seething flavour; it is <i>possible</i> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a> and distributed Captchas could have minimised Bartleby’s suffering - that the condition the piece wrangles with isn’t eternal.

      <td><br/>The best synthesis of the study of human nature (cognitive psychology, interactionist sociology, primatology, and economics) I've ever seen. Freud done right ("although the explanations in this book may seem Freudian at times, we follow mainstream cognitive psychology in rejecting most of Freud's methods and many of his conclusions"). It's introductory, laced with illustrative anecdotes but with much deeper scholarship underneath.<br/><br/>The 'elephant in the brain' is our unwitting selfishness. We compete without knowing or admitting it, for we are social animals seeking power or status, and thereby sex.<br/><blockquote><br/>    Modeling the world accurately isn't the be-all and end-all of the human brain. Brains evolved to help our bodies, and ultimately our genes, get along and get ahead in the world—a world that includes not just rocks and squirrels and hurricanes, but also other human beings. And if we spend a significant fraction of our lives interacting with others (which we do), trying to convince them of certain things (which we do), why shouldn't our brains adopt socially useful beliefs as first-class citizens, alongside world-modeling beliefs? Wear a mask long enough and it becomes your face. Play a role long enough and it becomes who you are. Spend enough time pretending something is true and you might as well believe it.<br/><br/>    Incidentally, this is why politicians make a great case study for self-deception. The social pressure on their beliefs is enormous. Psychologically, then, politicians don't so much 'lie' as regurgitate their own self-deceptions. Both are ways of misleading others, but self-deceptions are a lot harder to catch and prosecute. <br/></blockquote><br/>Simler undertook the book in lieu of a PhD, and his work is a welcome modification of Hanson's usual relentlessly lucid style: he is more concrete, chattier, more personable.<br/><blockquote><br/>    Information is sensitive in part because it can threaten our self-image and therefore our social image. So the rest of the brain conspires—whispers—to keep such information from becoming too prominent, especially in consciousness. In this sense, the Freuds were right: the conscious ego needs to be protected. But not because we are fragile, but rather to keep damaging information from leaking out of our brain and into the minds of our associates. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>You can probably skip this if you're familiar with Overcoming Bias / LessWrong / Econlog - but even then it's a pleasant read.

Place them in enormous, indifferent vistas; give us no inner monologue - nor even indirect report of subjective life; have no speech marks to set their words apart from the landscapes (do not draw the eye to their presumed humanity); have no apostrophes, no hyphens even, lest we remember; have as few names as possible, leave them as types - "kid" or "captain" or "mexican" or "brave"; set their incredible violence among such vast places it looks like little; have few capital letters but for God's.<br/><br/>Lock your readers out; make everyone and everything opaque. As he says himself:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    In the neuter austerity of that terrain all phenomena were bequeathed a strange equality and no one thing nor spider nor stone nor blade of grass could put forth claim to precedence.</i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>These cowboys and injuns punctuate the beautiful land of Central America with hanged babies; rings of decapitate heads; a four-eyed dog; a man calmly eating his own shit; endless thirsty hallucinogenic despair. This is exhausting, quite hard to read:<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>    All night the wind blew and the fine dust set their teeth on edge. Sand in everything, grit in all they ate. In the morning a urinecolored sun rose blearily through panes of dust on a dim world and without feature. The animals were failing... That night they rode through a region electric and wild where strange shapes of soft blue fire ran over the metal of the horses' trappings and the wagonwheels rolled in hoops of fire and little shapes of pale blue light came to perch in the ears of the horses and in the beards of the men... the mountains on the sudden skyline stark and black and livid like a land of some other order out there whose true geology was not stone but fear.</i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(As well as this Nabokovian trudge through the middle section, McCarthy sometimes steers close to the comical with sentences like '<i>Itinerant degenerates bleeding west like a heliotropic plague.</i>')<br/><br/>A typical human interaction in this book is "The kid looked at the man"; no more. There's plenty of grandeur - just not in humans. <br/><br/>At the centre stands the Judge: Satan, Ahab and Moby Dick all in one. ("<i>His skin is so pale as to have almost no pigment</i>.") Racism, fear and poverty form the baseline. The Comanches, for instance, are here worse than demons <br/><blockquote><i><br/>    ...grotesque with daubings like a company of mounted clowns... riding down upon them like a horde from a hell more horrible yet than the brimstone land of Christian reckoning...</i><br/></blockquote>- "at least demons are Christian"!<br/><br/>Lots of descriptions of the stars, inbetween brutalities<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    The night sky lies so sprent with stars that there is scarcely a space of black at all and they fall all night in bitter arcs and it is so that their numbers are no less...<br><br><br/>    The stars burned with a lidless fixity and they drew nearer in the night until toward dawn he was stumbling among the whinstones of the uttermost ridge to heaven.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>For the first time I understand why Aristotle's physics divides the world into different celestial and terranean operations: from down here back then, the stars look so clean and permanent, they're just not of our world, dirty, unhinged, and endangered as it has been, for almost everyone.<br/><br/><li><br/><i><a href="https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/">Galef type</a></i>: <br/><b>Data 2</b> - What does it imply about the world, that X could happen?, & <br/><b>Style 3</b> - tickle your aesthetic sense in a way that obliquely makes you a more interesting, generative thinker.</li></td>

      <td>I've been playing at knowing China for years, but of course I do not. (For instance, I picked this calm, modest book up unwittingly, and learn it is the gold standard translation by the greatest Western sinologist of the day.) It's a great hook: supposedly, Chinese poetry (world poetry?) peaked in the Ninth Century. For almost their whole history, passion and violence were considered inappropriate topics for poetry! They resented melodrama and fantasy in their poets! I must be jaded to think this is great. <br/><br/>The poets seem all to be old men trying not to care about death - "snail shell men", in Ancient Chinese. They are mainly ultra-concrete - lots of masterpieces about <a href="http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/extracts-from-south-mountains-by-han-yu.html">mountains</a> and rice and fish. Graham is a droll, masterful guide, making the requisite comparisons to Baudelaire and Pound for me, the clunking reader. (I can only assume the strange meters he uses are good approximations to the original.) The war between Confucianism and Buddhism is prominent here, and is hard for me to imagine -probably because I have a Hollywood understanding of these two "serene" "coping" philosophies. Li Shangyin's (李商隐的) "On a Monastery Wall":  <br/><blockquote> <i>They rejected life to seek the way. Their footprints are before us. <br/> They offered up their brains, ripped up their bodies: so firm was their resolution. <br/> See it as large, and a millet grain cheats us of the universe: <br/> See it as small, and the world can hide in a pinpoint. <br/> The oyster before its womb fills thinks of the new cassia: <br/> The amber, when it first sets, remembers a former pine. <br/> If we trust the true and sure words written on Indian leaves <br/> We hear all past and future in one stroke of the temple bell</i>.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/> Like a typical Westerner, I like the weirdoes: <a href="http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/an-arrowhead-from-ancient-battlefield.html">Li He</a> (李賀), who's their wild fantasist (Blake?) and Meng Jiao (孟郊), barren kin of Poe.

      <td><blockquote><i>Laplace [the set engineer] is talking about levelling the slope to a mere 45 percent grade; but that would look like the narrow strip of land that forms an isthmus. I told him I would not allow that, because we would lose the central metaphor of the film. ‘Metaphor for what?’ he asked. I said I did not know, just that it was a grand metaphor. Maybe, I said, it was an image slumbering in all of us, and I happened to be the one to introduce him to a brother he had never met… <br/>he said he could not go working under these conditions, and wanted to leave.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>I have a weird relationship with Herzog. His films’ typical tone and message (Nietzschean tragicomedy) doesn't really appeal to me. I watch them – and I watch them all, even since <i><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dinotasia/#contentReviews">Dinotasia</a></i> – for their literal and figurative voice: his relentless, Teutonic ecstatic absurdity. I wait for that voice to roll out and make me hurt or laugh. <br/><br/>(Since his humour is only sometimes on show, I am often laughing at him – and yet, out of mawkish brutalism, through my irony, rise the most affecting scenes I’ve ever seen: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdOmH1SgZsc ">beach shot</a> in Cobra Verde; the clouds in Heart of Glass; the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWH_9VRWn8Y">wandering penguin </a>in Encounters; above all the <a href="https://youtu.be/PLnDyVJzU38?t=12m20s ">final shot</a> of My Best Fiend.)<br/><br/>These diaries show him to be more thoughtful, rational, contrived and poetic than I had guessed. His sincere interest in the locals’ territorial plight, his physical participation in the set construction and management, his absorption in the suffering of jungle animals, his incongruous bright-eyed interest in mathematics, his astonishing codependency with Kinski, are all deeply disarming. The prose takes some getting used to, since the plain unflinching goth awe of it is the kind of thing we are primed to mock. <br/><blockquote><i>The jungle is obscene. Everything about it is sinful, for which reason the sin does not stand out as sin. The voices in the jungle are silent; nothing is stirring, and a languid, immobile anger hovers over everything.</i></blockquote><br/>It is worth acclimating to: each entry is both bleak and hilarious, and Krishna Winston's translation is a thing of wonder, no doubt improving on WH. <br/><blockquote><i>I recall experiencing a similar shiver of awe as a child in Sachrang, when I found a fried piece of bright blue plastic that had floated down the brook and got caught on an over hanging branch. At the time, I had never seen anything like it, and I kept it hidden for weeks, licked it, found it slightly stretchy, full of miraculous properties. Not until weeks later, when I had my fill of owning it, did I show it to anyone. Till and I discovered when you held a burning match to it, it melted; it gave black smoke and a nasty smell, but it was something we had never seen before, an emissary from a distant world high in the mountains, along the upper reaches of the brook, where it vanished into gorges and there were no people. So where did it come from? Had it blown into the mountains by the wind? Idid not know, but I gave the plastic a name-what I do not recall. I do know it had a nice sound, and was very secret, and since then I have often racked my brains, trying to remember that name, that word. I would give a lot to know it, but I do not, and I also do not have that delicate piece of weather-beaten plastic anymore. Having neither the secret word nor the plastic makes me poorer today than I was as a child.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>He certainly views the natural world right: as overwhelmingly a place of horrifying and pointless suffering, cooed over by pseuds from cars. <br/><blockquote><i>Sweat, storm clouds overhead, sleeping dogs. There is a smell of stale urine. In my soup, ants and bugs were swimming among the globules of fat. Lord Almighty, send us an earthquake.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>There’s not a lot of technical info here, or explanations of the crew’s role or background; there's no timeline or context added; nor even very much about the film at all. But who cares? This is incredible as nature writing, dream journal, and logistical poetry.<br/></td>

      <td><i>Cultural Amnesia: Necessary Memories from History and the Arts</i> (2007) by Clive James</td>
      <td>I love James because, though he is a literary intellectual through and through, he makes room for the other half of the human mind. He <i>is</i> still an arts supremacist - this personal portrait of the century contains no scientists, and many actors and novelists and politicians, but he is at least aware of the narrowness of this.<br/><br/><i>Cultural Amnesia</i> is an invitation to the humanities; defence of philosophy and art against politics; an attack on the hypocrisy of the left (Kollontai, Sartre, Brecht, Saramago), on the heartlessness of the right (Junger, Brasillach, Pound, Heidegger); a dark, teeming biography of C20th humanism and its enemies; a reading list for all of us bewildered by the bullshit critical fortresses of serious writing about art and history. James is deeply opinionated, often funny and occasionally heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Of “the relationship between Hitler’s campaign on the eastern front and Richard Burton’s pageboy haircut”. It’s full of faded and non-Anglophone stars (Egon Friedell, Arthur Schnitzler, Marcel Reich-Ranicki, Paz, Urena), villains (Brassilach, Celine, Pound, Sartre, Brecht), pop-defining celebrities (Beatrix Potter, Dick Cavett, Michael Mann) and sad outrage. <br/><br/>It’s also or really an autobiography, a list of the people and one-liners that struck James as he travelled the century. WW2 and the Soviet Empire dominate as the most deadly instances of the theme “how politics invaded art and came close to killing it”. <br/><br/>Other themes: irrational violence, the nonconformist left, collaborators and fellow-travellers, Jewish achievements, the failure of totalitarian simplicity, ‘the American century’, rise and fall of jazz. He falls for clash-of-civilisation talk a bit, but he’s never conservative without a reason. I think what I love about him is that he stands up for boring truths – ‘<i>it takes another power to keep a power in check’, “the law’s imperfections are tokens of its necessity</i>” etc. <br/><br/>For every villain we are given a counter exemplar: Marc Bloch, Sophie Scholl, Jorge Borges...  <br/><br/>This is my second read-through in five years; I expect to read it again in another five. <br/></td>
