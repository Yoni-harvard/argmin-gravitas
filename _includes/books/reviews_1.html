Durrell's prose is good, even - just the lightest touch of experimentality over classicism - but the sighing Art of it all made it impossible to go further than a hundred pages.<br/><br/>Suddenly I see wholesomeness, wit and concision in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2297137275"><i>The Magus</i></a>. So Durrell is the real magician.<br/><br/>I liked the gag at the end of <i>Justine</i> - there's a sentence regarding <i>everything, man</i>, but the footnote for that sentence points at a completely and intentionally blank page. Oh but it wasn't a gag, it was a deep reflection of being and nonbeing. Fuck it then.<br/><br/>This was the only book I had on me for several hours and I still couldn't hack it. I rather stared at the wall.</td>

      <td><i>Smarter: The New Science of Building Brain Power</i> (2013) by Dan Hurley</td>
      <td><blockquote><i>I still did not understand why they have taken such a stand against the large and growing body of evidence showing that working memory and fluid intelligence can be increased through training.</i></blockquote><br/>(Because it mostly wasn't very good evidence, Dan.)<br/><br/>Gladwellian (i.e. chatty overinterpretation of immature social science) with a side dose of uninteresting self-experimentation. More than half of this is about brain training, which has unfortunately lost most of its scientific veneer in the five years since it was published. (<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1037/a0028228">Here are</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616635612">some</a> <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1177/1529100616661983">large negative</a> <a href="https://www.gwern.net/DNB-meta-analysis#moderators">meta-analyses</a>.) To some extent this is not his fault - I did n-back for a while myself in 2013, and he cites all the top people (he's in love with credentials and committee memberships). But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">crisis</a> made a mockery of many top people. They crowed about lifting the 'curse of learning specificity' (that no training regime seems to produce a general increase in fluid intelligence). The curse has since reasserted its gloom. <br/><br/>He makes dozens of errors of interpretation (for instance, the Abecedarian preschool programme which he enthuses about made no long-term intelligence gains; for instance not distinguishing active and passive controls). And he gives no attention to the biggest interventions, quality sleep (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20604614">-6 points</a> per hour lost) and education (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618774253">3 points per year</a>(!)). Also, music instruction for cognition didn't replicate. <br/><br/>Serves me right for reading a journalist on any topic but journalism, I suppose. He gives, I think, only one effect size, despite citing hundreds of studies in prose. There's only one moment where he does actual journalism and pushes back against the hasty commercialisation of immature science. <br/><br/>Useful as an example of how not to write about science; about the spurious <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/03/03/more-on-replication-crisis/">omnicausal</a> implications of low-power psychology studies; as a reminder that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence (and anything nonmedical to do with <i>Gf</i> gains is extraordinary); and maybe if you're interested in verbatim conference backbiting.<br/><br/>His self-experiment is invalidated before it starts (even as an <i>n</i>-of-one thing) because he decides to wake up early (again, the cognitive penalty of 2 fewer hours of sleep dwarfs the boosters' estimates of brain training + exercise + nicotine):<br/><blockquote><i>I... wrote out my training schedule. I would wake up at 6:00 a.m. instead of my usual 8:00 a.m.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>His lowest moment: Trying to understand the balance of evidence about brain training and <i>g</i>, Hurley's meta-analytic method is to literally count the studies that found, or didn't find, a significant effect:<br/><blockquote><i>In the years following publication [of the original n-back study], a grand total of four randomized, controlled studies have been published finding no benefit of cognitive training... Yet in contrast, by my count, seventy-five other randomized, controlled studies have now been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals confirming that cognitive training substantially improves.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>He tries to critique the 2013 meta-analysis, but is unable to, because he doesn't know how to estimate study quality, and crapness matters <i>far</i> more than quantity.<br/><br/>How to avoid finding ourselves in Hurley's position? Well, first off avoid writing a book about any young social science (<i>n</i>-back was 11 years old when he wrote this so the rule might have to be "more than a couple of decades old"). The lack of consensus (in a relatively nonpoliticised field) is another warning sign: not because science is quick at resolving bullshit disagreements, but because it means the effects can't be very large, are hiding in <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/04/21/feather-bathroom-scale-kangaroo/">the background noise</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogmed">surprisingly large</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumosity">amounts of money</a> the findings spurred probably didn't help with confirmation bias and hostility. Listen to the grumpy bastards (Randy Engle, mocked as a "defender of the [specificity] faith" in this, was right all along). Lastly, <i>read the methodologists</i>: <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.200.7648&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Paul Meehl</a> and others were warning us of the general statistical shoddiness of psychology more than forty years ago.<br/><br/>It's an important topic and he actually navigates the tricky nicotine vs tobacco literature well (spoiler: <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nicotine">it's really good</a>). But <a href="https://www.gwern.net/DNB-meta-analysis">read</a> <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics">Gwern</a> and <a href="https://examine.com/search/?q=nicotine">Examine</a> instead.

      <td><i>User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development</i> (2004) by Mike Cohn</td>
      <td>I recently learned a fundamental dichotomy in expressing oneself: you use either the '<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5317066/2007-esoteric-writing-pedagogy.pdf">esoteric</a>' or the '<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/hanson-joins-cu.html">exoteric</a>' mode. (The exoteric writer says exactly what she means, minimises ambiguity and tries to do everything with explicit reasoning, for the largest audience they can, with imagery and irony only as decoration. The esoteric writer – distinct from, but often coextensive with the woo-woo mystical metaphysics fans also called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esotericism">esoteric</a> – does the converse. <br/><br/>Most ancient writers wrote esoterically, which is one reason that undergrads and other fools, like me, think that ancient writers are vague and low on content. Up to now, I have been confusing the rhetorical stance - see Heidegger, Deleuze, Derrida, Caputo - with the magickal crap. But so much of the Analytic / Continental divide can be explained in this single distinction! [The revival of the distinction is due to that lionized demon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_and_the_Art_of_Writing">Leo Strauss</a>.] Maths is an interesting border case, but its clarity and attempt to destroy ambiguity make it exoteric, I think.) <br/><br/>The exoteric intention strikes me as firstly just good manners and important for intellectual honesty (accountability, critical clarity). But one thing I dislike about studying computer science is that <i>all</i> the materials are utterly exoteric. I crave art and irreverence in formal contexts, and those are always at least somewhat esoteric. The ‘Agile’ software thing strikes me as good, a way of making the hag-ridden and monstrously expensive dev process work. But all the material around Agile, LEAN (and the wider business-marketing-HR-systems theory blah that represents most employed adults’ only engagement with passably academic work) is so exoteric that something in me rebels. <br/></td>

(To be fair, <em>any</em> overview has to cover French theory, because that's what our counter-gender people have actually been up to<em> for decades</em>. But not blind acceptance.) <br/><br/>You get the impression, here, that progress in feminist thought consists in calling your predecessors bigoted - JS Mill calls out the Victorians, Okin calls out JS Mill, Butler calls out Okin, Wittig calls out Butler, and then Calhoun calls <em><a href="http://www.glbtq.com/literature/wittig_m.html">Wittig</a></em> heteronormative.</td>

Instead there is second-hand gossip dressed up as historical context and post-structuralist intertextuality (“Jaussian reception theory”: the discussion of reviews,  ad campaigns, corporate manoeuvring).

(Redundancies: he splits illusion of control and action bias, the paradox of choice and decision fatigue...) Consider the ‘It’s-gotta-get-worse-before-it-gets-better effect’. <br/><br/>The big problem for the heuristics and biases program is when you get contradictory pairs of biases – how can people be both ? The actual researchers have done well in synthesising these and providing base-rates for effect sizes (without which, the programme is little more than a new way for intellectuals to insult each other).
