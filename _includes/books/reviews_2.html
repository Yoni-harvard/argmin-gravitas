      <td><i>The Lost Worlds of 2001</i> (1971) by Arthur C. Clarke</td>
      <td>Read while passing time in someone else's house.<br/><br/>Lots of detail about Kubrick's brutal whims and maniacally hands-on approach to everything. (In preproduction he threw the bones into the air and filmed the arc himself, apparently, nearly giving himself a head injury.) They both come across as two quite silly men with odd amounts of access to astronauts and presidents and captains of industry.<br/><br/>I was expecting to see something about <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/01/close-tears-he-left-intermission-how-stanley-kubrick-upset-arthur-c-clarke">Clarke's dismay</a> (at working for several years at something essentially discarded), but he totally kept it out of this.<br/><br/>Most of this is deleted scenes from the novel. They're very thin and discardable.</td>

      <td><i>Elysium Fire (Prefect Dreyfus Emergency, #2)</i> (2018) by Alastair Reynolds</td>
      <td>Both rushed and too long. Characters do lots of excessively dumb stuff, including the most sober and clever characters, Dreyfus and Aumonier, who both act like Maverick badasses here. The contrivance at the beginning (to artificially promote Ng and concoct some drama with Sparver) is too transparent. Way too many board meetings with people doing an increment of exposition and muttering darkly.<br/><br/>There is another scary exponential problem, but unlike in the last book, halfway through it gets capped at 2000 potential deaths. Intentionally small stakes can be good (see <i>Cibola Burn</i> from the Expanse series), but here it just sends up the emoting and silliness from previously professional agents.<br/><br/>Still readable, but it undermines the characters that made the first pop.</td>

      <td><i>At the Strangers' Gate: Arrivals in New York</i> (2017) by Adam Gopnik</td>
      <td>Gopnik is one of the best writers alive, in the limited sense that his prose is unerring and musical, that he can make any subject interesting for twenty minutes. But this book, about being young, poor, and dizzily romantic in 80s New York, is too thin, 90% style. I don't resent reading about him and his wife hanging around department stores, nor even the long passage praising his wife, but I also don't take away anything beyond the mouthfeel of his words.<br/><br/>In some sense their impractical romanticism - spending their last savings on one fancy suit, appreciating graffiti, lingering around Bloomingdale's not buying anything - was straightforwardly aspirational and material. Not bohemian, or, temporarily, on the way up, merely waiting to become an aesthete and, glory of glories, a tastemaker. This is the great tension of arty people, particularly if (as the Gopniks do not) you have pretensions to moral superiority: really you are rejecting one consumerism for another. Book people get away with this most, because the sensuality and pleasure of great writing is hidden between the covers. One solution is to get into high-status trash (you can't be accused of narrow sensualism for liking Tracey Emin or Billy Childish); far more common is to contort yourself so that liking and buying art <i>is</i> a moral action, if not a cleaner and more beautifully non-instrumental kind of moral action than merely doing something for someone.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>It’s human nature to turn a mouth taste into a moral taste—to make a question of how something feels in your mouth into a question of what it says about your world. That’s the basis of every dietary law. When we imagine God, we don’t imagine him indifferent to appetite. No, we imagine him enraged and enraptured by what we’re eating—he tastes bacon and declares it bad and tastes matzo and can hear a whole heroic history when he breaks it. Every mouth taste instantly becomes a moral taste. And so when we need to fight—and no marriage can survive without some useful friction—we fight about food...<br/><br/>The restaurants of New York enraptured me—we didn’t go to any, but I loved the idea of them. I would lie in bed, after we unrolled and enwrapped the “triple fold” sofa every night, and read what was then the premier guide to New York dining out, Seymour Britchky’s <i>The Restaurants of New York</i>... It’s a vanished tone now, in the age of mass amateur reviews on Open Spoon or Table Talk or whatever the current forum is called. (“I took my honey here for birthday dinner, and—wow!—what a blowout. Five stars, for sure.”)<br/><br/>At the time, though, his criticism... seemed thrilling in the power of its sneering, the certitude of its exclusions. The power critic of this kind depends on the lightning turns of his contempt and his favour: no one should ever be sure where he would land, or on whom.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Note the smooth way in which a cool irreverent idea - "<i>It’s human nature to turn a mouth taste into a moral taste</i>" - becomes a certain precept "<i>Every mouth taste instantly becomes a moral taste</i>" just by lightness and repetition. This is the downside of being this good at prose: you can make things sound simpler than they are.<br/><br/>The humour is ever-present but vanishingly slight. When he loses his only pair of suit trousers, he devotes five pages to a comic lament for them. But it's the echo of comedy.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>I've never recovered them. Because the truth is that what we learn in New York is that a piece of plywood will never protect you from the wild, and that and that suit trousers, once lost, are lost forever. The city makes you the opposite of the emperor with the new clothes. He walked around unclothed, and everyone noticed but him. In New York, you walk around naked from the waist down for decades, and nobody knows but you.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>There are still three or four wonderful points, the best of the <i>New Yorker</i>'s shallow profundity<br/><blockquote><i><br/>The idea of the cash machine, which now seems either self-evident or dated, seemed exciting then. Cautiously withdrawing thirty-five dollars at a time from our tiny fund, and doing it first at the Chase machine on Third Avenue but soon at cash machines all over town... we came into a different daily relation to money than our parents had done. My grandparents had belonged to a check-cashing generation, proud to be engaged in it. To have an institution as large as an American bank in effect endorse their signature on a little bit of paper as equivalent to money meant to be taken seriously as a citizen. My parents, in turn, were credit card cultists – they loved having them, signing them, showing them, using them. For those who came of age in the boom times after the Second World War, the whole notion of credit, of sharing in a limitless improving future – of being trusted to buy now and pay later, since later would be so much richer than now – had some of the same significance that the notion of being trusted with checks had for my grandparents.<br/><br/>We, in turn, generationally, had regressed, I realized back into a cash economy – we used checks just to pay the utilities. The machines were one more instrument of that infantilization; we went to the machines for something that felt, at least, like our allowance.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/></td>

      <td><i>The Odyssey</i> (-700) by Homer</td>
      <td>I don't want to hector Homer. But somehow this was both boring and evil, both childish and didactic. I won't belabour the book's immorality, since it is so obvious; it's the near-total absence of artistic merit that is apparently not obvious. I found nothing in it worth reading or quoting until Book 9, nearly half way through. Songs of praise of warmongering pirates. (People love pirates, and I say let em. Just don't call them paragons.) <br/><br/>The ideology is dad porn, a set of thin, obvious, animal values. "Kings do whatever they want - death for messing with a noble; don't cross the priests; offer huge sacrifices; always do what your husband and dad say; the unlucky and the disabled are cursed and to be shunned; blood is blood is blood." <br/><blockquote><i>    The ghost<br/>    of Agamemnon answered, “Lucky you,<br/>    cunning Odysseus: you got yourself<br/>    a wife of virtue—great Penelope.<br/>    How principled she was, that she remembered<br/>    her husband all those years! Her fame will live<br/>    forever, and the deathless gods will make<br/>    a poem to delight all those on earth<br/>    about intelligent Penelope.<br/></i></blockquote>(Odysseus sleeps with half a dozen other women and demigods, most of them begging him to, and needless to say suffers nothing of it.)<br/><br/>There's no mention of the suffering of the several cities he sacks, or the many tacitly raped women. Dozens of people are murdered for being rude, though. For a quasi-sacred text there's a surprising amount of unpunished priest killing (e.g. Leodes).<br/><br/>The structure is awful: we see almost nothing of Odysseus for the first quarter of the poem, instead following his son around as he listens to a series of boring old men. Most of Odysseus' feats are not shown, are instead related by him as unaffecting stories. (I suppose we could amuse ourselves by treating this as unreliable narration, but they certainly didn't.) And the poem doesn't end at its climax, instead meandering on through another few books of pointless back-patting.<br/><br/>(Should I go easy? After all, this is groundbreaking work, the <i>prototype</i> of art. Sure; I'll go easy if you stop hyping it and making everyone read it as an exemplar.)<br/>(It's not that they could easily have been otherwise. Too poor, too lawless, too near to nature.)<br/><br/>It must be a cliche among classicists that the 'Classical' civilisations were not <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/classical">classical</a> in the sense of being austere, logical, tasteful, or contemplative. That they were not Apollonian, that only a handful of people in them were. I hope my rant here is not just me being misled by the modern sense of "hero" - but the fact is that Odysseus wins, is praised endlessly, and his rights trump all else.<br/><br/>This isn't just me being clueless, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orality">post-oral</a>, and close-minded: The ancients were well aware that the ending is unsatisfying crap. One popular headcanon was that, after Odysseus slays the suitors, he is immediately exiled from Ithaca, set adrift again. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPrd8FoClAA">Cue the music!</a><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>One reading of Odysseus' name is as variant of the verb '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus#Name,_etymology,_and_epithets">to be hated</a>'. So a calque might be "King Punchable of Ithaca". ("the most unhappy man alive")<br/><br/>Odysseus is treated incredibly well by almost everyone, despite his crimes. Complete strangers oil him up and dress him in fine "woolen cloak and tunic" <i>eleven times</i>, and he is given precious weaponry and potions for nothing several times. This is supposed to reflect on him, but instead it shows the Greek ideal of hospitality, one of the few nice things in that culture.<br/><br/>He appears to sincerely miss Ithaca (his status more than his wife), weeping frequently. But he also fucks about all the time, for instance staying an entire year voluntarily enjoying Circe.<br/><br/>It is completely unclear what O does to deserve his fortune. (Whereas his misfortune is always directly linked to his own machismo or idiocy.) The only virtues we see him exercise directly (not counting brute aggression and discus throwing) are courage and cunning (specifically lying). Ok, he also makes one good speech:<br/><blockquote><i>'Listen to me, my friends, despite your grief.<br/>We do not know where darkness lives, nor dawn,<br/>nor where the sun that shines upon the world<br/>goes underneath the earth, nor where it rises.<br/>We need a way to fix our current plight,<br/>but I do not know how...</i></blockquote><br/>I suppose we can put the rest down to charisma, the oddest and least rational of human powers.<br/><blockquote><i>'It seems that everybody loves this man,<br/>and honors him, in every place we sail to.'</i></blockquote><br/>Everyone extols him without him ever demonstrating the virtues they extol. (Politeness, propriety, wisdom, strategy...) Every other idiot is "godlike" at something or other, and seeing the state of their gods you see how this could be true. At least it's funny:<br/><blockquote><i>He went out of his bedroom like a god</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>King Menelaus, you are right... Your voice is like a god's to us.</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>Majestic, holy King Alcinous<br/>leapt out of bed, as did Odysseus<br/>the city-sacker. Then the blessed king,<br/>mighty Alcinous, led out his guest...</i></blockquote><br/>(The gods are stupid mirrors of Greek nobility; for instance they have supernatural slaves, the nymphs.) This at least is a philosophical difference between them and I: in their superstitious idealist mode, properties aren't for describing the present, but instead the timeless essence of a thing:<br/><blockquote><i>Ships are "black", "hollow", "swift" or "curved", never "brown", "slow" or "wobbly"... Penelope is "prudent Penelope", never "swift-footed Penelope", even if she is moving quickly. Telemachus is thoughtful, even when he seems particularly immature.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>All the feats of the heroes are totally dependent on the power of gods. If they say you can't sail, you can't. <blockquote><i>His skin <br/>would have been ripped away, and his bones smashed<br/>had not Athena given him a thought.</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>Athena poured unearthly charm<br/>upon his head and shoulders, and she made him<br/>taller and sturdier, so these Phaecians<br/>would welcome and respect him.</i></blockquote><br/>Without Hermes or Athena constantly intervening, O would be nowhere, achieve nothing. One nice tension here though:<br/><blockquote><i>But death is universal. Even gods<br/>cannot protect the people that they love,<br/>when fate and cruel death catch up with them.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>One of the few times I felt sympathy for Odysseus was when he was trying to lead his men, who are mainly large-adult-sons. (Same with the suitors.) One breaks his neck falling down a ladder. They undo a month of work by playing with the bag of winds. Several times they are totally paralysed by their wailing and tantrums. <br/><blockquote><i>As when <br/>a herd of cows is coming back from pasture<br/>into the yard; and all the little heifers<br/>jump from their pens to skip and run towards<br/>their mothers, and they cluster round them, mooing;<br/>just so my men, as soon they saw me, <br/>began to weep...</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>The other men... <br/>wept for those that died. I ordered them<br/>to stop their crying, scowling hard at each.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Odysseus occasionally draws his sword on them for backtalking him, or running around like Muppets. Their deaths are roughly equally due to Odysseus' aggression and avarice, and their own foolishness.<br/><br/>I cheered the uprising against him, who are completely in the right. But of course they lose, because of mere divine intervention.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>OK I lied: I will talk about evil. Though by the end of this I was jaded and dismissive, the aftermath of Odysseus slaughtering the suitors still struck me as an atrocity unusual for the genre:<br/><blockquote><i>"When the whole house is set in proper order,<br/>restore my halls to health: take out the [slave] girls<br/>between the courtyard wall and the rotunda.<br/>Hack at them with long swords, eradicate<br/>all life from them. They will forget the things<br/><b>the suitors made them do</b> with them in secret,<br/>through Aphrodite..."<br/><br/>"I refuse to grant these girls<br/>a clean death, since they poured down shame on me<br/>and Mother, when they lay beside the suitors."<br/><br/>At that, he would a piece of sailor's rope<br/>round the rotunda...<br/>just so the girls, their heads all in a row,<br/>were strung up with the noose around their necks<br/>to make their death an agony. They gasped,<br/>feet twitching for a while, but not for long.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>I've read de Sade, Kaczynski, Himmler, Houellebecq, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Virologist">Egan</a> and <a href="https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm">Watts</a> at their most dyspeptic; it's not that I'm squeamish about real or fictional evil, or that my sulking sense of justice blinds me to aesthetics. This sort of thing happened; nothing cannot be said; maybe even nothing cannot be said beautifully. It's just that, again, there is nearly no nobility and no classicism in this. I am so glad this culture is gone.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Did its audience know the story was bullshit? Or was it scripture to them? (Like most scripture, it is pathetically ignoble, violent, and self-serving.) Well, <a href="https://www.franksmitha.com/history/homer.htm">they don't seem</a> to have had scripture, not even Hesiod. So Homer is more like Dante or Milton for them: not sacred, but pious and moralising.<br/><br/>How big was mighty Troy? How noble was godlike Odysseus? How petty their pantheon? How long this epic?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>* Even thought-provoking bits like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus-eaters">lotus eaters</a> or Cyclopean anarchism are over in less than half a page.<br/><br/>* Surprised when Zeus was described as "husband of Hera". <br/><br/>* The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outis#Origin_of_the_name">no man</a>" pun thing was so stupid I had to put the book down for a couple of days.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Normally I would stop reading a book this bad, but I read it to prepare for <i>Ulysses</i>, so I dragged myself through.<br/><br/>Wilson's introduction takes up a quarter of the entire book. It's good and sane but repetitive, taking pains to spell out all the ignoble and questionable, all the ugly and clumsy parts. I don't know how she keeps up her enthusiasm for the book, in the face of them, but more power to her.<br/><br/>Plus two points for Wilson's intro and demystified translation.</td>

      <td><i>The Ph.D. Grind: A Ph.D. Student Memoir</i> (2012) by Philip J. Guo</td>
      <td><blockquote><i>Question: Is your book meant as a critique of academia or a call for reform?<br/>Absolutely not. I don't have any agenda besides telling my own story as honestly as possible.<br/></i></blockquote><blockquote><i>most Ph.D. students are directly training for a job that they will never get. (Imagine how disconcerting it would be if medical or law school graduates couldn’t get jobs as doctors or lawyers, respectively.)</i></blockquote><br/>Strange one. It's 100 pages of minor mental breakdowns, ten thousand hours of mind-numbing gruntwork, stupid status games, and disillusionment - all in plain, businesslike, affectless prose. Also, there's very little technical detail in it. You'd think he was describing painting a house, rather than a painful initiation into the partially-insane system of <i>placing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">logic incarnate</a> in harness</i> (a system with surprisingly weak links to discovery and progress).<br/><blockquote><i>research was my only job, and I wouldn’t be able to earn a degree unless I succeeded at it. My mood was inextricably tied to how well I was progressing every day, and during those months, progress was painfully slow.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>He spends two years of his life on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">nasty little problems</a>, thousands of hours of config and debugging, nothing to show for it, no papers, no new results. The top CS schools don't let you graduate until you get 4 papers in "top" conferences: layers upon layers of luck and gatekeeping, only modestly correlated with your efforts. Oh, and you are unlikely to have much choice of project either. A recipe for misery. This is at the very top of the game, too: Stanford with full funding and annual internships at the big lads. It is both reassuring and horrifying to hear that elite groups waste months and submit total shit sometimes.<br/><i><blockquote>In the end, it took three attempts by four Ph.D. students over the course of five years before Dawson’s initial Klee-UC idea turned into a published paper. Of those four students, only one “survived”—I quit the Klee project, and two others quit the Ph.D. program altogether.</i></blockquote><br/>Guo is no Jeremiah: despite his suffering, despite his very penetrating analysis of the waste and the idiocies, he doesn't declaim the system. He just analyses the narrow, nonscientific incentives of those around him and gets on with winning the game. He talks like this: "<i>i think that leveraging [software] and aligning with both of your interests and incentives will be the best way for me to both make a contribution and also to feel satisfied about making concrete forward progress every day.</i>”. He uses 'top-tier' without scare quotes. At one point he dispassionately notes that half a dozen of his papers were rejected because he wasn't fluent in the specific sub-field's “rhetorical tricks, newfangled buzzwords, and marketing-related contortions required to satisfy reviewers". That is, he comes up against bullshit Bourdieuan micro-distinctions, boundary work, irrelevant to science, and shrugs and sets about learning how to pass as an insider. Look elsewhere <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/15/can-twitter-save-science/">for the</a> <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/grad">relevant</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2010/12/16/the-disposable-academic">denunciations</a>. <br/><br/>It would be cynical to think that he doesn't milk the politics of postgraduate pain because he landed well, is a professor now - instead just envy him his inner calm:<br/><blockquote><i>my six years of Ph.D. training have made me wiser, savvier, grittier, and more steely, focused, creative, eloquent, perceptive, and professionally effective than I was as a fresh college graduate. (Two obvious caveats: Not every Ph.D. student received these benefits—many grew jaded and burned-out from their struggles. Also, lots of people cultivate these positive traits without going through a Ph.D. program.)... <br/>Pursuing a Ph.D. has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life, and I feel extremely lucky to have been given the opportunity to be creative during this time.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>There is this to be said for the American seven year ditch: Guo was able to suffer and wander for three entire years before he had his first big idea. That's the other side: the incredible privilege of being paid to read, paid to talk to clever people, paid to think new thoughts. But who says privileges have to feel nice, or not drive you half-mad?<br/><br/>A very valuable warning for some tiny fraction of the world, a flat curio for some other tiny voyeur fraction.</td>

      <td><i>Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</i> (2016) by Cal Newport</td>
      <td>Quite shallow. He uses himself and Carl Jung as exemplars of the method - "I published 4 books in 10 years" and so on - but why should I judge either of them to have made a positive impact, merely because they published a lot? <br/><br/>Lots of cherry-picked anecdotes in the normal bad self-help mode, with no attention to <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/">survivorship bias</a>. <i>Deep Work</i> has the same feel as the disgraced <a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/"><i>Why We Sleep</i></a>: empirically sloppy exaggeration of a plausibly ultra-important topic. Unlike Walker, Newport is not explicitly claiming scientific authority though.<br/><br/>The topic is networked technology as a force against individual productivity. There's a weak and a strong form:<br/><br/><ul><br/><li><i>Weak</i>: "You need to focus to do great work, or to learn new hard things. And work on the Internet is extremely vulnerable to distraction and tends to be less focussed."</li><br><br/><br/><li><i>Strong</i>: "The always-on fragmentary state of being caused by addictive technology is <i>disabling</i>. It has lasting developmental effects, reducing your attention span, serenity, perspective." (Lanier, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/11/shallows-internet-changing-way-think">Carr</a>.)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/>Newport makes both claims ("<i>Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.</i>"), and the strong one is poorly justified to say the least. But the weak form is plausible and important enough on its own.<br/><br/>I wondered how much this was just a rehash of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a> idea, and in fact Newport does give it its due. It seems fair to update the idea after 40 great years of tech and the culture of tech. (I had no mobile phone until I was 17, no smartphone until I was 27. My abstinence would be much harder now.)<br/><br/>The weak evidence could be forgiven if the claims were weaker, or if the tone was less pompous. Plus two stars for being about an important possibility, minus one for being unrigorous, minus one for tone.<br/><br/>Things I try to do:<br/><br/>* Track your amount of deep work hours every day.<br><br/>* Protect your morning: get out of bed quickly and don't browse.<br><br/>* Do "time blocking", earmarking a whole day for focused work<br><br/>* Batch shallow work (emails, meetings) in one time slots, probably the evening.<br/>* Leave your phone in a different room. <br/><br/>He talks about scheduling your entire day, which I suspect is perverse. And "become hard to reach" is only possible for people who are already successful / in particular careers. ymmv.</td>

Downgrade your credence in all nonfiction that's outside your expertise, including reviews like this one.]<br/><br><br/><br/>Walker: <blockquote><i>\tScientists have discovered a revolutionary treatment that makes you live longer. It enhances your memory and makes you more creative. It makes you look more attractive. It keeps you slim and lowers food cravings. It protects you from cancer and dementia. It wards off colds and the flu. It lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke, not to mention diabetes. You’ll even feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious. Are you interested?<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Important topic: he claims there's a free, riskless intervention to add years to your lifespan and fundamentally improve your mind. (The flip side of this claim is a horror story about a society that mentally disables its members.)<br/><br/>Our school system, ladies and gents:<br/><blockquote><i>\tMore than 80 percent of public high schools in the United States begin before 8:15 a.m. Almost 50 percent of those start before 7:20 a.m. School buses for a 7:20 a.m. start time usually begin picking up kids at around 5:45 a.m. As a result, some children and teenagers must wake up at 5:30 a.m., 5:15 a.m., or even earlier, and do so five days out of every seven, for years on end. This is lunacy...<br/><br/>\tPreviously, we noted that the circadian rhythm of teenagers shifts forward dramatically by one to three hours. So really the question I should ask you, if you are an adult, is this: Could you concentrate and learn anything after having forcefully been woken up at 3:15 a.m., day after day after day? Would you be in a cheerful mood? Would you find it easy to get along with your coworkers and conduct yourself with grace, tolerance, respect, and a pleasant demeanor? Of course not. Why, then, do we ask this of the millions of teenagers and children in industrialized nations?<br/></i></blockquote><br/>And elsewhere he notes that time in school is useless without restfulness. Burn it down.<br/><blockquote><i>\tInsufficient sleep has also been linked to aggression, bullying, and behavioral problems in children across a range of ages. A similar relationship between a lack of sleep and violence has been observed in adult prison populations; places that, I should add, are woefully poor at enabling good sleep that could reduce aggression, violence, psychiatric disturbance, and suicide<br/></i></blockquote><br/>The theory of sleep (circadian rhythm and adenosine cycle determining when, NREM and REM determining what) is very neat but I'm not qualified to say if it's mature. There's also vast and baffling cross-species variation, which Walker doesn't pretend to understand: "<i>amount (e.g., [hours per day]), form (e.g., half-brain, whole-brain), and pattern (monophasic, biphasic, polyphasic)</i>" or ground / tree.<br/><br/>The adenosine cycle - the absolutely failsafe connection between activity and fatigue - is one of my favourite theories in biology. (The account here doesn't do it justice.)<br/><br/>He's sceptical of <a href="http://gwern.net/Melatonin">oral melatonin</a> <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">therapy</a>, but he doesn't consider the main argument in favour, which is that our many hours of blue-light at night is a systematic deviation from ancestral conditions, with no sensible alternative mitigation (f.lux can only do so much). (He instead puts faith in warm LEDs and smart bulbs, currently thousands of dollars each.) At least he doesn't spread the <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/melatonin/">unsupported idea</a> that taking it results in negative hormonal feedback.  This doesn't surprise me:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>\tScientific evaluations of over-the-counter brands have found melatonin concentrations that range from 83 percent less than that claimed on the label, to 478 percent more than that stated<br/></i></blockquote><br/>- but this is the price of having it over-the-counter in the first place. (It is anyway completely safe to take a 6x dose, just much less effective.)<br/><br/>He's very in favour of afternoon naps, the "biphasic" pattern, based on relatively weak observational evidence:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>\tthose that abandoned regular siestas went on to suffer a 37 percent increased risk of death from heart disease across the six-year period, relative to those who maintained regular daytime naps."<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>There's lots of evolutionary speculation, which really pisses off some readers for some reason, even when tagged as speculation. (e.g. Do teenagers stay up later to procreate outwith parental supervision?)<br/><br/>He is a crusader all right - for instance, he doesn't really do any cost-benefit consideration, instead just maximising sleep, even instead of taking your asthma meds. Yes, the costs of sleep deprivation are extremely high - but so's the cost of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7972077/against-oversleeping">spending 30 years in a coma</a>.<br/><br/>I think I'm pretty much optimised: I already quit caffeine, redshifted all screens, got 0.3mg melatonin, started wearing an eye mask, don't drink much, exercise every day, fixed a bedtime, and live somewhere quiet with big bedroom windows. (I also got a less melodramatic and anxious worldview by studying <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2426950247">economic history</a>, which Walker doesn't cover - fair enough, since the intervention can only help scared intellectuals.) Things which I enjoy enough to handle the sleep cost: nicotine and eating late. <br/><br/><br/><blockquote><i>Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep:<br/><br/>1. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.<br/>2. Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. <br/>3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. <br/>4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. <br/>5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. <br/>6. If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep.<br/>7. Don’t take naps after 3 p.m. <br/>8. Relax before bed... reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual.<br/>9. Take a hot bath before bed. <br/>10. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom.<br/>11. Have the right sunlight exposure. Try to get outside in natural sunlight for at least thirty minutes each day.<br/>12. Don’t lie in bed awake... get up and do some relaxing activity until you feel sleepy. <br/><br/></i></blockquote></td>

Includes a (true) evolutionary gradient:<br/><blockquote><i>Earth our father knew He would need clever life, so He used the Seasons to shape us out of animals: clever hands for making things and clever minds for solving problems and clever tongues for working together and clever sessapinae to warn us of danger.  The people became what Father Earth needed, and then more than He needed.  Then we turned on Him, and He has burned with hatred for us ever since.</i></blockquote><br/>She later ruins this interesting cosmogony by clubbing you over the head with a message (that the lethal climate shock Seasons started after people polluted the world too much).<br/><br/>The world is a blend of <i>GoT</i> survivalist folk religion and apocalyptically cyclical climate, <i>X-Men</i> despised chaos mages, <i>Battlestar</i> breeding body horror, <i>Earthsea</i> folk magic and wu wei, and superstitious racism. It mostly works.<br/><br/><b>Structure</b>: Three quite different focal characters, later shown to be the same person over time. I didn't spot the first unification coming, and it was satisfying.<br/><br/>She leaves the big <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">Soylent Green</a> reveal until page 108; until then you're left wondering if all the grey objectification is justified by the terrible security risk. <br/><br/>She's pretty glib about the two communities outside the Empire, full of earthquake witches who are shown regularly freezing or nuking things when even mildly irked. The utopian pirate community is also heavily rose-tinted - sure, they <i>do</i> kill people in order to take their stuff in a time of terrible scarcity... but hey they're really sexually liberated and not racist at all.<br/><br/><b>Inconsistent</b>: High Fantasy (subsisting commune agrarians, feudalism, omnipotent wizards) which also boasts C20th science, somehow. An in-universe history book describes one catastrophe as:<br/><blockquote><i>"aerosolizing sufficient steam and particulate matter to trigger acidic rain and sky occlusion over the Somidlats..."</i></blockquote><br/>They have penicillin without an industrial revolution, electric lights before steam. Ordinary C15th cannon are an experimental wunderweapon to them. <br/>More: most births have some risk (<1%) of being a giant nuclear volcano generator, but the Evil Empire does nothing to control reproduction, and has the parents administer very insecure self-regulation. <br/><br/><b>Pretentious portentousness</b>:<br/><blockquote><i>There passes a time of happiness in your life, which I will not describe to you. It is unimportant. Perhaps you think it wrong that I dwell so much on the horrors, the pain, but pain is what shapes us, after all. We are creatures born of heat and pressure and grinding, ceaseless movement. To be still is to be... not.<br/></i></blockquote>Of a character which until about 10 pages earlier had been a despised / tolerated frenemy:<br/><blockquote><i>now your eyes are drawn away from the horror that remains of your mentor, your lover, your friend...</i></blockquote><br/>I forgive Ada Palmer this style. But 1) she's not that bad; 2) she's aping the sentimentalist C18th, and 3) she has far greater philosophical sense.<br/><br/><b>Glib</b>: <br/><blockquote><i>it turns out that the comm is called Meov, and the man who has stepped forward is Harlas, their headman. <br/>Also they're pirates.</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>Syenite mispronounces vulgar words, inadvertently making them more vulgar, and makes instant friends of half the crew by doing so.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>"lol, applause!"<br/><br/><b>Bad slang</b>: "rogga", "comm", "orogeny" (every time, I thought "erogenous?"), really bad interjections (<i>' "Evil, eating Earth", you whisper'</i>; '<i>for shit's sake, she stilled a rusting volcano made by a broken obelisk</i>'). The occasional good bit of slang (like "grits" for the young rock mages) is smothered in exposition: <i>that's what she is now, an unimportant bit  of rock ready to be polished into usefulness...</i>. Better writers (Atwood or Le Guin or Banks) leave it up to you. Everything is spelled out here.<br/><br/>The book gets roundly worse in the second half, with two chapters (16 and 17) full of hollow plot devices and applause lights (Damaya only explores the Main building so she can drive the plot forward when the hollow character Binof arrives, immediately afterwards). Also arguably Innon, there to be objectified and let Jemisin write 'good sex' scenes.<br/><br/>Lots of Representation: polyamory, transgenderism, a dozen skin colours. Of course, fantasy doesn't represent anything, so strictly speaking that's a misnomer. It doesn't matter what the ethnic demographics of your lava-world are, relative to ours; you can have as much or as little typical sexuality etc as you like, any colour can be a minority, <i>as long as it makes sense in that world</i>. Do the choices of identities fit Jemisin's world? Is Tonkee's transgenderism, among feudalism, a personal idiosyncrasy? A hormone thing? A magic thing? We're given no reason for any of the identities she introduces to celebrate. But it mostly doesn't get in the way.<br/><br/><br/>Jemisin fumbles the "in a corrupt world, lawful complicity or violent revolution?" angle. At least in this instalment, there's little acknowledgment that killing an entire city because a handful of people in its government committed atrocities isn't on: '<i>He's not crazy at all, and he never has been</i>' <br/>"<i>what right do worlds built on oppression and genocide have to exist?</i>", asks one reviewer. Well, 'worlds' (institutions) don't have rights, people do: and people have a right to not suffer harm, e.g. the harm of having a great big earthquake dropped on you.</td>

Unfortunately the prose is really, really stiff. One of his observations is that poverty makes you unable to articulate poverty. So should I sympathise? I've a similarly uncultured background (though not a tenth as violent) and I still managed to get an ear for High English. (He isn't deep enough to analyse the politics of language, but he namechecks people who do, like Tom Leonard.)<br/><br/>And but you <i>can</i> write in Scots now, if you're great, if you're brave, as shown by Welsh (Booker Prize longlist '93), Kelman (Booker win '94) and Leonard (anthologised in the <i>Penguin Book of English Verse</i>, IMO the highest honour in poetry).<br/><blockquote><i>my sense of grievance with anyone I perceived as well-off. In my community, some people fought about football, others over politics and religion, but my simmering resentment, if not concentrated completely on my mother, lay with those in society who appeared to be doing much better than the rest of us, those who were gliding through life unimpeded by the constraints of poverty and the material disadvantage and self-doubt that comes with it.<br/><br/>This feeling of justifiable anger at the state of things, whether it be my community of even my own life, always led to some form of blame being ascribed to another group in society and, for me, middle class people fitted the bill perfectly. This bee in my bonnett has been a constant and finds expression as a sense of irritation at certain people I assume are posh; I can be irritated by an opinion, an accent, an accessory or an item of clothing...<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>    Many big sociological / psychology claims - some truisms, some false - but almost no citations for either. (e.g. He has this harebrained idea that Florida is a rich high-status place, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_poverty_rate">5 seconds on wiki</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Man">passing familiarity</a> with American memes gives the lie to that.)

Our "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_cheese">government cheese</a>".<br/><br/>There's a surprising section where he tries to tie Seneca and the other good old lads to modern common sense, to do some genealogy of morals, but he can't carry it. He also tries to square the circle of the giant malevolent nature/nuture catfight, but understandably can't lift that either.

      <td><i>Focusing</i> (1978) by Eugene T. Gendlin</td>
      <td>2/5 with an asterisk.*<br/><br/>Confusing. There's a mixture of classic self-help red flags:<br/><blockquote><i>My philosophy leads to new concepts in physics and biology... Focusing is now a worldwide network... this can seem insane to the rest of our society. How could new realistic ideas and steps arise from the body? This new institution is changing the atomization of society... Unlocking the wisdom of your body... using the body's own life-centered and inherently positive direction and force...<br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>'Focusing has been crucial for many bodyworkers. I would hope that it would be more widely integrated within the education of Somatics practitioners.</i> - Don Hanlon Johnson, Professor, California Institute of Integral Studies'<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>The most important rule for a therapist to observe, while helping someone to focus, is to stay out of the focuser's way... [Soon:] Another agitated, self-destructive emotional spiral was beginning and I interrupted her.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>IF DURING THESE INSTRUCTIONS SOMEWHERE YOU HAVE SPENT A LITTLE WHILE SENSING AND TOUCHING AN UNCLEAR HOLISTIC BODY SENSE OF THIS PROBLEM, THEN YOU HAVE FOCUSED.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>...but also things I know to be true and which aren't in the interest of a therapist / self-help guru to say:<br/><blockquote><i>Why doesn't therapy succeed more often? In the rarer cases when it does succeed, what is it that those patients and therapists do? What is it that the majority fail to do? <br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>When the revolution in self-help [democratization] takes place and people do these helpful processes with each other, will professional psychotherapy be unnecessary? <br/></i></blockquote><br/>It did take place, we are they; it didn't change much, because most of it is nonsense. I suppose it is cheaper than the old way.<br/>(There is of course the possibility that he's saying them to disarm me.)<br/><br/>I got incredibly annoyed at him going on about this 'method' for 50 pages without describing it; skip to chapter 4 if you do too. It's roughly<br/><br/>1) Clear your head<br/>2) Pick one problem and just think about it in general ("feel it holistically")<br/>3) Slowly try to find the right words to describe it<br/>4) Switch back between the "felt sense" (2) and your description a bunch.<br/>5) Wonder what it's all about. <br/>6) Continue until you feel your attitude towards it change.<br/><br/>Is this profound? No. Is it crackpot? Also no.<br/><br/>Also annoying was his dismissing alternative strategies for handling problems, all of which I sometimes like. He belittles 'belittling the problem' (e.g. reminding yourself that others have it worse - which is both noble and effective); 'analyzing' (he rightly belittles Freudian Analysis, i.e. blaming your present state on the nastiest past event that comes to mind, but <i>as if</i> breaking things into subproblems is always a bad idea); just enduring it (often just works for me); lecturing yourself (often works for me because parts of me want to listen). Why is it so hard for writers like this to concede that some things don't work for some people? (They lose authority I suppose.)<br/><br/>Surprising that he's a sincere empiricist, or at least trying to be. <br/><blockquote><i>One reason why research is so important is precisely that it can surprise you and tell you that your subjective convictions are wrong... As hard as it was for me to accept the finding that therapy doesn't do the job, research findings can never hurt you. They move you forward.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><a href="http://www.focusing.org/research_basis.html">This is a list</a> of about 100 studies on the topic (Ctrl+F "Table 1"), no doubt with a terrible file-drawer problem. Total n~=500, probably with a lot of duplication. Measures used are a mix of standard boring ones like PFQ and woo boring ones like Gestalt. <br/><br/>Gendlin makes a few specific, testable claims (which is always to be encouraged so allow me to hereby present him with his certificate of falsifiability at worst):<br/><br/>* "therapy has better outcomes when clients 'focus". Too vague, but a few of the studies are nominally about this.<br/>* "better functioning of the immune system". Only one mention of immune system in that big chart, for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8126691">this n=76 study</a>, no mention of focusing in the abstract at least.<br/>* successful patients (i.e. one-year outcomes) can be predicted from recordings of "their first two sessions". This would be good and clean evidence that something real is involved. I think the claim refers to <a href="http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp04/nq22908.pdf">this PhD</a>, n=35. It wasn't exactly cross-validated, shall we say.<br/><br/>That review was cursory but tells me enough. (You might think you could just look at clinical practice, 40 years on - which, outside of California, doesn't exactly foreground Gendlin - to get a sense of whether it works as well as he claims. But medicine is too far from a rational system for that.)<br/><br/>The core idea is not insane. It's that there is an equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception">proprioception</a> for your own emotions, and that you can't change anything about yourself except through it. There's a touch of the old Zen problem to it, that you're trying to describe a nonverbal thing in words. But then, most descriptions aren't descriptions of verbal processes - consider e.g. "Succulent plants' dark fixation makes them ideal for air quality control in bedrooms".<br/><br/>What about support from respectable, academic phenomenology? I don't know that there is any such thing. There <i>may</i> be non-propositional, non-procedural knowledge. It wouldn't be surprising - the conscious mind is a relatively small and unskilled thing. It's Gendlin's idea of our apriori and undeluded access to it that's the problem. Gendlin's experiments don't establish the existence or the access. I find it hard to think how to test this, actually. If the epistemology of focusing was real, what would be different about its practitioners? Happiness? Cortisol? Decision speed? I don't know. We are too skilled at deluding ourselves. It would be pretty easy to run an experiment where Gendlinites tried to predict which patients recover, and then check that against normies' predictions.<br/><br/>To be fair, this book isn't his strongest face ("<i>I also want this book to be readable by anyone</i>"). But I'm not grading on intended audience (and I wasn't encouraged by those no-power, pre-Crisis psychology studies either).<br/><br/>Open questions: why should there be any therapy that works in general? Grant that there is bodily knowledge; where is this knowledge stored? The enteric nervous system? Why should introspection work? Theory of mind is for modelling other people so that they can't harm me.<br/><br/>This is all probably harmless; people doing Rogerian listening to each other is unlikely to cause any problems (in fact, since it's free, then if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict">null hypothesis of talk psychotherapy</a> is true, this might be a social improvement; same benefit without the deadweight); he doesn't advocate withdrawal from treatment (pills are completely absent from the picture, actually). And the opportunity cost of trying this is low, because other self-help is worse. Not for me; maybe for you.<br/><br/>* Gendlin seems like a very nice man, he's just not the discoverer of the one neat trick to psychiatry. The emphasis (3 chapters) here on helping others and not just yourself in sweet. His acceptance of the need for science makes it easier to get at him than at other self-helpists, which makes me feel bad about getting at him and not them. (I won't get at them because they're not worth arguing with.)</td>

      <td>Pretty sensible but very long-winded and staid. I suppose it is actually quite vigorous and irreverent, coming from an organisation man:<br/><blockquote><i>study can be a substitute for productive work</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>   Darwin considered himself to be a geologist, but the world remembers largely his biology. Should Goethe be in the literature, biology, physics, or philosophy department? He actually was most proud of his work on optics, though that work was largely flawed. Would Newton or Fisher find comfortable academic niches today?</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>    All graduate students are taught that it is essential to become an expert. As a short-term goal this is, of course, valid. Academic search committees are also looking for experts. As a lifestyle, however, becoming an expert can inhibit creativity... As one becomes more of an expert, a larger and more complex network of facts and explanations accumulates and solidifies, making it difficult to entertain radical alternative ideas or to recognize new problems... An Aristotle or Freud may create a set of bars within which most people pace rigidly, never noticing clues from outside the cage</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>    it is much more likely that one can work at 100% mental clarity for about four hours. If one keeps this in mind, then a distinction can be made between critical issues that need full clarity and intense effort, which become part of the four hours of work per day, and those parts of a project that are routine and become part of the rest of the day... returning calls, coding a clearly designed subroutine, ordering equipment, attending seminars, editing reports, etc</i></blockquote><br/><br/>But these are the only interesting bits in 300 pages. This is true but the book doesn't help much:<br/><blockquote><i> scientists are largely uncoached and are rarely introspective. They spend a lot of<br/>time studying their disciplinary subject matter, but almost no time learning strategies of problem solving</i></blockquote><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>* He gives examples from <i>many</i> different domains (ecology, epidemiology, physics, hardware), but so I spotted some errors.<br/>* A new record! Loehle cites a crashing falsehood on p.2, and several times elsewhere: Gardner's DOA <a href="https://researched.org.uk/myth-busting-gardners-multiple-intelligences/">theory of multiple intelligences</a>. And he naively teases out the strategic implications. He harps on this theme repeatedly - e.g. this is also flatly false: <i>above a certain minimal level, IQ and college grades are not predictive of <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c6ef/f99ef5b7423b882b2e34034f910508fc50c6.pdf">productivity</a>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2007-strenze.pdf">success</a>, or <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-IQ-of-Nobel-Laureates">innovation</a></i>.<br/>* He tries to talk about software but is stuck in the 90s. He has no sense of open-sourcing software as the most successful strategy (witness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost#Awards">XGB</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras#Traction">Chollet</a>).<br/>* It tries to also appeal to business people, for some reason. Half the examples and advice are about corporate decisionmaking (<i>The proper focus or perspective is essential when looking at business performance.</i>) This is distracting and makes it feel generic, belies the title.<br/>* His "new model of the scientific method" is vague and doesn't deserve the word.<br/>* The chapter on social distortions (credit stealing, cherry-picking, trends and irrational effects of publication timing) is ok, just ahead of the Replication crisis curve.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Anyway: as a scientist you <i>want</i> problems. But not just any problem - something that both doesn't fit, & has important implications. Advice I read in this, or read into it:  <br/><br/>* A theory can be inconsistent or incomplete: one generate contradiction, the other keeps explanations weak.<br/>* Paradoxes are shortcuts to the frontier. Look for heated debates and find a synthesis / circumvention. When you have one: Find tacit assumptions; Make new distinctions; Operationalise!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>(Alternative books: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7672554-the-art-of-the-soluble">Medawar</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/437689.Advice_for_a_Young_Investigator">Cajal</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192221.How_to_Solve_It">Polya</a>, <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/firbush/hamming.pdf">Hamming</a>, anything by Feynman. <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~jsteinhardt/ResearchasaStochasticDecisionProcess.html">Stenhardt's model</a> is more rigorous than the rest put together but I don't know if it's helpful.)</td>

Adults might mutter something about the poll tax or <a href="https://youtu.be/QOZzFXolGJc">the shipyards</a> or the <i>Belgrano</i>, but in general people don't think about what she actually did, they just follow the received wisdom that she was a bloodthirsty high-heid ogre who killed jobs for fun. <br/><br/>(If Malcolm Rifkind is willing to write the foreword for your book, you'd be forgiven for inferring something about its slant - and indeed MR characterises the opposition as merely disliking a bossy English woman speaking down to them in RP. This is risible, and predictably risible.)<br/><br/>Torrance reports the month-by-month history. He's impatient with kneejerk anti-Thatcherism, the kind which forgets her relative electoral gains in '79 and '83, which ignores the global forces of deindustrialisation which Thatcher had relatively little power over (only unused power to slow and soften the effects).

(Little to lose by 1989, electorally.) She galvanised opposition and gave the country an Other to unite against. We threw eggs, rioted against regressive taxation, and drew funny satire - but bought our council houses off her, hoovered up our shares in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Group#Privatisation">BT</a> and Steel, and mostly accepted her careerist world, disorganised labour.

As I'm sure you know, in recent years the term play has been used to describe a certain kind of postmodern engagement with the world. To what extent do you consider your work to be postmodern?<br/><br/>    IB: I confess I don't think about it at all. I've never been good on literary or societal theory. I've long since decided people like me just write what we do and let other people worry about the analytical side.<br/><br/>    JR: Have you read any work by Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, or Emanuel Levinas (or any other continental philosophers)? If you have, what did you think?<br/><br/>    IB: The little I've read I mostly didn't understand, and the little I understood of the little I've read seemed to consist either of rather banal points made difficult to understand by deliberately opaque and obstructive language (this might have been the translation, though I doubt it), or just plain nonsense. Or it could be I'm just not up to the mark intellectually, of course.<br/><br/>    JR: You have written quite a few novels that use Freudian imagery and tropes—The Wasp Factory, Use of Weapons, The Bridge, Walking on Glass—What do you think of Freudian psychoanalysis?<br/><br/>    IB: Never been entirely sold on it. I suspect Freud's theories tell you a great deal about Freud, quite a lot about the monied middle-class in Vienna a hundred-plus years ago, and only a little about people in general. Like Marx, he was too keen to insist that his area of study was genuinely a science. Also like Marx, though, he provides a genuinely useful and insightful (if, especially in Freud's case, limited) way of looking at people and their hidden lives (well, more implied lives with Marx, relating to their economic function within a society). Anyway, I can honestly say that I've never deliberately included any Freudian imagery in my stories, so what's there must be the result of my subconscious. . . . Uh-oh. . . <br/></blockquote></td>

Some of that opinion is classist stereotype; it certainly wasn't true four hundred years ago (the devotional poems of <a href="http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/conlee-dunbar-complete-works-poems-devotional-and-moral">Dunbar</a> and Henryson stand up to the sacred efforts in any language); but most is real, down to Knox's decision on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Bible">a legally-mandatory bible in English</a>, but even more to the cultural capture of the nation’s Anglicised elites, but even more than that to the simple dictates of shared economic activity, over three hundred years: i.e. <i>we gave</i> English our sacred talk, then we gave English our intellectual talk, and then trade talk, and law talk, and all their formal accoutrements. Until only the informal and proletarian was left. Atweill, the kitsch prevails (“Hoots ma wee bonnie lassie! Ahiiii wid wauk fyv hhundrid myles”).  When Lorimer wrote this, the dialectisation of Scots, and the cutesy granny-aff-a-bus process wasn’t so advanced - but this is the register we moderns read it in, unless we are rural and lucky.<br/><br/>(Nasty but probable thing I once heard a linguist lecture on: relatively few languages develop the scientific-philosophical register and benefit from its sharpening vocabularies. He reckoned that only nine ever have, <i>fully</i>: Chinese, Arabic, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Russian, German, French, English. Scots definitely had speakers sophisticated enough, in its High Medieval heyday, but the internationalist use of Latin precluded it.)<br/><br/>Lorimer saw a Bible translation as one of two conditions of revitalising braid Scots - the language, rather than the dialect Scots English.

      <td><i>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</i> (2011) by David Graeber</td>
      <td>Exciting and well-written but unreliable and unfocussed. The main thesis is that debt isn't straightforward accounting: all systems of debt require a hidden moral assumption, which is that it's bad to be indebted, that debt overrules other moral claims like equity or even survival:<br/><blockquote><i>paying one’s debts is not the essence of morality, that all these things are human arrangements and that if democracy is to mean anything, it is the ability to all agree to arrange things in a different way.</i></blockquote><br/>To establish this he goes into an array of human economies: slaving, gift economies, Kula rings... but the brute fact of diverse institutions doesn't really connect with his moral thesis. <i>Then</i> this all goes towards his grand equating of the market and the state (so that people will resist both of them). <br/><br/>He argues that formal debt (of accountants and lawyers) causes poverty and violence relative to traditional informal debt (of cousins, dowries, and sheep). But this is wildly inconsistent with the last two hundred years of social development; poverty is a fraction of what it was, and violence (including state violence, including incarceration as violence) is also down.<br/><br/>He gets worked up about "the myth of barter", the largely silly idea that there was generally a transition from pure barter economies to money economies at some point in cultural history. Even if we grant this, his estimation of the significance of barter being rare is excessive. It doesn't have any clear moral bearing.<br/><br/>His debt Jubilee idea, coming as it did post-Recession, is superficially good, especially since giant financiers had just received trillions in bailouts. But if we made debt forgiveness a common concern, we'd just be redistributing money to those best at obtaining credit via excessive self-esteem, credentials or scamming. And post-Jubilee credit system would immediately dry up, or sting us with vast interest rates. They couldn't exist otherwise, and then homeowning and car purchase would again be only within reach for the rich.<br/><br/>There are dozens or more or less serious errors in it. (Still less unreliable than most anarchism and most cultural anthropology.) If you still want to read it, you really should take note of the huge errata others have helpfully contributed to Graeber, not that he'd thank them:<br/><br/>- <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2012/02/22/the-world-economy-is-not-a-tribute-system/">Henry Farrell</a><br/>- <a href="https://www.annleckie.com/2013/02/24/debt/">Ann Leckie</a><br/>- <a href="https://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2014/11/book-review-debt-first-5000-years.html">Noah Smith</a><br/>- <a href="https://codeandculture.wordpress.com/2011/12/29/how-the-poor-debtors/">Gabriel Rossman</a><br/>- <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2014/11/monday-smackdown-in-the-absence-of-high-quality-delong-smackdowns-back-to-david-graeber.html">Brad deLong</a><br/><br/><br/>This is 4/5 for style and ambition, provided you don't take any particular claim too seriously.

He uses the neologism "pseudospeciation" (i.e. the dehumanising kind of racism) about 50 times.<br/><br/>He is often thrillingly unimpressed:<br/><blockquote><i> Jane Goodall blew everyone's socks off by reporting the now-iconic fact that chimps make tools... Most cultural anthropologists weren't thrilled by Goodall's revolution, and now emphasise definitions that cut chimps and other hoi polloi out of the party.

For our purposes we'll rely on an intuitive definition of culture emphasised by Frans de Waal: culture is how we do and think about things.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>But he's way too credulous about social science.

I don't know enough about neuroscience or endocrinology or ethology to make a similar recommendation for the other chapters.

The Corsican freedom fighters, the mob, the fucked-up Jacobins, and the Thermidorians each broke France, creating a ladder of corpses for people like Boney. (This feat is repeated by psychos in most revolutions.) He made general at 26 through an unearned political appointment, and was given absolute command of 63,000 men soon after. <br/><br/>Dwyer is out to get Napoleon: he sees propaganda everywhere (even in Boney's private diary, aged 18). The whole book is obsessed with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism">Construction</a> of Napoleon - for instance, did you know that when he won a battle, <i>he told people about it expecting praise</i>?  This sentence, or its proposition, is repeated more than a hundred times:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    This encounter [with a prostitute] is taken by most historians at face value, but it is entirely possible that the account is fictional, nothing more than a fanciful exercise of the pen.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>    Of course it's possible, but so what? What is its probability? (I continue to read nonfiction which isn't data-driven - more fool me, I suppose.) It's weird to feel annoyed by the hypercritical spirit; I'm usually on the other side of this fence. <br/><br/>Dwyer is at least jargon-free. And Napoleon certainly lies all the time - to his rivals, his friends, and to posterity. An odd case: both genius and fraud - a genius of dishonesty. (Like Edison?)<br/><br/>Much of this long book is just a prose list of events, many of them insignificant (not to say prurient).

Fine as reference work maybe.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><i>Misc:</i> <br/><br/>* I knew that standing armies of the day were rammed full of pillagers, rapists, and thieves, but I was surprised to find that their generals were little better - Napoleon extracted about 80 million francs (maybe half a billion dollars?) from the Italians he conquered, under the name "requisitions". <br/>(This is many times the tax rate of the previous Austrian occupiers.)<br/><br/>* The many portraits of N are comically dissimilar - simply because done by artists who had never seen him or any image of him.   <br/><br/>* His romantic insecurity is also surprising: he writes to Josephine much more than she replies, and is constantly crestfallen to find her gone without saying where.<br/><br/>* "<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/">Jacobin</a>" is a terrible choice of name for a social justice magazine. It's more like "Khmer Rouge Weekly" or "the Daily Witchfinder" than anything laudable: <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=30EEq8R2feIC&pg=PA617&dq=40000+reign+of+terror&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSgYOtyongAhUkrXEKHUuUBZoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=40000&f=false">~40,000</a> executed or left to rot and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_the_Vend%C3%A9e">a hundred thousand in the Vendée</a>, mostly religious peasants, <i>as well as</i> atrocities like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drownings_at_Nantes">mass slow drownings</a>). The Jacobins deserve some share of Napoleon's millions of dead too - for all that N was only pretending to be a Jacobin. <br/><br/>Of course, the revolution nominally ended feudalism, redistributed land, and claimed to establish human rights. But we know in hindsight that this could have been done without killing 1% of the country and 0.6% of everyone alive - for instance, it was in Britain, and it was by earlier and later French republicans. So you got some nicer rhetoric in exchange for millions of gallons of blood.       <br/><br/>It suits me to call the Jacobins a perversion of the Enlightenment. This has <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/03/11/steven-pinkers-counter-counter-enlightenment/">lately been characterised</a> as a trick - if it's wrong for <i>Jacobin</i> to cherry-pick the bits they like about the Jacobins (anger, radicalisation, protest marches, beautiful lip-service to egalitarianism) then it's wrong for me to say they're not really part of 'the Enlightenment'. But it is a sick joke of history that Montesquieu's rage at torture, Condorcet's rational politics, and Bentham's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham#Gender_and_sexuality">impressive moral generosity</a> must share a name with these torturing and bigoted totalitarians.<br/><br/><a href="http://revueperiode.net/jacobin-magazine-entretien-avec-bhaskar-sunkara/">But why is <i>Jacobin</i> called <i>Jacobin</i>? </a><br/><blockquote><i><br/>In the United States, most people do not associate the term with a particular political group.

For the artistic director Remeike Forbes who was born in Jamaica, the term refers to the same book... "Bolshevik" would not be bad as a title in fact!

Now he worries that science is going to make life too easy – that overcoming human evolution’s horrible legacy issues (e.g. ubiquitous mental illness, moral myopia, unspeakable death) with biotechnology will amount to the death of the soul. (Where the soul is that which thrives on adversity, is real / spiritual / creative, and Takes Responsibility.) <br/><br/>I shouldn’t mock; Fukuyama at least handles this fear secularly and rationally, and his existential claim is not wrong by definition; also, it is interesting to him endorse regulation for once. This is a clear statement of a common (the default?) position on a matter of huge importance.<br/><br/>However, his arguments are piss-poor: he argues via 1) using fictional evidence – <i>Brave New World</i> and the <i>Bible</i>; by 2) suggesting, without real evidence, that there are insurmountable trade-offs between longevity and cognition, happiness and creativity, and personality and freedom; and by 3) a truly massive suppressed premise: that things are ok as they are (or, at least, as good as they get). <br/><br/>The first section, laying out 2002’s cutting edge in life extension, neuropharmacology, and genetic engineering, is fair and good. He accuses bioethicists of being gung-ho shills for Industry, which is interesting, but completely opposed to my experience of them as timid precautionists. <br/><br/>If you read it, read <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/dignity.html">Bostrom</a> too.</td>

      <td><i>The Establishment: And How They Get Away with It</i> (2014) by Owen   Jones</td>
      <td>Begins very well:<br/><blockquote><br/><i><br/>'The Establishment' is a term that is often loosely used to mean "people with power whom I object to".<br/></i></blockquote><br/>But this awareness didn't immunise him to self-service: instead of writing a book about just "the people with power", or "people who abuse their power", he focusses on one sort: the many cronies and neoliberals that cling to the country's upper reaches. The Jonesian Establishment consists of: fiscally conservative think tanks (but not powerful fiscally liberal ones); Old Boy MPs (but not originally working-class ones, however much they use the same revolving doors); the news media (but not himself, with <a href="https://twitter.com/OwenJones84?ref_data-src=twdata-src%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">500,000</a> followers); the police; all corporate bosses; anything to do with the City. <br/><br/>This is only a problem because of his choice of term, which implies that his description covers all the powerful in Britain. (A big omission, for instance, are the unions. Unite and Unison have extremely <a href="https://www.lgcplus.com/prime-minister-restores-tuc-meetings/1501606.article">frequent</a> meetings with the most powerful politicians in the country - quite rightly - and have an incredibly strong role in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/unite-union-boss-len-mccluskey-threatens-to-launch-party-to-rival-labour-9231266.html">selecting some of those people</a> - quite dubiously. They sometimes use this power against the public interest, e.g. GMB propping up Trident. But they are not Establishment to Jones.*) <br/><br/>He is thinking clearly, and that's half the work in finding the truth, which is half the work in changing the world. But, above the level of reporting individual events, he is just not empirically reliable: he notes that the <i>Sun</i> has 3m readers and just assumes that this means they are all-powerful in elections. Actually the (British, C21st) media has <a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/news/2015/april/newspapers-influence-election">little effect</a> on election outcomes - <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.570.64&rep=rep1&type=pdf">they produce only</a> <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~chri3110/Details/Sun%20paper.pdf">1-2% swings</a>.**<br/><br/>A more general problem: Jones has a fundamentally <i>moral</i> conception of society's problems: "the poor primarily suffer because of the greed or cowardice or ignorance of our rulers. Nationalisations and the £20 minimum wage would have no real downside." This is as opposed to the engineering conception, which sees the constraints, tradeoffs, and tries to design solutions with these in mind.<br/><br/>Still, my sympathies are with people who get attacked on both sides of a war, as Jones often does - for being both naively idealistic about economics and democracy, <i>and</i> insufficiently radical and obedient to the party line. He bears some millstones, like his totally unanalysed use of the Left/Right divide (he prefaces every single bloody interview with bloody anyone with a binary tag, one way or the other).<br/><br/>Anyway this is fine as very recent political history. (If you were paying attention to politics during the Noughties, then you maybe won't learn much new here, but it's a great primer for the foreign or young.) I was angry afterward, so clearly he is effective at his chosen task; god knows if political anger is what we need though. (I read a <i>lot</i> of non-data-driven nonfiction, god knows why. Maybe so my anger can be relevant at least, or in preparation for pseuds' dinner parties.) <br/><br/><br/><br/>* (I also wish he'd stop capitalising the damn word all the time.)<br/><br/>** A belief in the brain-washing power of the media - to change voting behaviour, to instil sexism, to desensitize us to violence - is one of the defining quirks of the modern hard left, despite there being decent counter-evidence against each effect. <i>Percipi est esse.</i><br/></td>

      <td>Has many of St Aubyn's distinctive virtues - acute black comedy about every social stratum, characters creatively misspending resources, the sometime delight of being exploited, actual knowledge of modern philosophy - but this time it doesn't gel.<br/><br/>The protagonist, Fairburn, writes a book with Patrick Melrose as a character - which invites us to identify Fairburn with St Aubyn. But it doesn't fit very well; Fairburn's life work is meaningless and saccharine. They are both troubled and self-destructive and possibly redeemed I suppose. <br/><br/>The enframed narrative with Patrick is annoying, and annoyingly this is intentional:<br/><blockquote><i>Yesterday Angelique came into the bedroom holding my thin manuscript. She moved towards the open window and I surged up from the pillows shouting, ‘Don’t!’<br/>‘Oh, don’t worry,’ she said, ‘I’m not going to throw it out of the window — that would be doing you a favour.’<br/>‘You don’t like it?’<br/>‘It’s wooden and dry and boring. I can’t believe this is what you want to do with your last days. Why don’t you write about how wonderful the figs taste when you know you may never taste one again?’<br/>‘Because they don’t,’ I said, ‘they taste like ash.’<br/>‘Why don’t you tell us how we must live every moment to the full because life is so precious?’<br/>‘Because if it’s dying that makes you realize that, you’re already too anxious to do anything about it. I wanted to do something serious…’<br/>‘You are doing something serious: you’re dying,’ she said, laughing.<br/>‘Something impersonal.’<br/>‘But that’s exactly the problem: you must make it more personal, more human, more dramatic. You should write from your own experience, write about us... I think the real problem is that you don’t know how to make abstract ideas exciting...’<br/>She left the room and, paralysed by failure and confusion, I watched the breeze scatter the pages across the floor.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>This is a good skewering of upper-middle-class / academic conceit:<br/><blockquote><i>The warden’s sly, pedantic chuckle seemed to reverberate among the bookshops and gargoyles that guarded the taxi rank; his gurgling complacencies soaked the golden buildings until they split open like soggy trifle. Perhaps they had once been intended for something serious, but there had been too many puns, too many Latin tags, too many acrostics, too many fiendish crossword puzzles, too many witty misquotations and too many sly chuckles for them to do anything but rot, however noble and solid they might look to the winking eye of a tourist’s camera.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Many, many different ideas about consciousness show up appear, from the zany (Penrose and Sheldrake) to the canonical (Colin McGinn and Galen Strawson). The stuff on Penrose and Sheldrake is accurate, in the weak sense that it describes their positions correctly. Sadly it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_mysterianism">mysterianism</a> that wins over Patrick / Charlie. The conclusion is roughly a celebration of the mere manifest image, quietism, Wittgenstein's gallic shrug. It manages to miss the point of scientific interest in consciousness, and underestimate the progress it's made already:<br/><blockquote><i> I saw the latest cluster of books to emerge from the great consciousness debate: Emotional Intelligence, The Feeling Brain, The Heart’s Reasons. I felt the giddy relief of knowing that I wasn’t going to read any of them. The fact that science has decided to include emotion in its majestic worldview seems about as astute as an astronomer discovering the moon.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Oh well. Plenty of cynical goodness besides. For instance, I have felt the following emotion, back when I didn't have the spine to refuse to go clubbing:<br/><blockquote><i>   I sat down on a velvet bench and through all the smoke and the bad music and the undesirable desire I suddenly allowed myself to become relaxed. Even here there was no need to posture. The essential question remained the same. Where could I find freedom in this situation? I looked around and felt reconciled with all the people in Alessandro's party and all the people in the room. I could spray adjectives at them for the rest of the evening, but in the end they were just people struggling to be happy with only the most unpromising material at their disposal.<br/></i></blockquote><br/></td>

Everyone’s always trying to educate everyone else, without invitation. <br/><br/>Tragic, panoptic, and treats big C21st problems – neocolonialism, quant finance, the ineffectiveness of NGOs, the nature of the transnational élite that administers all these things. But also dull, overwritten and clumsily polymathic (characters can be found over-reading, variously, Gödel, Middlemarch, the birth of Bangladesh, the Brit-pop band James). The book is aware of its own pomp – there’s a long discussion of sincerity as virtue and vice, a raging attack on Anglophone Indian literature, and Zafar quotes more and more as he disintegrates, suggesting that the book’s larding of quotations is a knowing prop. But while I don’t know whether it’s Zafar or Rahman that the book’s clumsiness is rooted in, I don’t have to, to know that his conceit of desperate knowledge didn’t take root in me. <br/><br/>I shouldn’t say panoptic: there’s only one woman in this, really, and we don’t see much even of her except as deceiver and appalling vehicle for privilege. Chapter 14’s good – a big bickering, drunken dinner with Pakistani elites, and there are details to admire throughout (Zafar broods over microaggressions, and some of his apercus are sparkling – like his characterisation of maths as “thinking without the encumbrance of knowledge”, or his likening of a good essay to “a good dress – long enough to cover the important bits, short enough to be interesting”). <br/><br/>Last, very superficially: there are no speech marks, and this deadens the dialogue for me; it makes everything look past-tense and snarky.

      <td>Exciting but not persuasive. It's an attempt to borrow the prestige and consensus of the Green movement to push through all the expensive social policies she wanted anyway. <br/><br/>That sounds cynical, but she says as much right at the start of the book: <br/><blockquote><i>I was propelled into a deeper engagement with [environmentalism] partly because I realized it could be a catalyst for forms of social and economic justice in which I already believed... liberals are still averting their eyes, having yet to grasp that climate science has handed them the most powerful argument against unfettered capitalism since William Blake's 'dark Satanic Mills'</i></blockquote><br/>Here's what I think the central argument is (she never comes out and says it):<br/><blockquote>Climate change is an existential risk.<br/>Capitalism exacerbates climate change.<br/>Therefore change capitalism.</blockquote><br/><br/>But the subtitle's misleading; she constantly blurs the distinction between two theses: 1) 'solving the climate crisis will require regulation of the market', and 2) 'solving the climate crisis will require the abolition of capitalism' In most of this she doesn't endorse (2) at all - "<i>there is plenty of room to make a profit in a zero-carbon economy</i>" - and surprisingly she doesn't deny that <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/armine-sahakyan/the-grim-pollution-pictur_b_9266764.html?guccounter=1">communism</a> <a href="https://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1990/09/ridgeway.html">was worse</a> for the environment than the C20th Western system: <br/><blockquote><i>...the truth is that, while contemporary, hyper-globalized capitalism has exacerbated the climate crisis, it did not create it. We started treating the atmosphere as our waste dump when we began using coal on a commercial scale in the late 1700s and engaged in similarly reckless ecological practices well before that. Moreover, humans have behaved in this shortsighted way not only under capitalist systems, but under systems that called themselves socialist as well...</i></blockquote><br/>If you read closely enough you see her actual target is not capitalism but '<i>extractivism</i>', the (ancient!) tendency of people to exploit natural resources relentlessly.<br/><br/>The cause of extractivism is fatuously said to be the philosophical divide between mind and body, whence also science and the industrial revolution. This causation is ascertained in one line, with a vague citation to unnamed feminist scholars having "recognised" (by which she means conclusively demonstrated) this at some point (pp.177).<br/><br/>She's really good at generating urgency and panic: she calls anything that doesn't cut all 10 petagrams of emissions <i>right away</i> a "failure". And since it's a failure, therefore confront and block and yell. (Needless to say, activism can't make all the cuts in time either.)<br/><br/>She has a chapter on each of the non-political solutions: so she is sequentially anti-nuclear, anti-GM, anti-geoengineering, anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading">cap</a>, anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax">tax</a>, anti-<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/13/richard-branson-failed-climate-change-pledge">Branson</a>, anti-'corporate reponsibility'.

And pricing is the best and least dangerous policy option.<br/><br/>In their stead she promotes "planning and banning" (vast micromanagement of allowed resources and technologies), divestment (which we know has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/17/why-fossil-fuel-divestment-is-a-misguided-tactic">no long-term</a> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-divestment-work">effect</a> on public companies) and blockading machinery (which sorta works but at terrible human cost). She also wants North America to be more northern European, with<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    cheap public transit and clean light rail accessible to all: affordable, energy-efficient housing along those transit lines; cities planned for high-density living; bike lanes in which riders aren’t asked to risk their lives to get to work; land management that discourages sprawl and encourages local, low-energy forms of agriculture; urban design that clusters essential services like schools and health care along transit routes and in pedestrian-friendly areas; programs that require manufacturers to be responsible for the electronic waste their produce...</i></blockquote><br/>That's most evocative of the Netherlands. But their infrastructure was not born of mass politics, green or otherwise, but rather of high energy costs and low land per capita. <a href="http://induecourse.ca/naomi-klein-this-changes-everything/">Joseph Heath explains</a> that this cost difference<br/><blockquote><i>creates the demand for transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly cities, just like the electricity price creates the demand for efficient housing. This is what drives the style of planning that predominates in that country. You can do all the “planning” of urban development you want, but unless people actually want to live in the high-density houses you’re building, they will remain empty. The reason they are attractive to people in the Netherlands is that the alternatives are unattractive, largely because of the cost.<br/><br/>Given the impact that prices have on behaviour throughout the economy, it is clear that the ability to control prices is by far the most powerful policy lever that the state has in its possession. Thus the natural upshot of a wish-list like the one Klein presents is that the state should start to price the carbon externality generated through fossil-fuel consumption, through either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax. And yet this is not what Klein recommends.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Anyway the market is decarbonising. I would say that we have the benefit of the three years of progress since she wrote this, but the (capitalist) trend was clear back then too: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-energy-consumption-by-region">17% renewables</a> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-energy-consumption-by-region">growth per year</a>.<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://rameznaam.com/2016/04/12/how-cheap-can-electric-vehicles-get/">Electric cars are now cheaper to run than fossil ones</a> and the price curve is tending quickly and strongly down.<a href="http://rameznaam.com/2015/08/10/how-cheap-can-solar-get-very-cheap-indeed/"> New-build solar power is now cheaper per megawatt than oil</a>, and the<a href="http://rameznaam.com/2015/10/14/how-cheap-can-energy-storage-get/"> associated storage cells</a> for night are becoming cheaper even faster. These are both market developments (boosted by subsidies but more and more self-sustaining).<br/><br/>She has a long section on how having a child was the cause of her environmentalism - but she fails to reconcile this with the fact that having a child in the developed world is the <a href="http://blogs.sps.ed.ac.uk/jwi/2017/09/20/if-having-children-is-bad-for-the-environment-what-should-parents-do-about-it/">single most</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378008001003">significant environmental footprint</a> for an individual; it would take an extraordinary amount of work to just zero out this harm.<br/><br/>As economics this is shaky, and as politics unlikely, but she remains a good journalist. Where by journalist I mean 'person who works at the “These terrible unknown things are happening; here is what the people involved say. What might it mean?” level'. She also writes at the "Here is the big picture and what to do about it" level though, and honestly I recommend just walking right by those bits (pages 1 through 300).<br/><br/>Minus a point because it falsely maligns effective and politically available environment policies, and so has done expected harm. <br/><br/>Read <a href="http://www.inference.org.uk/sustainable/book/tex/sewtha.pdf">Mackay</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/renewables">OWiD</a> instead.</td>

      <td><i>Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour</i> (2004) by Kate Fox</td>
      <td>Pretty funny, maybe the first bit of cultural anthropology I've liked (because it is low-level and in fact exasperatingly empirical). Here is her on her own tribe: <br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>the... currently fashionable practice  is  to devote at least a chapter of  your book or Ph.D. thesis to a tortured, self-flagellating disquisition on the ethical and methodological difficulties  of   participant  observation.  Although  the  whole  point  of   the  participant  element  is  to  understand  the  culture  from  a  ‘native’ perspective, you must spend a good three pages explaining that your unconscious  ethnocentric  prejudices,  and  various  other  cultural  barriers,  probably  make  this  impossible.  It  is  then  customary  to  question  the  entire  moral  basis  of   the  observation  element,  and,  ideally,  to  express  grave  reservations  about  the  validity  of   modern  Western  ‘science’  as  a  means  of   understanding  anything  at  all. <br/><br/>At  this  point,  the  uninitiated  reader  might  legitimately  wonder  why  we  continue  to  use  a  research  method  that  is  clearly  either  morally  questionable  or  unreliable  or  both.  I  wondered  this  myself,  until I realised that these doleful recitations of  the dangers and evils of   participant  observation  are  a  form  of   protective  mantra,  a  ritual  chant  similar  to  the  rather  charming  practice  of   some  Native  American tribes who, before setting out on a hunt or chopping down a  tree,  would  sing  apologetic  laments  to  appease  the  spirits  of   the  animals  they  were  about  to  kill  or  the  tree  they  were  about  to  fell.  <br/><br/>A  less  charitable  interpretation  would  see  anthropologists’  ritual  self-abasements  as  a  disingenuous  attempt  to  deflect  criticism  by  pre-emptive confession of  their failings – like the selfish and neglectful lover  who  says,  ‘Oh,  I’m  such  a  bastard,  I  don’t  know  why  you  put  up  with  me,’  relying  on  our  belief   that  such  awareness  and  candid acknowledgement  of   a  fault  is  almost  as  virtuous  as  not  having  it.  <br/><br/>But whatever the motives, conscious or otherwise, the ritual chapter agonising   over   the   role   of    the   participant   observer   tends   to   be mind-numbingly tedious...<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>    Even with a style like that, this gets repetitive. But her explicit decoding would be so, so helpful to incomers or neuroatypicals. She is particularly good on the subtle way that class is central in Britain (not "no oiks allowed" but rather "can he choose and pronounce the word 'toilet' ").<br/></td>

      <td><i>Frankensaurus</i>. Both very clumsy and ahead of its time. Crichton is often described as a one-legged stool: i.e. he has good ideas, but no prose or characters. Ian Malcolm, his sexy radfem primitivist chaos theorist is an exception, and if anything the film's (iconic) depiction of him is less striking and seductive than the sneering pole depicted here.<br/><br/>    It's worth picking on Malcolm because he's depicted as prescient, fundamentally correct about the island; he gets the most airtime by far, with the only pushback being Hammond saying "pish posh!" every so often - (Unless you count the raptor attacking him as a discursive act); he is even given the chapter header pages to be oracular on, slowly drawing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve">dragon curve</a> as if it meant anything. And his philosophy, endorsed by Crichton, is tepid and dismaying finger-wagging.<br/><br/><img data-src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-D527GAe-TTM/WreCWKqIe3I/AAAAAAAAEVM/t5-78cVtGpUDVWHar5RY5CL2rgpai2skACLcBGAs/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2018-03-25%2B12-00-44.png" /><br/><br/>So: He denies that modern life is better than premodern life and endorses Sahlins' lazy-bushman hypothesis: <br/><blockquote><i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ‘What advances?’ Malcolm said irritably. 'The number of hours women devote to housework has not changed since 1930, despite all the advances. All the vacuum cleaners, washer-dryers, trash compactors, garbage disposals, wash-and-wear fabrics... Why does it still take as long to clean the house as it did in 1930?’<br/>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie said nothing.<br/>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because there haven’t been any advances,’ Malcolm said. 'Not really. Thirty thousand years ago, when men were doing cave paintings at Lascaux, they worked twenty hours a week to provide themselves with food and shelter and clothing. The rest of the time, they could play, or sleep, or do whatever they wanted. And they lived in a natural world, with clean air, clean water, beautiful trees and sunsets. Think about it. Twenty hours a week. Thirty thousand years ago.’<br/></i></blockquote><br/>The first claim is flatly false: average housework by US women <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w13985.pdf">decreased by about 14 hours(!) a week</a> over this period. (Table 6, last column.) This is despite ballooning house sizes, inventory of objects to maintain, and time actually spent with the children. It also omits our greatly increased levels of hygiene and personal fragrance, though I suppose that could be zero-sum if we habituate to it.<br/><br/>The second is false but not as flatly. I can't find anyone speculating "twenty hours" about the economy of the Upper Paleolithic French. If Crichton is merely mashing up the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_affluent_society">Bushman studies</a> with the punchy image of Lascaux, then despite celebrated dissemination by anthropologists, the claim is untrue: contemporary African hunter-gatherers spend <a href="http://www.rachellaudan.com/2016/01/was-the-agricultural-revolution-a-terrible-mistake.html">more than 50 hours a week on food production</a>. Worse, Malcolm's smug rant puts zero weight on the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/life_history/aging_evolution/hill_2007_hiwi_mortality.html">giant disease burden</a>, the constant warfare, the giant boredom, the crushing conformity and illiberty of nomad life, and the perfect absence of intellectual life among the ancients.<br/><br/>(Judging by the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3654">hostility of Pinker's reviewers</a>, Ian Malcolm is still with us, railing against e.g. consumerism and overpopulation - as if those weren't people just trying to live their lives - and reductionism, denying or minimising the huge material and spiritual gains of science and other blessed modernities.)<br/><br/>More: Malcolm is himself wildly overconfident about modelling, e.g. the fit of basic fractal theory to the park disaster; Crichton is credulous about the almost-completely unfulfilled promises of the wild-eyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute">Santa Fe</a> set. <blockquote><i><br/>They believed that prediction was just a function of keeping track of things. If you knew enough, you could predict anything<br/></i></blockquote> The latter claim is true for all phenomena except pure random number generators though; the untrue version Crichton means depends on ignorantly thinking that "predict" always (or ever) means "predict with certainty".<br/><br/>Crichton was a programmer, and there's a nice wee code listing in a critical moment, in a made up language resembling <a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/135417/what-can-we-infer-about-the-programming-language-used-in-jurassic-park-the-bo">Perl + Forth + COBOL</a>.

Some very lovely passages throughout too:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>The bowed head, the buried face. She is silent, she will never speak, never forgive, never reach a hand, never leave this frozen present tense. All waits, suspended. Suspended the autumn trees, the autumn sky, anonymous people. A blackbird, poor fool, sings out of season from the willows by the lake. A flight of pigeons over the houses; fragments of freedom, hazard, an anagram made flesh. And somewhere the stinging smell of burning leaves.</i></blockquote><br/>The ending, so easily hated, does not strike me as meaning "to win love eternal, go on just hit her in the face", despite appearances. It is rather a parting stab at your opinion of Nicholas, a big Straussian dischord thrown into the supposed perfect cadence of the godgame people's efforts; Lily's grand second commandment dissolves suddenly, saltily, and then: a warm mist descends.

We need such things; otherwise those of us without internal wellsprings of meaning will find it boring, and will thus never excel; otherwise a culture will never grow, and nothing human lasts without growing a culture.

Yes: that is the main tax we pay to be on the internet. I think of Yudkowsky as George Eliot thinks of Carlyle (though she hated him btw):<br/><blockquote><blockquote><i><br/>...the highest aim in education is analogous to the highest aim in mathematics, namely, to obtain not results but powers, not particular solutions, but the means by which endless solutions may be wrought. He is the most effective educator who aims less at perfecting specific acquirements than at producing that mental condition which renders acquirements easy, and leads to their useful application...<br/><br/>On the same ground it may be said that the most effective writer is... he who rouses in others the activities that must issue in discovery, who awakes men from their indifference to the right and the wrong, who nerves their energies to seek for the truth and live up to it at whatever cost... he clears away the film from your eyes that you may search for data to some purpose. He does not, perhaps, convince you, but he strikes you, undeceives you, animates you. You are not directly fed by his books, but you are braced as by a walk up to an alpine summit, and yet subdued to calm and reverence as by the sublime things to be seen from that summit.  Such a writer is Thomas Carlyle. <br/><br/>It is an idle question to ask whether his books will be read a century hence: if they were all burnt as the grandest of Suttees on his funeral pile, it would be only like cutting down an oak after its acorns have sown a forest. For there is hardly a superior or active mind of this generation that has not been modified by Carlyle’s writings; there has hardly been an English book written for the last ten or twelve years that would not have been different if Carlyle had not lived... The extent of his influence may be best seen in the fact that ideas which were startling novelties when he first wrote them are now become common-places. And we think few men will be found to say that this influence on the whole has not been for good... </blockquote></i></blockquote><br/>(Who didn't start the fire...)<br/><br/>[<a href="http://thecodelesscode.com/case/27">Free here</a>]<br/>[<a href="https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/">Thinking #3, Theory #2</a>]<br/></td>

To fulfil their high function they work with the cunning of the head. But to leave destiny to the head is to leave the trigger to the finger. And after the trigger is pulled they cry above the desolation – (and the desolation was terrible to behold): ‘We will make a new earth, and share the fruits thereof and the fishes of the deeps.’ But what happens?<br/><br/>The fruit is processed and the salmon is canned.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>A good children’s book: pure of heart and finely weighted.

Nearer us in time and space than his Kovacs novels (this isn’t interstellar) – but they’ve still all forgotten us, bar the historians. Morgan lets genetic determinism run away with the plot: everyone’s always explaining themselves with reference to their or others’ “wiring”. At one point the protagonist hears a similarity in two people’s diction and “wondered idly what genes the two men might share”. Also his theme, ‘GM humans as future Other’ gets ponderous inbetween the ultraviolence. But Morgan is always worthwhile: his books suspend the ideological alongside the unhappily sexual alongside big strange guns (e.g. an AIDS pistol, loaded with GM virus ‘Falwell’). More mature in some ways – there’s a feminist imam, and a religious character he doesn’t have violent contempt for – but also a bit busy and contralto. <br/><br/>Stross and Morgan refer to ‘black labs’ a lot – that is, dastardly underground geneticists. Every single time they did, I wondered what the authors had against Labradors. Sort it out.<br/></td>

Richie has an eC20th directness about describing other peoples - think Martha Gellhorn or Kipling - their 'pure skin', their atrocity-enabling 'innocence', their circuitousness and tribalism. (It is now sometimes inappropriate, sometimes oppressive to emphasise differences so.) <br/><blockquote><i>I cannot imagine Plato thriving here [Japan], with all his absolutes (“the truth,” “the beauty”)... Maybe that is why Japan is so backward (by comparison) in some areas: philosophy, diagnosis. And perhaps why it is so forward in others.<br/><br/>From the celebrated farting-contest scroll and the early illustrated </i>He Gassen (The Fart Battle)<i>, up to such recent representations as the delightful farting games in Ozu Yazujiro's </i>Ohayo<i>, Japan's culture is filled with vivid examples... Farting is certainly included in the nature of man:<br/><blockquote><br/>"And what is it you all<br/>Are laughing at, may I ask?"<br/>The retired master's fart.<br/><br/>Four or five people<br/>Inconvenienced<br/>By the horse farting<br/>The long ferry ride.<br/></blockquote><br/>Just here, I think, is the difference in attitude between Japan and the West. That a thing </i>is<i> is sufficient to warrant its notice, even celebration. The hypocrisy of the idealistic has not until recently infected Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp:In both cultures the fart is funny but only in Japan is its humanity acknowledged. This entails a full acceptance of the human state. There is even a rubric for such matters, the </i>ningen-kusai<i> ("smelling of humanity") and within it the hé (屁) takes an honorable place.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i><br/>What do I want to be when I grow up? An attractive role would be that of the </i>bunjin<i>. He is the Japanese scholar who wrote and painted in the Chinese style, a literatus, something of a poetaster - a pose popular in the 18th century. I, however, would be a later version, someone out of the end of the Meiji, who would pen elegant prose and work up flower arrangements from dried grasses and then encourage spiders to make webs and render it all natural. For him, art is a moral force and he cannot imagine life without it. He is also the kind of casual artist who, after a day's work is done, descends into his pleasure park and dallies.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>Similar to Hitchens in its consistent, adventurous aestheticism, though with much quieter prose; however, neither has that certain Alastair Reid transcendence. Minus a half for seriously ugly layout and typography, but I will seek out his real books.<br/><br/><i>In one sentence</i>: Ah, so innocent, so subtle, so far from Ohio.<br/></td>

I didn't like the constant stream of cheap gags or his wielding family details for padding.

I have to adjust my brain to this.</i><br/>...<br/><br/><i>When I first read the parable of the prodigal son, I was perplexed. I felt terrible for the older brother. The poor man put in all these years of loyal service, and his brother skips town, has a wild good time, then returns, and gets a huge feast?

If you're looking at life as a balance sheet.<br/>There's a beauty to forgiveness, especially forgiveness that goes beyond rationality. Unconditional love is an illogical notion, but such a great and powerful one.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>(That simply strikes me as choosing to be mistaken and then hardening oneself to injustice.) <br/><br/><br/>He is not quite sophisticated enough to pull off rigorous naturalist wonder fully (but again this is me cruelly comparing a journalist to Nietzsche, Pessoa, Gopnik). But the following affirmation of mythos here is more or less my view:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>I'm still agnostic. But in the words of Elton Richards, I'm now a reverant agnostic. Which isn't an oxymoron, I swear. I now believe that whether or not there's a God, there is such a thing as sacredness. Life is sacred. The Sabbath can be a sacred day. Prayer can be a sacred ritual. There is something transcendent, beyond the everyday. It's possible that humans created this sacredness ourselves, but that doesn't take away from its power or importance.</i> <br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>Literalism is impossible, immoral and inconsistent with our new, better picture of the world; biblical liberalism is mercenary and inconsistent with itself. So don't bother?<br/></td>

(Note, however, that this isn't really a book: it's a transcript of Chomsky in discussion with someone with even less ideological care than he. Also, the title is cool but misleading, since they don't actually go in to the plausible claim that the West's foreign policy has been terroristic, and since I don't think drones come up at all.) It is selective as history and nearly worthless as economics, but I do not begrudge Chomsky continuing his fifty-year marathon of talking about covert realpolitik: these sorts of manipulations are almost unreported at the time, go wholly unpunished, and are rapidly forgotten. <br/><br/>Like what?

In one breath they move from a righteous skit on the original colonial genocides to a view of world politics in which <i>everything</i> that happens now is the outcome of decisions in Brussels and Washington. From “The West has, historically and recently, been hypocritically violent and anti-democratic” to “Everything bad in the world is due to the West”. That sounds like a sure straw man, but here’s the man himself:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>The great majority of events that were causing the suffering of countless human beings all over the world were related to greed, to the desire to rule and to control coming almost exclusively from the ‘old continent’ and its powerful but ruthless offspring on the other shore.</i></blockquote> (Oh? malaria? dysentery? precarious subsistence farming? Hutu-on-Tutsi genocide?) He’s at it again here: <br/><blockquote><i>although it is mostly Rwanda, Uganda who are murdering millions of innocent [Congolese] people, behind this are always Western geopolitical and economic interests.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Well. It's true that, as well as the flat-out murders in the links above, our governments bear shame for ignoring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_war">unbelievably destructive</a> ongoing wars in e.g. the Congo. But failing to prevent murder is not murder, nor necessarily accessory to - especially if we remember that C&V’s judicious attitude to military intervention would have precluded direct action anyway. There is a logical chasm between what one could only <i>perhaps</i> prevent - given enough luck and blood - and what one is the cause of. (I agree that the two situations place similar responsibilities on us, by the way - but in the absence of simple solutions, that hypothetical responsibility does not make them the same.) Similarly: capitalism produces enormous inequality but <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2011$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=0AkBd6lyS3EmpdHo5S0J6ekhVOF9QaVhod05QSGV4T3c;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL%5Fn5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=194;dataMax=96846$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=55;dataMax=108111$map_s;sma=50;smi=2$cd;bd=0$inds=">mostly inadvertently relieves poverty</a>: poverty is our default from before there <i>was</i> a world-system. But C&V and others of the demagogic school persist in blaming all the world's ills on rich bores whose uncaring exploitation often works better for the poor than altruistic direct action. (This is very counterintuitive; so much for intuition.)<br/><br/>Why do I disagree? They say it’s cos I’m a dupe: <br/><blockquote><i>There have been very sophisticated propaganda systems developed in the last hundred years and they colonized minds including the minds of the perpetrators. That’s why the intellectual classes in the West generally can’t see it.</i></blockquote> <br/>I say it’s because while their description of our foreign policy is (depressingly) fair, on the foreign policy of rival governments they are uncritical, whitewashing, and on historical alternatives to our type of society they are naive and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_(fallacy)">cherry-picking</a>, where they give evidence at all. What might a real radical say in response to my aspersions? "Fuck balance! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ">Balance</a> is what lets them get away with it! Fuck evidence! Evidence is what makes people think I’m wrong!" <br/><br/>Vltchek is much more skewed than Chomsky. He’s earnest, and clearly devoted to <a href="http://andrevltchek.weebly.com/films.html">first-hand reporting</a> of the abuse of powerless people. But, oddly, depressingly, this immersion in the frontline has robbed him of perspective (and in fact it doesn't get more front-line: he was tortured in East Timor in 1996). He suffers the defining mistake of recent leftism: the enemy of my enemy error, where  you'll approve of anyone who resists the West. In fact, his comments, taken over the whole book, amount to a flirting defence of totalitarianism - he romanticises the Soviets, Assad's Syria, and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report-%5Bscheduler-publish-yyyy%5D/world-report-2014-ecuador">Ecuador</a>. Both of them exchange the Eurocentric rose-tint of our mainstream for lenses warped in the reverse direction. And it all rests, ultimately, on tacit belief in the <a href="http://tomtalkspolitics.wordpress.com/2009/12/07/bertrand-russells-the-superior-virtue-of-the-oppressed/">'superior virtue of the oppressed</a>' - the strange belief that being bombed makes the bomb recipient better than you. (Sure, they’re probably more virtuous than the bombers, but that’s not saying much.) Our governments being awful does not mean that others are not. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization">Quite the reverse</a>.<br/><br/>Also: Chomsky bashes the 'Black Book' of Communism not by challenging its accounting, but by saying that Western capitalism's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque">toll was worse</a> (no footnote, but see the lone India example below); and the Prague Spring is utterly minimised with the same ugly break-a-few-eggs fallacy. Vltchek: <br/><blockquote><i>Moscow’s invasion of 1968 to put down the Prague Spring was not necessarily something that should have happened... but there was no massacre performed by the Soviets; few people fell under the tanks. Most of what happened was accidents; some people who died were drunk.</i> </blockquote><br/>(The direct death toll was 72 plus suicides, if that's what he means.) <br/><br/>That’s the first big problem. The other huge one is the <i>complete</i> lack of footnotes, even as they make the boldest possible claims. As a result, even I identified some errors in the course of my single superficial reading. (Ok, so some failings are just the vagaries of live dialogue as compared to writing; but Vltchek (or Pluto Press at least) would be forgiven for editing the damn thing for basic evidence.)<br/><br/>The only research cited in support of the claim that capitalism causes more excess death from starvation is Dreze and Sen's reputable 1981 study 'Hunger and Public Action (<a href="http://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/faculty/glasgow/ps15/DrezeSen.pdf">p.214 here</a>). C&V use this to compare excess deaths in India (as an instance of a market democracy) in 1947-1979 with that of Communist China, pointing out that Dreze and Sen place the toll in India at some <i>100</i> million, next to China’s '25-30' million. (First cockup: citing thirty-year-old research underestimates the toll of Mao’s famine by perhaps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao's_Great_Famine#Criticism">20m people</a>.) But the comparison doesn't do the work they put it to (that is, condemning capitalism): India was almost an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarkic">autarkic</a> <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS022.pdf&rct=j&frm=1&q=&edata-src=s&sa=U&ei=CjO8U875JIjsOoKzgMAB&ved=0CBQQFjAA&sig2=jPPsJmQt057fqArKrMJ3kg&usg=AFQjCNGPlxtds0U9r_FEXHEoKaHEaeiSuA">command economy</a> (in which perhaps two-thirds of all formal, non-subsistence employment was public-sector) in that period; it does not serve them as an exemplar of neoliberal starvation. <br/><br/>Even if it did, we would again come up against their curious equation of <i>failure to prevent an intractable thing</i> with causing the thing in the first place. As far as I can tell, their reasoning really is: “Capitalism exists, and poverty exists, so, capitalism causes poverty.” But it would take one of two things for capitalism to be responsible for poverty: causation, as evidenced by e.g. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/06/economist-explains-0">a gross increase</a> in the number of poor people under its penumbra; or its impeding a more effective solution to poverty. But the proportion of (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty#Absolute_poverty">utterly</a>) poor people, in this supremely Late-capitalist world is the lowest it has ever been; and the remaining poverty is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_Billion">not at all simple to fix</a>; and capitalist countries really did try, throwing <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/23/aid_amnesia">enormous amounts of money and thought</a> at the problem for going-on 70 years. <br/><br/>To be responsible for poverty in the way C&V say, either capitalism or old socialism would have to be omnipotent, and - among other fairly strong disconfirmations for that idea - the 20th century shows both of those to be untrue. (The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Chomsky-book-a-best-seller-after-Chavez-speech-2469244.php">commercial success</a> of Chomsky in his enormously capitalist society, is an extra data point toward rubbishing any strong statement about capitalism's mind-control powers.)<br/><br/>(Vltchek talks about global warming briefly, and I was about to reach for the <a href="http://www.rtcc.org/2012/03/12/kiribati-president-rejects-climate-change-evacuation-stories/">recent debunking</a> of claims of Polynesian evacuation – but in fact it turns out his sources were better; the president of Kiribati has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/01/kiribati-climate-change-fiji-vanua-levu">since publicly floated</a> a national evac plan.)<br/><br/>A less straightforward quibble: they think this book is about the West, I think it’s about humans with power.<br/><br/>I had believed Chomsky more humane than this talk makes him seem (see for example his <a href="http://www.spectrezine.org/global/chomsky.htm">sombre 90s piece</a> on the Black Book) - that is, I want to pin the blame for this biased and maudlin tract on Vltchek. But <a href="http://www.monbiot.com/2012/05/21/see-no-evil/">his long-standing dismissal</a> of some non-Western massacres at last makes me wonder.<br/><br/>On a less uninspired and dispiriting note: if there is a system less bad than Swedish capitalism, it does not exist in the past. So it must be invented, negotiated, and tested. Chomsky and the other socially enraged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostalgie">ostalgiacs</a> in his ambit are not mostly doing that; <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2013/03/22/on-erik-olin-wrights-envisioning-real-utopias-diane-coyle/">Erik Olin Wright</a> and <a href="http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/a-practical-utopians-guide-to-the-coming-collapse">David Graber</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/feminism-capitalist-handmaiden-neoliberal">Nancy Fraser</a> and others are at least trying.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>Finally, what’s so bad about being excessive and dogmatic in your criticism of awful things? (Why should anti-oppression efforts need to justify themselves? They're anti-oppression!) Well, apart from it being dangerous and ignoble to be so firmly wrong, taking this tack means that your true conclusions will be dismissed as just more of your typical excesses. <br/><br/>But even given their slips, hyperbole, and complacency, there’s no way around <i>some</i> of C&V's key claims: Our governments have not in general been a positive force in the rest of the world; this is not well-known within our societies; as long as <a href="https://www.globalpolicy.org/us-un-and-international-law-8-24/us-opposition-to-the-icc-8-29.html">the US is</a> <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/490/united-states-and-the-icc">legally immune</a> from prosecution, international justice is a joke; we have often given money and guns to the worst people in the world; we did this for little more than control and for stuff.</td>

Better, you might view the act of worship as in fact degrading to the worshipper, or see the epistemology implicit in religious practice as an unhealthy and obstructive stance to the world. (Preventing as it does healing doubt and energetic inquiry; outmoded as it is given the better methods at hand.) <br/><br/>Anyway: Hick of the rearguard talks fairly and at length with a fictional scientistic interlocutor, demonstrating how - if the theist is willing to retreat, ad-hoc, about ten times - scientism actually cannot touch them. <br/><br/>Amusing example: Hick responds to the solid neurological explanation of religious experience by saying that this is all perfectly consistent with electrical induction in the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/brains/2007/04/spirit_tech.html">right angular gyrus</a> just <i>enabling us to perceive the spiritual world</i>.

That is, anthropology conducted by the opposite side of a total war, for predictive military purposes of the highest consequence. She was of course robbed of the moral superiority of field work by an ocean and a bunch of tanks and whatnot, so this is all based on expat interviews and extremely secondary sources. I'm still struggling to overcome my deep suspicion of cultural anthropology; thus I was actively drawn to Benedict by <a href="http://apjjf.org/-C.-Douglas-Lummis/2474/article.html">this hatchet job</a>, by a modern relativist anthropologist. <br/><br/>Sadly the book's only ok, very nicely written but falsely general. She introduces the key terms of the toxic wartime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido:_The_Soul_of_Japan">Inazo</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonn%C5%8D_j%C5%8Di">Satsuma</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statism_in_Sh%C5%8Dwa_Japan">Shówa</a> ideology, but mislabels this particular modernist system as "the Japanese worldview". Even so, in the one truly essential passage, Benedict lays out (and later tries to ameliorate) a popular reified caricature of the Japanese: as morbid, conformist, and paradoxical:<br/><blockquote><i>the Japanese have been described in the most fantastic series of ‘...but also's’ ever used for any nation of the world.  When a serious observer is writing about peoples other than the Japanese and says they are unprecedentedly polite, he is not likely to add, ‘But also insolent and overbearing.’ When he says people of some nation are incomparably rigid in their behaviour, he does not add, 'But they also adapt themselves readily to extreme innovations'. When he says a people are submissive, he does not explain too that they are not easily amenable to control from above... When he says they act mostly out of concern for others' opinions, he does not then go on to tell that they have a truly terrifying conscience...<br/><br/>When he writes a book on a nation with a popular cult of aestheticism which gives high honor to actors and to artists and lavishes art upon the cultivation of chrysanthemums, that book does not ordinarily have to be supplemented by another which is devoted to the cult of the sword and the top prestige of the warrior... All these contradictions, however, are the warp and woof of books on Japan.  They are true.  Both the sword and the chrysanthemum are a part of the picture.  The Japanese are to the highest degree, both aggressive and unaggressive, both militaristic and aesthetic, both insolent and polite, rigid and adaptable, submissive and resentful of being pushed around, loyal and treacherous, brave and timid, conservative and hospitable to new ways.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>People say she made this worse, but you can't claim that she didn't know something was up with the Western concepts used. There's an intriguing suggestion that the book is actually a satire (Geertz: "<i>The Chrysanthemum and the Sword is no more a prettied-up science-without-tears policy tract than [Gulliver's Travels] is a children's book.</i>"). But she actually was attached to military intelligence at the time and actually interviewed Japanese-American internees, and I find I don't much care either way.<br/><br/><br/><i>In one sentence</i>: The above long passage with a question mark on it.<br/></td>

      <td><i>Why Your Five-Year-Old Could Not Have Done That: Modern Art Explained</i> (2012) by Susie Hodge</td>
      <td>An attempted defence of the current reigning artistic paradigm: low-skill, high-concept, contemptuous of past, audience, and self; identitarian. Call it <i>anaesthetic conceptualism</i>. It is also a nice illustrated catalogue of some recent objects that have managed to piss various people off. 150 years ago, we direly needed people to make art larger, to stand against the Academic approach of Nice Hard Mimesis Only. The problem is that since the 50s many artists replaced that shallow spectacle of mere mimetic skill with the even shallower spectacle of empty originality and flashy cynicism. This book has <i>such</i> a patronising presentation; it could have been named "How to explain conceptualism to your five year-old". (I guess that could have been an intentional irony, but to me it just told me what she thinks of anyone sceptical of the trend. But some kudos for being clear, since this makes the hollowness of her points blatant.)<br/><br/>I have to applaud her; unlike the rest of her curator peers, she has at least <i>attempted</i> to justify a gigantically expensive, creativity-draining, status-hogging practice with close readings. I should also thank her for tacitly admitting that the only hermeneutics that can justify anaesthetic conceptualism is a small-minded and super-conservative intentionalism (i.e. 'what matters about the work is what the artist meant').* "It doesn't really matter how the object looks; what really matters is how deep the creator was and how much history you can project on it." But this philosophy of art is convincing to no-one not already invested in the great tedious playground. I dislike most of this art, and this way of talking about it, because I want to love art.***<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a useful catalogue of the kind of low-skill pieces that have only recently been possible and that you need to know about to move in certain presumably unbearable circles.<br/><br/><br><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>* Though the so-called <a href="http://faculty.smu.edu/nschwart/seminar/fallacy.htm">intentional fallacy</a> is not actually a fallacy** - it does not make sense to say that someone is <i>literally mistaken</i> to think that the creator's view of an artwork is the only relevant one, since aesthetic interpretation doesn't admit of literal error - instead it's just an incredibly limited and superstitious philosophy - along the same lines as deontology in ethics. It makes art a small and mostly ancient thing, while aesthetic experience could instead rise to each of the potential billions of minds that come to it, and it always takes place in the present, with entirely novel meanings generated, far beyond the ken of any creator.<br/><br/><br/>** I'm aware that 'fallacy' has found usage outside of its original meaning, 'a failure in logical reasoning'. But the new usage, committed for instance by Beardsley, is something shitey like 'a horrible belief I don't like boo'. I'm generally torn between a descriptive and a prescriptive philosophy of vocabulary, but in this case the bullying and sloppy-mindedness of the new usage makes me deny it outright. Some words are too important to give up. (Mostly epistemology tbf.)<br/><br/>*** This is an unforgivably poncey thing to say, not least because I don't think I really mean it. If crap artists had not usurped a good portion of all the species' attention and reverence, I don't think I'd care what modern art was like. But as it is they are cheaters - even the great ones. They cheat themselves into immortality and perceived profundity via the handy expedient of prettiness and vagueness or ugliness and vagueness. In a way, they and we cheat malaria victims of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/July_2015_United_Kingdom_budget#/Spending">huge sums</a>, while the very people who claim to care about global injustices cheer us dumping more money into it, while saying things like 'life isn't worth living without art'.

      <td><br/>Does Expressionism <i>do</i> anything but look cool and foil the old School of Paris? <br/><br/>I’m a slave to content, so I resent the mindless haste and vitiating freedom of Pollock and Co’s anti-painting, born of the macho belief in chaos (cf. Hunter Thompson, Jim Morrison, Debord). But Pollock’s not empty nor, really, chaotic. Apart from anything else, he makes Picasso look smooth and Mannered, a useful service. Apart from anything else, nothing made or viewed by humans can be non-representational. I like <i>Full Fathom Five</i> & <i>The Deep</i> (1953).</td>

      <td><i>Celebrity Culture</i> (2006) by Ellis Cashmore</td>
      <td>Kinda lightweight sociology. Picked it because it asks the right questions in its Contents table (“<i>What part did consumer society play in making us dote on celebrities? When did the paparazzi appear and how do they pedestalise and destroy people? How are cosmetic surgery and the preoccupation with physical perfection linked to celebrity culture? Why have black celebrities been used as living proof of the end of racism? How have disgrace and sexual indignity helped some celebrities climb onto the A-list?</i>”). <br/><br/>But while chatty, he’s critical in an uncritical way, high on anecdote, low on data - and there are <i>no</i> citations. Cashmore’s answers are thus suspect, trendy. The big contrarian move in sociology is to view fans as active & canny manipulators of the ‘culture’ but I don't care either way.</td>

      <td><i>My Shit Life So Far</i> (2009) by Frankie Boyle</td>
      <td>He is more than he’d have us think he is – but that isn’t saying much, since his core gag is wanking over inappropriate objects and taunting the weak. Book is tolerable when he’s busy liking things – Chomsky’s politics, Grant Morrison’s comics, Moorcock, old Clydeside socialism – and hating on the powerful (his portrayal of the civil service is great fun). <br/><br/>Includes a cursory rant against PC, a phenomenon he bizarrely (satirically?) blames on the <i>Mail</i>. Humane islands in an insincere sea. <br/><br/>On marriage: “<i>Fuck it, I tried”; “we struggled along like badly set bones</i>”. Makes Gill look like Tolstoy. Higher humour’s about laughing at yourself.</td>

      <td><i>The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google</i> (2017) by Scott Galloway</td>
      <td>Not the book I thought it was: I wanted searching political / macroeconomic expose of the costs of monopoly, but this is shallow and glib work on a topic of great importance. Galloway's a marketing professor / entrepreneur, and so this is a weird mix of polemical and fawning. (OK, I should've guessed its genre from the thoughtless use of institutional "DNA" in the subtitle.) There's basically no politics in this: it's a primer for worried and pious businessmen more than consumers or citizens or engineers. It also uses "relevant" unironically as a quantity of ultimate importance ("<i>Google had a market cap that topped $200 billion. But the Times was enormously relevant</i>".<br/><br/>I enjoyed this <br/><blockquote><br/>  [education], the cartel that masquerades as a social good but is really a caste system<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>and this (though his counterproposal wouldn't change much either):<br/><blockquote><br/>It is conventional wisdom that Steve Jobs put 'a dent in the universe.' No, he didn’t. Steve Jobs, in my view, spat on the universe. People who get up every morning, get their kids dressed, get them to school, and have an irrational passion for their kids’ well-being, dent the universe. The world needs more homes with engaged parents, not a better fucking phone.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>He presents himself as a critical outsider, and a moralist, but in between his rants he is scarcely less fawning about a set of overpriced electronics: <br/><blockquote><br/>In those ten years, Apple introduced one earth-shaking, 100-billion-dollar, categorycreating new product or service after another. The iPod, iTunes/Apple Store, iPhone, and iPad ... there has never been anything like it.<br/><br/>The iPod's introduction, in late 2001 after the twin shocks of the bursting of the dot-com bubble and 9/11, played the same role as the Beatles' appearance on Ed Sullivan just months after the Kennedy assassination: it was a bright light in the darkness that signaled hope and optimism. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And often his barbs are just glib. His full argument against Bezos' support for basic income:<br/><blockquote><br/>What's clear is that we need business leaders who envision and enact a future with more jobs — not billionaires who want the government to fund, with taxes they avoid, social programs for people to sit on their couches and watch Netflix all day. Jeff, show some real fucking vision.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>Besides the hollowness, there are dozens of minor errors or infelicities:<br/><blockquote><br/>  Luxury is not an externality; it's in our genes. It combines our instinctive need to transcend the human condition and feel closer to divine perfection, with our desire to be more attractive to potential mates. <br/></blockquote><br/>(That's not what "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externality</a>" means.)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Because media companies only get a mildly insane valuation, and the Four are addicted to iconospheric valuations — hundreds of billions. <br/></blockquote><br/>("Ionospheric" rather)<br/><blockquote><br/>   When Nietzsche proclaimed God is dead, it wasn't a victory cry but a lamentation on the loss of moral compass.<br/></blockquote><br/>(1) "compass" makes for a really poor adjective, please don't do that; 2) that's a ludicrous reading, though less silly than the usual macho triumph one.)<br/><blockquote><br/>  The effectiveness of prayer, the additional scrutiny determined, remains a matter of opinion.<br/></blockquote><br/>(Sure, for a pejorative sense of "opinion".)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  [big data] signals the end of sampling and statistics - now you can just track the shopping pattern of every customer in every one of your stores<br/></blockquote><br/>(1) this is the "n=all" dogma and, though very popular among people with bridges to sell, it is just not true - because no one ever has the full data set, because even if they did have a synchronous snapshot then we'd still need predictions to future data; 2) even if that were so, it certainly would not be the end of statistics, since sampling theory is a tiny subset of statistics.)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The genius of Google was there from day one, in September 1998, when Stanford students Sergey Brin and Larry Page designed a new web tool, called a search engine, that could skip across the internet in search of keywords.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Search was <i>not</i> a new tool: Knowbot (1989), Archie (1990), Wandex (1993), Mosaic...<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  We saw the world differently and approached it from entirely different angles. My whole life has been a quest to gain relevance and fear of never achieving it, whereas Arthur's biggest fear (I believe) was losing it.<br/></blockquote><br/>In what way are those two angles entirely different?<br/><br/>This was unintentionally revealing:<br/><blockquote><br/>  Attractive things work better... When you wash and wax a car, it drives better, doesn't it? Or at least feels like it does.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And this:<br/><blockquote><br/>  Malcolm Gladwell, the Jesus of business books...<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>There's the rub, I think. This is a business book, and since I haven't read any "business books" in years I was unprepared for its fawning, glibness, and applause lights. Galloway is no doubt in the right lane; it was I that drifted.<br/><br/>Skip it. The subject - this tiny set of untouchable, market-breaking corporations with large fanbases and financial carte blanche - is important to understand, too important to leave it to Galloway.
