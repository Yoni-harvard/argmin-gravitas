Max Chafkin (2021)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2022<br>
<br>
Very skewed, but at least in the opposite direction to other things you might have read.

Interesting to see the inevitable failures, Halcyon and Clarium and TechFellows and all that. But Chafkin doesn't understand Thiel, because he sees only his selfishness and spite, because that's all he wants to see. 

Chafkin claims that the Thiel Fellowship was created the day before it was announced, in order to counter Thiel's malign portrayal in The Social Network.

I actually think contrarianism is the salient characteristic, but Chafkin doesn't want to talk about this being a source of success (investing, donating) and accuracy, as well as a source of ugliness and defection.

CONTRERAS (2009)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2022<br>
<br>
Simplistic and small. (I don't even know anything about Mexico but I can tell.) Mostly a mere digest of headlines from the 80s and 90s.

It's interesting to see such entrenched left nationalism, and the passive aggression this yields. (e.g. At the 2004 Olympics qualifiers, the Mexican crowd taunted the US team by chanting "Osama!".) This is based on centuries of US perfidy. (But the US was also sometimes just indifferent - Roosevelt  even ignores the nationalization of the oil industry which turfed out American barons.)

Contreras has the atheoretical partial scepticism of an American journalist. He trucks in limp abstractions, "vibrant" "Mexicanness", with no details. He takes no positions, just quotes. The strongest value judgment in the book is being angry at frozen margaritas (a "travesty").

His evidence is hopefully apposite anecdotes. "By the summer of 2007, the number of in country American volunteers had swollen to forty-five."
Occasionally self-aware:

<blockquote>
The warming [of diplomatic relations] went unnoticed by most of us in the Mexico City foreign press corps</blockquote>



One good bit is him teaching me slang:

* Ciudad de Mexico: "El D.F." (el Distrito Federal)
* Person from CDMX: "Chilango" (chilli-ape)
* Seat of power: "Los Pinos"
* To Americanize: "Agringado"
* The other side (of the border): "El Otro Lado"

Encounters with unlucky Americans and the system that thieves money and part of their lives. The human cost of credential inflation and hegemonic education.

45% of the 20 million annual enrolments do not finish the course. A lot of this is due to ability deficit (measured by remedial class enrollment), besides obvious financial constraints. Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheepskin_effect">the sheepskin effect</a> - part of a degree is not worth much to the job market - and the low social return on completed education, this means billions of dollars, and millions of years of life wasted. Not to mention the unnecessary stress and humiliation of pushing people into it. 

This book is just a minor autobiographical expansion of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/in-the-basement-of-the-ivory-tower/306810/">this</a> essay; you should read Caplan instead.

80% of the value is the title. (It’s no small thing to reify and embody a cool newish archetype. I’m not scoring the man.) props but not points for the book’s style and like typesetting representing the bit, too.

What dissatisfies me (as so often with this part of thought) is the absence of earned transcendence, rigour, apt grandeur. Yes, I like being happy. Yes, being kind is not actually in conflict with being smart. Yes, learning social skills is interesting and worthwhile and actually a kind of public service. Yes, we often raise children to be self-limiting. Now what? What are his ambitions? To be himself, more. Who are his models in this endeavour? “Prince, Bowie or Hendrix… Richard Feynman… David Ogilvy”. In being meta and self-referential he is most like the latter.

There is, though, a clearer view of the collective nature of rationality here than in deeper and more searching equivalent work.

Visa is a very good tweeter. And for all my hard-earned cynicism about the hollowness and insincerity of books and their readers, this book of tweets reveals the large gap between megathread and actual book. 

Don’t let me discourage you if you are very young. Possibly essential for burned-out gifted kids or helicoptered kids or machinic EAs or otherwise disembodied and anhedonic young men. But you probably need something much stronger than this, something to be a blowtorch of prose. Good luck

It has no detail really - no music trivia, no drawing mechanics, no sex mechanics.

Fans only. Though you probably will be one, if you've given him the time: he is unusual among rock auteurs, populist and wholesome to the point of naivete:<blockquote>I was... a circumstantial bohemian - I didn't do any drugs or drink... I was barely holding on to myself as it was. I couldn't imagine introducing unknown agents into my system. I needed control and those ever-elusive boundaries... Music was going to get me as high as I needed to go... the counterculture stood by definition in opposition to the conservative blue-collar experience I'd had.</blockquote>


Prose is clumsy enough to be actually his work, and is eloquent by rockstar standards:

<blockquote>When it rains, the moisture in the humid air blankets our town with the smell of damp coffee grounds wafting in from the Nescafé factory at the town’s eastern edge. I don’t like coffee but I like that smell. It’s comforting; it unites the town in a common sensory experience; it’s good industry, like the roaring rug mill that fills our ears, brings work and signals our town’s vitality. There is a place here—you can hear it, smell it—where people make lives, suffer pain, enjoy small pleasures, play baseball, die, make love, have kids, drink themselves drunk on spring nights and do their best to hold off the demons that seek to destroy us, our homes, our families, our town...</blockquote>


He's had thirty years of psychotherapy, the poor sod. He is intellectual enough to take his feelings and their theories seriously - but not intellectual enough to be sceptical about their interminable and unscientific faffing.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34427200">"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google"</a></h3>

Scott Galloway (2017)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2018<br>
<br>
Not the book I thought it was: I wanted searching political / macroeconomic expose of the costs of monopoly, but this is shallow and glib work on a topic of great importance. Galloway's a marketing professor / entrepreneur, and so this is a weird mix of polemical and fawning. (OK, I should've guessed its genre from the thoughtless use of institutional "DNA" in the subtitle.) There's basically no politics in this: it's a primer for worried and pious businessmen more than consumers or citizens or engineers. It also uses "relevant" unironically as a quantity of ultimate importance ("Google had a market cap that topped $200 billion. But the Times was enormously relevant".

I enjoyed this

<blockquote>
  [education], the cartel that masquerades as a social good but is really a caste system
</blockquote>



and this (though his counterproposal wouldn't change much either):

<blockquote>
It is conventional wisdom that Steve Jobs put 'a dent in the universe.' No, he didn’t. Steve Jobs, in my view, spat on the universe. People who get up every morning, get their kids dressed, get them to school, and have an irrational passion for their kids’ well-being, dent the universe. The world needs more homes with engaged parents, not a better fucking phone.
</blockquote>



He presents himself as a critical outsider, and a moralist, but in between his rants he is scarcely less fawning about a set of overpriced electronics:

<blockquote>
In those ten years, Apple introduced one earth-shaking, 100-billion-dollar, categorycreating new product or service after another. The iPod, iTunes/Apple Store, iPhone, and iPad ... there has never been anything like it.

The iPod's introduction, in late 2001 after the twin shocks of the bursting of the dot-com bubble and 9/11, played the same role as the Beatles' appearance on Ed Sullivan just months after the Kennedy assassination: it was a bright light in the darkness that signaled hope and optimism. 
</blockquote>



And often his barbs are just glib. His full argument against Bezos' support for basic income:

<blockquote>
What's clear is that we need business leaders who envision and enact a future with more jobs — not billionaires who want the government to fund, with taxes they avoid, social programs for people to sit on their couches and watch Netflix all day. Jeff, show some real fucking vision.
</blockquote>




Besides the hollowness, there are dozens of minor errors or infelicities:

<blockquote>
  Luxury is not an externality; it's in our genes. It combines our instinctive need to transcend the human condition and feel closer to divine perfection, with our desire to be more attractive to potential mates. 
</blockquote>


(That's not what "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externality</a>" means.)

<blockquote>
Because media companies only get a mildly insane valuation, and the Four are addicted to iconospheric valuations — hundreds of billions. 
</blockquote>


("Ionospheric" rather)

<blockquote>
   When Nietzsche proclaimed God is dead, it wasn't a victory cry but a lamentation on the loss of moral compass.
</blockquote>


(1) "compass" makes for a really poor adjective, please don't do that; 2) that's a ludicrous reading, though less silly than the usual macho triumph one.)

<blockquote>
  The effectiveness of prayer, the additional scrutiny determined, remains a matter of opinion.
</blockquote>


(Sure, for a pejorative sense of "opinion".)

<blockquote>
  [big data] signals the end of sampling and statistics - now you can just track the shopping pattern of every customer in every one of your stores
</blockquote>


(1) this is the "n=all" dogma and, though very popular among people with bridges to sell, it is just not true - because no one ever has the full data set, because even if they did have a synchronous snapshot then we'd still need predictions to future data; 2) even if that were so, it certainly would not be the end of statistics, since sampling theory is a tiny subset of statistics.)

<blockquote>
The genius of Google was there from day one, in September 1998, when Stanford students Sergey Brin and Larry Page designed a new web tool, called a search engine, that could skip across the internet in search of keywords.
</blockquote>



Search was not a new tool: Knowbot (1989), Archie (1990), Wandex (1993), Mosaic...

<blockquote>
  We saw the world differently and approached it from entirely different angles. My whole life has been a quest to gain relevance and fear of never achieving it, whereas Arthur's biggest fear (I believe) was losing it.
</blockquote>


In what way are those two angles entirely different?

This was unintentionally revealing:

<blockquote>
  Attractive things work better... When you wash and wax a car, it drives better, doesn't it? Or at least feels like it does.
</blockquote>



And this:

<blockquote>
  Malcolm Gladwell, the Jesus of business books...
</blockquote>



There's the rub, I think. This is a business book, and since I haven't read any "business books" in years I was unprepared for its fawning, glibness, and applause lights. Galloway is no doubt in the right lane; it was I that drifted.

Skip it. The subject - this tiny set of untouchable, market-breaking corporations with large fanbases and financial carte blanche - is important to understand, too important to leave it to Galloway.

<br>
Pointless. It mocks a certain small, ridiculous group - C21st upper-middle-class lefty American hipsters -and ignores the rest of its titular target. What does it mean to say that  The Wire, green tea, or public transport are white things? Not that they're not for other people. Not that most whites like them (they don't). Not that they're bad. Not that they're good. The point is to mock pretentious people, whose contempt for practicality, and idiot love of anything which calls itself authentic or nonmainstream, are very fun to bash. Mere socially acceptable stereotyping; the site exists to let people chortle and roll their eyes, get revenge on ponces.

But if you're interested in mocking that group you already knew what the fads are, so you and Lander are just patting each other on the back, or, rather, reaching around.

Insofar as it encourages self-consciousness among accidentally-consumerist hipsters: ok. Insofar as it sneers at trends that actually could change the world if adopted en masse (e.g. vegetarianism, cycling, taking the fucking train), go away.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62083783">"Paper Belt on Fire: How Renegade Investors Sparked a Revolt Against the University"</a></h3>

Michael Gibson (2022)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2022<br>
<br>
Fairly embarrassing half memoir, half rant. One common feature of the (public-facing) Thielverse is cussedness: being so annoyed and contemptuous, of whatever, that you become annoying and contemptible. As you'd expect, Gibson is incredibly derivative of Thiel and has the same tubthumping view of the productivity and science slowdown and the spiritual failures it uncovers. It is absolutely true that credentialism is out of control and that many authorities do not deserve respect. But dismaying to see people who agree frothing at the mouth and arguing by spicy adjective.

I have no idea if his fund is any good. Something about his pitch rings my alarms. (Merton Scholes.):

<blockquote>1517 Fund’s returns place it in the top one or two percent of all funds in its class. So the fact that we perform this well, are a brand new fund competing against the Yankees, and limit ourselves to investing in dropouts or people who never went to college is truly extraordinary.</blockquote>



(The "paper belt" is the East Coast words-based industry: media, education, ads, banking. Gibson gleefully imagines making a rust belt of it. This would be more convincing if he had some idea of what to replace it with. Remember that the culture war is first of all an intra-elite thing.)

The first few years of the Thiel Fellowship drew in some of the age's defining independent scientists/engineers/businesspeople (e.g. Laura Deming, Chris Olah, Vitalik Buterin, David Luan). It's not clear how much of this is due to Gibson and Strachmann, though subjectively it seems worse since they left. (At least half of this fall will be due to the adversarial hacking of the application process of anything high-status which is older than a few years. In hindsight it's impressive that they held it off for more than one iteration.) It's pretty daft of him to suggest that this kind of programme could replace education, that they "represent not some group of extraordinary outliers, who cannot be taken as a model for the average student, but the beginning of a new era in education". 

This bit accidentally makes Thiel look like a shallow rube (or physiognomist):

<blockquote>At the end of our deliberations, we’d go to Peter’s house to show him who we were picking and why. The first year, we were in his dining room, standing around the table. Peter was looking down at a sheet of photographs of the twenty we’d chosen. Danielle remembers thinking, “Are we really doing this?” Peter scanned the photos in silence, nodded, and gave his customary approval: “Ok, looks good.”</blockquote>



His concept of "edge control" (basically: stomach for uncertainty, ability to act well despite bad info) is a good one.

Somehow this book makes what he has done seem less impressive.

Most common phrases in this are ‘surely’ and ‘in my view’ (e.g. he just says that the Greeks probably had our kind of parental affections), which is nice.

Much better than its title and its character designs and its colouring. Something about the art screams webcomic, maybe the number of flat colour segments and the absence of brushstrokes. But it’s no Book of Dave.

The book is centred around the Freaks’ reparations for causing the apocalypse. Except half of em don’t seem contrite (“it’s quieter now. Remember how everyone used to kill themselves just getting through the day?”)

The Whitechapel commune is presented as a lovely sexy anprim haven. But they don’t produce any industrial stuff, they’re running out of salvage, and god knows how they keep their steampunk vehicles going. The short term dream.

Lots of audience applause shots of London landmarks underwater, including my manor. Not doing it for me though.

Interesting touch on p21: a ghostly panel line dividing one panel, in which a characters muses on the nature of time; he says 40 words in this panel, so maybe 10 seconds. And yet by the magic of comics these seconds happen to the reader despite him not moving.

The emotional case for not being religious. I should like him - he is the most honourable instance of a public figure rationally changing his mind in living memory. And another thing sorely needed: a sympathetic, literate public nonbeliever. Also he quotes poetry from memory - for its sense, not in order to curry literary status. (We know this because he leaves the attribution of the poems to the endnotes.) He is adorable, basically, and <a href="http://afterallitcouldbeworse.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/highlighted-passages-in-holloways.html">quotable</a> to boot.

As a boy he loved religion's melodrama and un-Scottish grandeur; he goes away to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Sacred_Mission">eccentric militarist monastery</a>, aged 14:

<blockquote>
We were up at six-thirty for a cold shower followed by mass and breakfast. After household chores we were moved into study mode until the next visit to chapel at midday. After lunch, afternoons were given over to heavy labour, either scrubbing and shining floors or labouring for Brother Edward in the grounds... back to study at four, till bells summoned us to Evensong at six-thirty. Then dinner, more washing up and more study. The day ended at nine-thirty with Compline, then lights out... Each evening we left chapel in silence, under the spell of fading plainsong that marked the ending of the day. </blockquote>


Fun! Rammed full of order and space, but not religion per se. He was always unorthodox: he gave communion to just anyone who walked into church, happily married off divorcees, joined the LGBT movement and even claims to have held a Catholic gay marriage in the 90s. I am childish enough to enjoy his swearing, as the Bishop said to the actress. He had no more place on a <a href="http://www.hfea.gov.uk/Authority-members.html">government bioethics committee</a> than any other nice clever old man, but I don't suppose he did any harm at all.

In one sentence: Religion is pretty nice, but you must take it less seriously.

Tom   Leonard (1990)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Feb 2014<br>
<br>
A nice thing about Britain, or the Old World at large, is that there’s a piece of art for most places. Thus even my tiny village has a passable ballad, ‘<a href="http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/where-river-meets-sea-1997-by-john.html">where the river meets the sea</a>’, while my mate’s Wirral has a full <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fkid-reflux.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F06%2Fand-he-rode-forth-to-wirral-where-mens.html&amp;ei=pnk4U6a9J8aShgfak4CoCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSbSqSt3puRmCiuQtTB-qZi9ZGZQ&amp;sig2=cdqcC1xJgqMPjCP5qj63rA&amp;bvm=bv.63808443,d.ZG4">seven hundred years</a> of contempt to draw on (as well as my top <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/four-lads-who-shook-the-wirral-mw0001459625">album</a> of 1998). 

Paisley has the first bit of Espedair Street – but also hundreds of Industrial Era pamphlets and gazetteers that Tom Leonard dug through, finding a hotbed of utopian socialism, zero-wave feminism and farmer’s rage. (I don’t know if it’ll sink in with locals though; they’re more likely to get excited about Gerard Butler going to Paisley Grammar.) "Radical" isn't a compliment, as Leonard (and Kelman, and Nairn, and Macleod) think it is, but it often marks at least interesting things.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6484260">"My Shit Life So Far"</a></h3>

Frankie Boyle (2009)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Oct 2013<br>
<br>
He is more than he’d have us think he is – but that isn’t saying much, since his core gag is wanking over inappropriate objects and taunting the weak. Book is tolerable when he’s busy liking things – Chomsky’s politics, Grant Morrison’s comics, Moorcock, old Clydeside socialism – and hating on the powerful (his portrayal of the civil service is great fun). 

Includes a cursory rant against PC, a phenomenon he bizarrely (satirically?) blames on the Mail. Humane islands in an insincere sea. 

On marriage: “Fuck it, I tried”; “we struggled along like badly set bones”. Makes Gill look like Tolstoy. Higher humour’s about laughing at yourself.

<br>

Tiny happy columns on false proofs, primacy wars, Newton as a gigantic loon, and the Swiss maths scene. He assumes no background - explaining primes even - but is concise and so not hand-holding. Lots of repetition because originally standalone columns, lots of bucolia because he likes mathematicians so much. Harsh words for Wolfram, though. The banality of eternal truth:

<blockquote>
The next morning Mignotte informed him that he thought the proof [of the 500 hundred year old Catalan conjecture] was correct. They did not rejoice, but they were very happy.

Ellis Cashmore (2006)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Oct 2013<br>
<br>
Kinda lightweight sociology. Picked it because it asks the right questions in its Contents table (“What part did consumer society play in making us dote on celebrities? When did the paparazzi appear and how do they pedestalise and destroy people? How are cosmetic surgery and the preoccupation with physical perfection linked to celebrity culture? Why have black celebrities been used as living proof of the end of racism? How have disgrace and sexual indignity helped some celebrities climb onto the A-list?”). 

But while chatty, he’s critical in an uncritical way, high on anecdote, low on data - and there are no citations. Cashmore’s answers are thus suspect, trendy. The big contrarian move in sociology is to view fans as active & canny manipulators of the ‘culture’ but I don't care either way.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/481883">"The Donald Richie Reader: 50 Years of Writing on Japan"</a></h3>

Donald Richie (2001)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2016<br>
<br>
The greatest gaijin? Famous for introducing Japan's cinema to the West, but actually fewer than half of his thoughts are anything to do with that. Richie has an eC20th directness about describing other peoples - think Martha Gellhorn or Kipling - their 'pure skin', their atrocity-enabling 'innocence', their circuitousness and tribalism. (It is now sometimes inappropriate, sometimes oppressive to emphasise differences so.)

<blockquote>I cannot imagine Plato thriving here [Japan], with all his absolutes (“the truth,” “the beauty”)... Maybe that is why Japan is so backward (by comparison) in some areas: philosophy, diagnosis. And perhaps why it is so forward in others.

From the celebrated farting-contest scroll and the early illustrated He Gassen (The Fart Battle), up to such recent representations as the delightful farting games in Ozu Yazujiro's Ohayo, Japan's culture is filled with vivid examples... Farting is certainly included in the nature of man:

<blockquote>
"And what is it you all
Are laughing at, may I ask?"
The retired master's fart.

Four or five people
Inconvenienced
By the horse farting
The long ferry ride.
</blockquote>


Just here, I think, is the difference in attitude between Japan and the West. That a thing is is sufficient to warrant its notice, even celebration. The hypocrisy of the idealistic has not until recently infected Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp:In both cultures the fart is funny but only in Japan is its humanity acknowledged. This entails a full acceptance of the human state. There is even a rubric for such matters, the ningen-kusai ("smelling of humanity") and within it the hé (屁) takes an honorable place.
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
What do I want to be when I grow up? An attractive role would be that of the bunjin. He is the Japanese scholar who wrote and painted in the Chinese style, a literatus, something of a poetaster - a pose popular in the 18th century. I, however, would be a later version, someone out of the end of the Meiji, who would pen elegant prose and work up flower arrangements from dried grasses and then encourage spiders to make webs and render it all natural. For him, art is a moral force and he cannot imagine life without it. He is also the kind of casual artist who, after a day's work is done, descends into his pleasure park and dallies.
</blockquote>


Similar to Hitchens in its consistent, adventurous aestheticism, though with much quieter prose; however, neither has that certain Alastair Reid transcendence. Minus a half for seriously ugly layout and typography, but I will seek out his real books.

In one sentence: Ah, so innocent, so subtle, so far from Ohio.

It's greedy in the algorithmic sense: snatching in a straight line for the most obvious and trite and clumsy sources of meaning. 
At least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flarf_poetry">flarf</a> was an ethos. ("rejected conventional standards of quality" indeed)

(They realise that <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/56645/government-spending">Lockwood</a> is pretty good but don't show her off well so they don't understand why.)

Ed Ruscha did this 60 years ago you fucks. 

The best of internet writing is among the rawest and most deviant writing, because no one could edit it, no one could desk reject it, and because no one could tell who wrote it to punish them preemptively in their own head just before they wrote it. "Based" was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/based">gaining currency</a> just as they went to print.

<br>

Does Expressionism do anything but look cool and foil the old School of Paris? 

I’m a slave to content, so I resent the mindless haste and vitiating freedom of Pollock and Co’s anti-painting, born of the macho belief in chaos (cf. Hunter Thompson, Jim Morrison, Debord). But Pollock’s not empty nor, really, chaotic. Apart from anything else, he makes Picasso look smooth and Mannered, a useful service. Apart from anything else, nothing made or viewed by humans can be non-representational. I like Full Fathom Five & The Deep (1953).

<br>
Like Death Note via My Name is Earl: nonobnoxious melodrama. Natsume is cleaning up after his psycho grandmother, with an obviously Satanic familiar by his side. But it’s all relentlessly wholesome and pleasant, and the dangers are met with understanding and at most a punch in the mouth.

There’s also a Small Gods angle - spirits as parasite memeplexes - but even this gets given a good hard scrubbing, so that the small god is happy to fade with his last human follower.

Almost closed the book when the boy seals the stupidest deal with Kitty Satan: KS gets the terrible artefact… as soon as the boy dies.

Its cuteness and positivity is quite strange, almost edgy: there’s plenty of tragedy (the baby bird abandoned by its nest, Natsume being too spaced out to relate to any other humans) but it’s all smiling and defanged. I can’t decide if this is artful or artless. A slice of life artist trying to do horror.

<br>
Book of aphorisms, glorifying unanalysed practice and the majority of the world which is beyond theory. Self-consciously Wittgensteinian (PI), as he declares repeatedly in the preface. This declaration is a shame, because it means that his nice-enough notes on perception, knowledge and emotion are vastly, vastly overshadowed by the giant spectre he has called up; it's PI without the thought experiments and devastating reductios. But a nice supplement to it:

<blockquote>Look at your hand. Its structure does not match the structure of assertions, the structure of facts. Your hand is continuous. Assertions and facts are discontinuous.... You lift your index finger half an inch; it passes through a million facts. Look at the way your hand goes on and on, while the clock ticks, and the sun moves a little further across the sky.</blockquote>

<br>
A very close redux of the first book, but without this being annoying (like Leviathan Wakes it has: a lost child as Macguffin, a dastardly black-lab Earth conspiracy, and Holden blabbing way too much on every frequency). Highly readable, went through it in two sittings.

A new character, Prax, is even more annoying and Hollywood-emotional than Holden, which might be intentional to make us disdain Holden less. Villains were sketched extremely roughly: there's actually barely any scenes with them.  

How does it do as Serious science fiction?

Social development: Very little. Same political structures, similar international antipathies. There's UBI and a world government on Earth but no sign of the associated efficiencies or psychological gains. There's one polyamorous commune mentioned.

Software development: Basically none. People still dock spaceships by hand, which we've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Transfer_Vehicle">left behind</a>. Naomi hacks on "basically all" of the milspec software on the Rocinante, which is impossible to do safely with current tooling.

 Actual Science: there is serious air and food scarcity in the outer planets, which is good. The heroic vigilante mission is shown being crowdsourced, which is charming.

Isaac Asimov (2004)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2022<br>
<br>
In which it is revealed that the Seldon Plan is overfit. (It's only a model.)

Surprisingly hippieish, Huxleyish, with it lauding mental science over physical science.

<blockquote>in a society given over... to the physical sciences and inanimate technology, there was a vague but mighty sociological push away from the study of the mind</blockquote>


The obvious rejection is of behaviorism. But the main claim of psychohistory, of the predictability of the exact course of human history, goes way beyond behaviorism in some ways.

This is funny out of context:

<blockquote>The Executive Council of the Second Foundation was in session. To us they are merely voices. Neither the exact scene of the meeting nor the identity of those present are essential at the point. 

Nor, strictly speaking, can we even consider an exact reproduction of any part of the session - unless we wish to sacrifice completely even the minimum comprehensibility we have a right to expect. 

We deal here with psychologists - and not merely psychologists. Let us say, rather, scientists with a psychological orientation. That is, men whose fundamental conception of scientific philosophy is pointed in an entirely different direction from all of the orientations we know.</blockquote>


We finally get some details about psychohistory.

<blockquote>Psychohistory had been the development of mental science, the final mathematicization thereof, rather, which had finally succeeded. Through the development of the mathematics necessary to understand the facts of neural physiology and the electrochemistry of the nervous system, which themselves had to be, had to be, traced down to nuclear forces, it first became possible to truly develop psychology. And through the generalization of psychological 
knowledge from the individual to the group, sociology was also mathematicized. </blockquote>


The Seldon Plan has mumbo-jumbo mathematical derivations between steps, but he here admits that has of course been modified and falsified and had its assumptions violated. So it's not an apriori mathematical theory: it's a model.

<blockquote>The Seldon Plan is neither complete nor correct... They've watched nearly four hundred years pass and against the predictions and equations, they've checked reality, and they have learned.</blockquote>


Reading between the lines, the Seldon Plan is what we now call a probabilistic program. (It's not just a DAG because it has forks and conditionals.) One distribution per planet, and about 30 million planets. This is about 10,000 times beyond current practical model sizes, but this is a weak objection. 

Their adapting the plan over the centuries is obviously sane, and I'm glad to see Asimov's sense of realism here. But this also introduces massive overfitting risk! There is no test set for politics.

(Ada Palmer's Brillists are Second Foundationers. Both slightly ridiculous, both overpowered and absurdly soft-peddling it.)

---

One obvious note I missed until this third book is that Asimov isn't an authoritarian, and the Foundation is not his utopia. The Plan is the ultimate paternalism, and the Second Foundationeers' mind control the ultimate unaccountable authority. So Asimov is not in fact endorsing psychohistory and the Plan and the supremacy of scientists over all, including other scientists. Or if he is, he shouldn't be.

<blockquote>The Second Empire is not yet formed. We have still a society which would resent a ruling class of psychologists, and which would fear its development and fight against it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Rossemites had blinked solemnly, uncertain of the word "taxes." When collection time came, many had paid, or had stood by in confusion while the uniformed, other-wordlings loaded the harvested corn and the pelts on to the broad ground-cars. 

Here and there indignant peasants banded together and brought out ancient hunting weapons - but of this nothing ever came. Grumblingly they had disbanded when the men of Tazenda came and with dismay watched their hard struggle for existence become harder... The tax-farmers, Rossemites in the employ of Tazenda, came periodically, but they were creatures of custom now  and the peasant had learned how to hide his grain and drive his cattle into the forest, and refrain from having his hut appear too ostentatiously prosperous. Then with a dull, uncomprehending expression he would greet all sharp questioning as to his assets by merely pointing at what they could see. </blockquote>

One of his few pieces of good writing is the Fiddler on the Roof scene where the farmers see the spaceship landing and rush to host the rich offworlders.

<blockquote>She snuffled: "It is a ship from outer space." 
And Narovi remarked impatiently: "And what else could it be? We have visitors, old woman, 
visitors!" 
The ship was sinking slowly to a landing on the bare frozen field in the northern portions of 
Narovi's farm. 
"But what shall we do?" gasped the woman. "Can we offer these people hospitality? Is the dirt 
floor of our hovel to be theirs and the pickings of last week's hoecake?" 
"Shall they then go to our neighbors?"</blockquote>

<spoiler>I don't like the fall of the Mule. You get this symbolic victory in fiction a lot - where the loser deduces the consequences of the current situation and stops fighting, offers up their throat. A real psycho, a real mule, would struggle irrationally until they were stopped.

Even before his neutering, the motivation Asimov gives him - the ugly envious outsider kid looking for revenge - is too simplistic to be satisfying. (I accept that there seem to be such people.)</spoiler>

Wildcard psychologist writes meh tongue-twisters about the horror of recursivity.

<blockquote>“JACK: Forgive me.
JILL: No.
JACK: I’ll never forgive you for not forgiving me.” </blockquote>



His point’s that conflict escalates because we forget the original contention and argue about the argument instead. Which is neat if not exhaustive. His logic’s more sophisticated than I expected – “Jack sees / that there is something Jill can’t see and Jack sees / that Jill can’t see she can’t see it. // Although Jack can see Jill can’t see she can’t see it / he can’t see that he can’t see it himself.” – but repetition kills the wit.

Dominique Goblet (2017)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2021<br>
<br>
Messy, mildly impressive. She switches between half a dozen styles (crayon, smudged charcoal, heavy pencil, what looks like felt tip with most of the panel untouched, simulating intense white light, scraped acrylic abstract landscapes) with no clear meaning. There are ghosts everywhere (the people you remember, the ones you wish were here). Everyone is bitter, dishonest, haranguing except the wee girl. Also melodrama, but bad luck in love does that to people. Niki’s tiny beaming gestures are the best bit. The weird shuffling makes it seem like a diary - you don’t need to introduce anyone in your diary or mention them more than once or for more than 3 panels. But then it’s a memoir where you also show your cheating lover with his ex while you’re still back at home, and don’t make much effort to sketch his inner life and show him telling you lies you can’t disprove…

(The lover is thanked in the Acknowledgments, so maybe they’re just radically open about their vices with each other, and explain their deceptions. This would be an odd pairing of vice and virtue: vicious enough to cheat and manipulate and lie, secure and honourable enough to admit it and accept your own shit)

She doesn’t spare herself much - shown lovelorn and ineffectual, a dupe who finishes the book falling for more of GM’s lies.

Overall it leaves a mucky feeling, and besides the style switching there’s not much to set it above your average experimental indie bit.

Cambridge neuroscientist lets himself go, speculating a bit aimlessly on the meaning and ends of present trends. He goes via Gilgamesh, Swift and Woolf as much as HeLa, Hayflick and Kirkwood. Core evidence-based conclusions are: Life expectancy increases are not slowing down much; dementia is exploding upwards; we know very little about aging and have almost no power over it (but a start has been made – e.g. we know inflammation is important if not the core – and ). The core attitudinal point is to view aging as a disease and death an injustice. Cute (“build a dream, write that novel… have lots of sex”), and it comes from an insider, but not so deep.

Terry Pratchett (2013)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2021<br>
<br>
I've been putting off reading this for 8 years, and sadly I was right to. The magic has gone, in two senses. The jokes are flat, the theme repetitive, the jokes repetitive or failed callbacks across the series (nobless obligay). Severe shortage of his inspired similes. The theme is Progress, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment">Disenchantment</a>, and I have loved Pratchett's human view on it, when it was subtler.

Far too many cameos, in the pure sense of "hey I member them". Perhaps self-consciously a final encore. Far too many rushed innovations, filling in British trainspotter culture in a rush.

There's yet another species to emancipate and, harder, to normalise. The goblins are the nerd race, apparently: clever and smelly and hunted for sport. This looks glib, compared to say the manumission of the golem-slaves, but then nerdiness is an understudied element in the unfinished industrial revolution and the nature of the modern world.

<blockquote>Their scruffy little faces were wreathed in smiles at the sight of something metallic and complicated. It was a sign of the times, he thought, and it looks like time for the goblins. 
</blockquote>


The villains are also a repeat from "Thud", except even harder to empathise with. Terrorism is quite modern. Here we have religious fundamentalists as mere idiots:

<blockquote>Ardent had followers, stupid followers, and he also had powerful friends. And that was it. Politics. Politics was like those little wooden sliding-pictures games for children: you had to move all of the pieces in the hope of finding a place where the whole picture slotted together.
</blockquote>


The counterattack against the grags is one of the few instances I can remember where the violence is just violence, unlamented.

The general Weberian disenchantment of the later Disc is undermined by the steam engine itself having sentience. This is consistent with Small Gods / Moving Pictures / Soul Music, where mass belief in an idea gives birth to a quasi-real egregore.

At the same time that the wizards - the singular wielders of absolute power - are being sidelined, Vetinari is shrinking. He is still tyrant here, but his viciousness is pathetic, limited to reflexive sarcasm and insisting on a pet project train line. Actually Pratchett's retaining Vetinari the benevolent despot into the Victorian age of the Disc is quite edgy and rich. Despite his protests, Ankh-Morpork is not London, not New York: it's Singapore, or Kowloon. Human rights without democracy; economic freedom without representation. At the end, the Disc is completely modern - apart from the government! I don't have a good theory of whether this is unrealistic. 

The gag is that Vetinari is benevolent while being an assassin and a torturer, a fearsome, malevolent altruist. But he hasn't been conspicuously violent in 10 books and here he's a cipher, a shrugging habitual snarker.

I was surprised to see Pratchett include (in an aside by an extra) the anti-globalisation McWorld viewpoint: progress as destroying something.

<blockquote>He wasn’t a philosopher and couldn’t even spell the word, but the voice of the goblin officer rang in his head. He thought, what would happen if goblins learned everything about humans and did everything the human way because they thought it was better than the goblin way? How long would it be before they were no longer goblins and left behind everything that was goblin, even their pots? The pots were lovely, he’d bought several for his mum. Goblins took pots seriously now, they sparkled, even at night, but what happens next? Will goblins really stop taking an interest in their pots and will humans learn the serious, valuable and difficult and almost magical skill of pot-making? Or will goblins become, well, just another kind of human? And which would be better?

  And then he thought, maybe a policeman should stop thinking about all this because, after all, there was no crime, nothing was wrong … and yet in a subtle way, there was. Something was being stolen from the world without anybody noticing or caring. 
</blockquote>


The solution to this true sighing is to note that cultures are for people, and that if people freely choose to leave a culture behind, up to the last member, then we have gained more than we lost. 

Anyway. The Discworld remains the most nourishing and loveable way to show young people the key to human history and to humane ends.

</blockquote>


- obviously I had to read <a href="http://apjjf.org/-C.-Douglas-Lummis/2474/article.html">the book this sentence refers to</a>,<br>and pay it much more heed than I otherwise would've


War anthropology! That is, anthropology conducted by the opposite side of a total war, for predictive military purposes of the highest consequence. She was of course robbed of the moral superiority of field work by an ocean and a bunch of tanks and whatnot, so this is all based on expat interviews and extremely secondary sources. I'm still struggling to overcome my deep suspicion of cultural anthropology; thus I was actively drawn to Benedict by <a href="http://apjjf.org/-C.-Douglas-Lummis/2474/article.html">this hatchet job</a>, by a modern relativist anthropologist. 

Sadly the book's only ok, very nicely written but falsely general. She introduces the key terms of the toxic wartime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido:_The_Soul_of_Japan">Inazo</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonn%C5%8D_j%C5%8Di">Satsuma</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statism_in_Sh%C5%8Dwa_Japan">Shówa</a> ideology, but mislabels this particular modernist system as "the Japanese worldview". Even so, in the one truly essential passage, Benedict lays out (and later tries to ameliorate) a popular reified caricature of the Japanese: as morbid, conformist, and paradoxical:

<blockquote>the Japanese have been described in the most fantastic series of ‘...but also's’ ever used for any nation of the world.  When a serious observer is writing about peoples other than the Japanese and says they are unprecedentedly polite, he is not likely to add, ‘But also insolent and overbearing.’ When he says people of some nation are incomparably rigid in their behaviour, he does not add, 'But they also adapt themselves readily to extreme innovations'. When he says a people are submissive, he does not explain too that they are not easily amenable to control from above... When he says they act mostly out of concern for others' opinions, he does not then go on to tell that they have a truly terrifying conscience...

When he writes a book on a nation with a popular cult of aestheticism which gives high honor to actors and to artists and lavishes art upon the cultivation of chrysanthemums, that book does not ordinarily have to be supplemented by another which is devoted to the cult of the sword and the top prestige of the warrior... All these contradictions, however, are the warp and woof of books on Japan.  They are true.  Both the sword and the chrysanthemum are a part of the picture.  The Japanese are to the highest degree, both aggressive and unaggressive, both militaristic and aesthetic, both insolent and polite, rigid and adaptable, submissive and resentful of being pushed around, loyal and treacherous, brave and timid, conservative and hospitable to new ways.
</blockquote>


People say she made this worse, but you can't claim that she didn't know something was up with the Western concepts used. There's an intriguing suggestion that the book is actually a satire (Geertz: "The Chrysanthemum and the Sword is no more a prettied-up science-without-tears policy tract than [Gulliver's Travels] is a children's book."). But she actually was attached to military intelligence at the time and actually interviewed Japanese-American internees, and I find I don't much care either way.

Pamphlet about PC by a man most famous for arguing that Britain’s AIDS came from African immigrants. 

Tricky: the pamphlet is pumped up with outrage, and on the face of it his central claim is hallucinatory tabloid racism at its worst. On the other hand, he’s careful to list PC’s achievements, and official figures underlie some of his arguments. I wasn't skilled enough to judge when I read this.

Like everyone, he tries to claim the rational high ground over his enemies, but the connection between identity politics and postmodern irrationality is nowhere near the tight causation he claims. He seems to be genuinely hurt by the reaction to his argument.

Reality is fucked up; if we can’t even test any hypothesis which offends anyone, then we are doomed to delusion and early death.

Witty and sloppy synopsis. It is neither materialist nor idealist: he locates power in single people. Or, in anecdotes about people really. (Is that still materialism? Funny kind if so.) 

He has such a huge throbbing agenda - e.g. his <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IH_eVPFSuxMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=victorians+an+wilson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf1a6m1LzNAhULB8AKHQLJANsQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=benthamite&amp;f=false">caricature</a> of Bentham, his bizarre claim that capitalism suppresses individuality, rather than being totally, totally dependent on it - but I didn't resent it because he is so patent about it and because he is funny:

<blockquote>
If the [genetic guesses] about both Victoria and Albert are well-grounded, this means that many of the crowned heads of Europe are descended jointly from an unscrupulous Irish soldier and a German Jew. Given this, it is surprising that these families manifested so few of the talents stereotypically attributed to the Irish and the Jews; such as wit or good looks.

Karl Marx, as so often, made an accurate observation of the political scene and drew a false inference from it.

He loves Disraeli and Albert, hates Gladstone and Palmerston. I have no idea if this is an original position. Got tired of his tone and scattergun of stories about two-thirds in. About as good as popular history that isn't <a href="http://www.fallen.io/ww2/">data-driven</a> can be.

Rally round and settle in, once again, to hear the West’s most popular critic on his specialist subject: the barely recognised crimes of rich democracies. (Note, however, that this isn't really a book: it's a transcript of Chomsky in discussion with someone with even less ideological care than he. Also, the title is cool but misleading, since they don't actually go in to the plausible claim that the West's foreign policy has been terroristic, and since I don't think drones come up at all.) It is selective as history and nearly worthless as economics, but I do not begrudge Chomsky continuing his fifty-year marathon of talking about covert realpolitik: these sorts of manipulations are almost unreported at the time, go wholly unpunished, and are rapidly forgotten. 

Like what? Well, begin with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State#Humanitarian_disaster">Leopold II</a>, skip to the Enola Gay, or Britain's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine_(legal_instrument">Palestine</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">Operation Boot</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_PBFORTUNE">Operation PBFORTUNE</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba#Foreign_involvement_in_his_death">Lumumba</a>, the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/laos/1478626/History-haunts-the-Plain-of-Jars.html">Plain of Jars</a>, and the long systematic atrocity "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor#U.S._involvement">Operation Condor</a>" (involving us and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinochet#U.S._backing_of_the_coup">Pinochet</a>, Noriega and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama">Just Cause</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/28/indonesia.world">Suharto</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War#United_States_involvement">El Salvador</a>), or that Iraq matter.<br /><br />
But even though it handles these real crimes, On Western Terrorism turns out to be an echo-chamber - a mix of apparently detailed research (e.g. they appeal to some 'declassified embassy reports' to back up some claims) and pervasive confirmation bias. 

The main problem's exaggeration. In one breath they move from a righteous skit on the original colonial genocides to a view of world politics in which everything that happens now is the outcome of decisions in Brussels and Washington. From “The West has, historically and recently, been hypocritically violent and anti-democratic” to “Everything bad in the world is due to the West”. That sounds like a sure straw man, but here’s the man himself:

<blockquote>
The great majority of events that were causing the suffering of countless human beings all over the world were related to greed, to the desire to rule and to control coming almost exclusively from the ‘old continent’ and its powerful but ruthless offspring on the other shore.</blockquote>

 (Oh? malaria? dysentery? precarious subsistence farming? Hutu-on-Tutsi genocide?) He’s at it again here:

<blockquote>although it is mostly Rwanda, Uganda who are murdering millions of innocent [Congolese] people, behind this are always Western geopolitical and economic interests.</blockquote>



Well. It's true that, as well as the flat-out murders in the links above, our governments bear shame for ignoring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_war">unbelievably destructive</a> ongoing wars in e.g. the Congo. But failing to prevent murder is not murder, nor necessarily accessory to - especially if we remember that C&V’s judicious attitude to military intervention would have precluded direct action anyway. There is a logical chasm between what one could only perhaps prevent - given enough luck and blood - and what one is the cause of. (I agree that the two situations place similar responsibilities on us, by the way - but in the absence of simple solutions, that hypothetical responsibility does not make them the same.) Similarly: capitalism produces enormous inequality but <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2011$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=0AkBd6lyS3EmpdHo5S0J6ekhVOF9QaVhod05QSGV4T3c;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL%5Fn5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=194;dataMax=96846$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=55;dataMax=108111$map_s;sma=50;smi=2$cd;bd=0$inds=">mostly inadvertently relieves poverty</a>: poverty is our default from before there was a world-system. But C&V and others of the demagogic school persist in blaming all the world's ills on rich bores whose uncaring exploitation often works better for the poor than altruistic direct action. (This is very counterintuitive; so much for intuition.)

Why do I disagree? They say it’s cos I’m a dupe:

<blockquote>There have been very sophisticated propaganda systems developed in the last hundred years and they colonized minds including the minds of the perpetrators. That’s why the intellectual classes in the West generally can’t see it.</blockquote>

 
I say it’s because while their description of our foreign policy is (depressingly) fair, on the foreign policy of rival governments they are uncritical, whitewashing, and on historical alternatives to our type of society they are naive and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_(fallacy">cherry-picking</a>, where they give evidence at all. What might a real radical say in response to my aspersions? "Fuck balance! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ">Balance</a> is what lets them get away with it! Fuck evidence! Evidence is what makes people think I’m wrong!" 

Vltchek is much more skewed than Chomsky. He’s earnest, and clearly devoted to <a href="http://andrevltchek.weebly.com/films.html">first-hand reporting</a> of the abuse of powerless people. But, oddly, depressingly, this immersion in the frontline has robbed him of perspective (and in fact it doesn't get more front-line: he was tortured in East Timor in 1996). He suffers the defining mistake of recent leftism: the enemy of my enemy error, where  you'll approve of anyone who resists the West. In fact, his comments, taken over the whole book, amount to a flirting defence of totalitarianism - he romanticises the Soviets, Assad's Syria, and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report-%5Bscheduler-publish-yyyy%5D/world-report-2014-ecuador">Ecuador</a>. Both of them exchange the Eurocentric rose-tint of our mainstream for lenses warped in the reverse direction. And it all rests, ultimately, on tacit belief in the <a href="http://tomtalkspolitics.wordpress.com/2009/12/07/bertrand-russells-the-superior-virtue-of-the-oppressed/">'superior virtue of the oppressed</a>' - the strange belief that being bombed makes the bomb recipient better than you. (Sure, they’re probably more virtuous than the bombers, but that’s not saying much.) Our governments being awful does not mean that others are not. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization">Quite the reverse</a>.

Also: Chomsky bashes the 'Black Book' of Communism not by challenging its accounting, but by saying that Western capitalism's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque">toll was worse</a> (no footnote, but see the lone India example below); and the Prague Spring is utterly minimised with the same ugly break-a-few-eggs fallacy. Vltchek:

<blockquote>Moscow’s invasion of 1968 to put down the Prague Spring was not necessarily something that should have happened... but there was no massacre performed by the Soviets; few people fell under the tanks. Most of what happened was accidents; some people who died were drunk. </blockquote>


(The direct death toll was 72 plus suicides, if that's what he means.) 

That’s the first big problem. The other huge one is the complete lack of footnotes, even as they make the boldest possible claims. As a result, even I identified some errors in the course of my single superficial reading. (Ok, so some failings are just the vagaries of live dialogue as compared to writing; but Vltchek (or Pluto Press at least) would be forgiven for editing the damn thing for basic evidence.)

The only research cited in support of the claim that capitalism causes more excess death from starvation is Dreze and Sen's reputable 1981 study 'Hunger and Public Action (<a href="http://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/faculty/glasgow/ps15/DrezeSen.pdf">p.214 here</a>). C&V use this to compare excess deaths in India (as an instance of a market democracy) in 1947-1979 with that of Communist China, pointing out that Dreze and Sen place the toll in India at some 100 million, next to China’s '25-30' million. (First cockup: citing thirty-year-old research underestimates the toll of Mao’s famine by perhaps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao's_Great_Famine#Criticism">20m people</a>.) But the comparison doesn't do the work they put it to (that is, condemning capitalism): India was almost an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarkic">autarkic</a> <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS022.pdf&rct=j&frm=1&q=&esrc=s&sa=U&ei=CjO8U875JIjsOoKzgMAB&ved=0CBQQFjAA&sig2=jPPsJmQt057fqArKrMJ3kg&usg=AFQjCNGPlxtds0U9r_FEXHEoKaHEaeiSuA">command economy</a> (in which perhaps two-thirds of all formal, non-subsistence employment was public-sector) in that period; it does not serve them as an exemplar of neoliberal starvation. 

Even if it did, we would again come up against their curious equation of failure to prevent an intractable thing with causing the thing in the first place. As far as I can tell, their reasoning really is: “Capitalism exists, and poverty exists, so, capitalism causes poverty.” But it would take one of two things for capitalism to be responsible for poverty: causation, as evidenced by e.g. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/06/economist-explains-0">a gross increase</a> in the number of poor people under its penumbra; or its impeding a more effective solution to poverty. But the proportion of (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty#Absolute_poverty">utterly</a>) poor people, in this supremely Late-capitalist world is the lowest it has ever been; and the remaining poverty is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_Billion">not at all simple to fix</a>; and capitalist countries really did try, throwing <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/23/aid_amnesia">enormous amounts of money and thought</a> at the problem for going-on 70 years. 

To be responsible for poverty in the way C&V say, either capitalism or old socialism would have to be omnipotent, and - among other fairly strong disconfirmations for that idea - the 20th century shows both of those to be untrue. (The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Chomsky-book-a-best-seller-after-Chavez-speech-2469244.php">commercial success</a> of Chomsky in his enormously capitalist society, is an extra data point toward rubbishing any strong statement about capitalism's mind-control powers.)

(Vltchek talks about global warming briefly, and I was about to reach for the <a href="http://www.rtcc.org/2012/03/12/kiribati-president-rejects-climate-change-evacuation-stories/">recent debunking</a> of claims of Polynesian evacuation – but in fact it turns out his sources were better; the president of Kiribati has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/01/kiribati-climate-change-fiji-vanua-levu">since publicly floated</a> a national evac plan.)

A less straightforward quibble: they think this book is about the West, I think it’s about humans with power.

I had believed Chomsky more humane than this talk makes him seem (see for example his <a href="http://www.spectrezine.org/global/chomsky.htm">sombre 90s piece</a> on the Black Book) - that is, I want to pin the blame for this biased and maudlin tract on Vltchek. But <a href="http://www.monbiot.com/2012/05/21/see-no-evil/">his long-standing dismissal</a> of some non-Western massacres at last makes me wonder.

On a less uninspired and dispiriting note: if there is a system less bad than Swedish capitalism, it does not exist in the past. So it must be invented, negotiated, and tested. Chomsky and the other socially enraged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostalgie">ostalgiacs</a> in his ambit are not mostly doing that; <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2013/03/22/on-erik-olin-wrights-envisioning-real-utopias-diane-coyle/">Erik Olin Wright</a> and <a href="http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/a-practical-utopians-guide-to-the-coming-collapse">David Graber</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/feminism-capitalist-handmaiden-neoliberal">Nancy Fraser</a> and others are at least trying.

Finally, what’s so bad about being excessive and dogmatic in your criticism of awful things? (Why should anti-oppression efforts need to justify themselves? They're anti-oppression!) Well, apart from it being dangerous and ignoble to be so firmly wrong, taking this tack means that your true conclusions will be dismissed as just more of your typical excesses. 

But even given their slips, hyperbole, and complacency, there’s no way around some of C&V's key claims: Our governments have not in general been a positive force in the rest of the world; this is not well-known within our societies; as long as <a href="https://www.globalpolicy.org/us-un-and-international-law-8-24/us-opposition-to-the-icc-8-29.html">the US is</a> <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/490/united-states-and-the-icc">legally immune</a> from prosecution, international justice is a joke; we have often given money and guns to the worst people in the world; we did this for little more than control and for stuff.

A.J. Jacobs (2007)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2015<br>
<br>
The Old Testament has roughly 700 rules of varying severity and absurdity; Jacobs tried to follow all of them for a year. For a host of reasons, this can't be done, and so this is a reductio of biblical literalism. It is also a sympathetic anthropology of the literal Other Side, who are low-status, even in parts of America. 

*<li>The mad rules: never wear mixed fibres; no rubber tires; burning a red cow is the only way to be pure person; all the precise shabbat rules about what you can and can't do; basically anything involving women. Judaism actually has a specific word for the arbitrary, stupid divine laws: the <a href="http://www.chabad.org/search/keyword_cdo/kid/14032/jewish/Browse-by-Subject.htm">chukim</a>. The various brilliant, witty cafeteria theists he consults are open about them being silly tests - fun puzzles, even.</li>

* <li>The blatantly evolutionary / patriarchal rules: no other gods before me, no shellfish, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm">modest women</a>. </li>

* <li>He is keen to show the noble side to the real literalists: they practice tithing, pacifism, no hell, are activists for global debt jubilee. (A handful of lovely policies out of the mad and thoughtless other 700, mind you.) One group are even admirable on epistemic, philological grounds!: "You can't follow all of the Bible literally because we can't know what some of the words mean." Sure they take this to be a reason to be even more extreme than ever stipulated, just to be safe, but I admire the rigour of it.</li>
</ol>

An extremely open-minded man; he meets the Creation Museum people, and the Amish, and the snake handlers. I didn't like the constant stream of cheap gags or his wielding family details for padding. I def didn't like his earnest attempt to use cognitive dissonance to delude himself into theism:

<blockquote>
The notion of obeying laws that have no rational explanation is a jarring one. For most of my life, I've been working under the paradigm that my behavior should have a logical basis. But if you live biblically, this is not true. I have to adjust my brain to this.
...

When I first read the parable of the prodigal son, I was perplexed. I felt terrible for the older brother. The poor man put in all these years of loyal service, and his brother skips town, has a wild good time, then returns, and gets a huge feast? It seems outrageously unfair.

But that's if you're thinking quantitatively. If you're looking at life as a balance sheet.
There's a beauty to forgiveness, especially forgiveness that goes beyond rationality. Unconditional love is an illogical notion, but such a great and powerful one.
</blockquote>


(That simply strikes me as choosing to be mistaken and then hardening oneself to injustice.) 


He is not quite sophisticated enough to pull off rigorous naturalist wonder fully (but again this is me cruelly comparing a journalist to Nietzsche, Pessoa, Gopnik). But the following affirmation of mythos here is more or less my view:

<blockquote>
I'm still agnostic. But in the words of Elton Richards, I'm now a reverant agnostic. Which isn't an oxymoron, I swear. I now believe that whether or not there's a God, there is such a thing as sacredness. Life is sacred. The Sabbath can be a sacred day. Prayer can be a sacred ritual. There is something transcendent, beyond the everyday. It's possible that humans created this sacredness ourselves, but that doesn't take away from its power or importance. 
</blockquote>




Literalism is impossible, immoral and inconsistent with our new, better picture of the world; biblical liberalism is mercenary and inconsistent with itself. So don't bother?

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15917028">"Why Your Five-Year-Old Could Not Have Done That: From Slashed Canvas to Unmade Bed, Modern Art Explained"</a></h3>

Susie Hodge (2012)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2015<br>
<br>
An attempted defence of the current reigning artistic paradigm: low-skill, high-concept, contemptuous of past, audience, and self; identitarian. Call it anaesthetic conceptualism. It is also a nice illustrated catalogue of some recent objects that have managed to piss various people off. 150 years ago, we direly needed people to make art larger, to stand against the Academic approach of Nice Hard Mimesis Only. The problem is that since the 50s many artists replaced that shallow spectacle of mere mimetic skill with the even shallower spectacle of empty originality and flashy cynicism. This book has such a patronising presentation; it could have been named "How to explain conceptualism to your five year-old". (I guess that could have been an intentional irony, but to me it just told me what she thinks of anyone sceptical of the trend. But some kudos for being clear, since this makes the hollowness of her points blatant.)

I have to applaud her; unlike the rest of her curator peers, she has at least attempted to justify a gigantically expensive, creativity-draining, status-hogging practice with close readings. I should also thank her for tacitly admitting that the only hermeneutics that can justify anaesthetic conceptualism is a small-minded and super-conservative intentionalism (i.e. 'what matters about the work is what the artist meant').* "It doesn't really matter how the object looks; what really matters is how deep the creator was and how much history you can project on it." But this philosophy of art is convincing to no-one not already invested in the great tedious playground. I dislike most of this art, and this way of talking about it, because I want to love art.***

Anyway, this is a useful catalogue of the kind of low-skill pieces that have only recently been possible and that you need to know about to move in certain presumably unbearable circles.

<br>

<blockquote>
* Though the so-called <a href="http://faculty.smu.edu/nschwart/seminar/fallacy.htm">intentional fallacy</a> is not actually a fallacy** - it does not make sense to say that someone is literally mistaken to think that the creator's view of an artwork is the only relevant one, since aesthetic interpretation doesn't admit of literal error - instead it's just an incredibly limited and superstitious philosophy - along the same lines as deontology in ethics. It makes art a small and mostly ancient thing, while aesthetic experience could instead rise to each of the potential billions of minds that come to it, and it always takes place in the present, with entirely novel meanings generated, far beyond the ken of any creator.


** I'm aware that 'fallacy' has found usage outside of its original meaning, 'a failure in logical reasoning'. But the new usage, committed for instance by Beardsley, is something shitey like 'a horrible belief I don't like boo'. I'm generally torn between a descriptive and a prescriptive philosophy of vocabulary, but in this case the bullying and sloppy-mindedness of the new usage makes me deny it outright. Some words are too important to give up. (Mostly epistemology tbf.)

*** This is an unforgivably poncey thing to say, not least because I don't think I really mean it. If crap artists had not usurped a good portion of all the species' attention and reverence, I don't think I'd care what modern art was like. But as it is they are cheaters - even the great ones. They cheat themselves into immortality and perceived profundity via the handy expedient of prettiness and vagueness or ugliness and vagueness. In a way, they and we cheat malaria victims of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/July_2015_United_Kingdom_budget#/Spending">huge sums</a>, while the very people who claim to care about global injustices cheer us dumping more money into it, while saying things like 'life isn't worth living without art'. Well, maybe it wouldn't be, but life is not worth living if you're dead either, and <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Culture%20is%20not%20about%20Esthetics">there is enough art already</a>.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29579">"Foundation (Foundation, #1)"</a></h3>

Isaac Asimov (2004)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2022<br>
<br>
The face that launched a thousand woolly research programmes.

The only interesting thing about psychohistory is its contrast with social science. Both are admittedly the exquisite products of a decadent and vastly powerful empire. Both give a pretext to social engineers. But psychohistory works, and it’s interesting to consider why social science doesn’t. 

Part of it is the distinction between real science and the cargo cult kind:

<blockquote>“It amounts to a diseased attitude—a conditioned reflex that shunts aside the independence of your minds whenever it is a question of opposing authority. There seems no doubt ever in your minds that the Emperor is more powerful than you are, or Hari Seldon wiser. And that’s wrong, don’t you see? … “It isn’t just you. It’s the whole Galaxy. Pirenne heard Lord Dorwin’s idea of scientific research. Lord Dorwin thought the way to be a good archaeologist was to read all the books on the subject—written by men who were dead for centuries. He thought that the way to solve archaeological puzzles was to weigh the opposing authorities. And Pirenne listened and made no objections” </blockquote>


As well as the distinction between "scientific" socialism and actual science.

Can you think of a better way to doom a project than to convince its leadership that success is inevitable?

Nice touch: to make his forecast stable, Seldon has to impose a simple structure on his subjects - to predict by forcing the world to become predictable. (“That which is unstable we shall control.”)

One of Asimov’s vices is too closely allying intelligence and virtue. You can always tell a turncoat in this - before he turns - by his being a bit dim. Another is the repetitiveness and cliche of his historical cycles. He has the peripheral worlds turn to literal feudalism (“strange world! You have no peasantry”) before the tech Empire has even properly fallen. Seldon’s categories are well-worn and leave no room for social development and the weird shapes people grow into. The schlock religion which takes over the educated sector in less than 30 years was also pretty dumb.

Clumsy prose, almost entirely free of imagery. Identikit characters, largely smug. Starts weakly, ends abruptly in artless and pulpy fashion. Tune in next week.

<blockquote> When the San Jacinto was thrusting – which was most of the time – “down” was toward the drive, giving the ship’s interior a layout like a tower, with multiple, narrow decks. From the crew’s perspective, the ship was perpetually headed up, toward a location above their heads. San Jacinto’s usual cruise thrust was ten milligees and change, enough so something dropped would eventually hit the floor, but below the threshold of providing any sensation of weight?</blockquote>



His 2100s are probably not weird enough though. And there are wormholes and some other barely physical conveniences (helium-3 as economical fusion material). Overall it reads as an Exercise, an etude, a slightly hollow extrapolation of a world with some nice archetypes running around inside it.

Stephen Grosz (2014)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2013<br>
<br>
Neat, sad, surprising, overcoming my strong prior against psychoanalysis. A series of polished case studies illustrating the wide variety of ways we can be broken-down and knotted-up. 

Settles into a pattern: 'difficult patient’s puzzling actions are to be explained by a timeless subversion - thus, praise can be destructive, pain is vitally informative, spitting in people’s faces can be a defence mechanism', etc. 

He’s honest about the questionable utility of his field – he doesn’t seem to help many of these people, let alone cure them – and this makes the book ok.

Important topic – tracking the fast rise of one-tenant housing just as soon as a country becomes rich enough, tracing the ideological roots of normative pairing, looking at chimps and orangutans and showing the large caveats in the research that claims that married people are on average happier. 

But that’s all covered in the preface, and Klinenberg’s prose is canting and repetitive – after chapter 4 I could not stand any more of his interviewees’ corporate self-conceptions and language (“I needed this in order to grow as a person”). It is wholly cool and righteous to live alone; talking about it this way is revolting.

<blockquote>I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of.</blockquote>

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68rXwBtNsy8">St Vincent</a>

<blockquote>Today artificial intelligence and information technologies have absorbed many of the questions that were once taken up by theologians and philosophers... All the eternal questions have become engineering problems.</blockquote>

 [I wish]

A journalist's conception of philosophy; surprisingly little to do with technology so much as the scientific revolution / Darwinian revolution / fall of religion and the philosophical anxiety it continues to cause metaphysics-<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10177384-man-your-head-is-haunted-you-have-wheels-in-your">haunted</a> people. Freshman philosophy of mind plus relentless insinuation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulverism">bulverism</a>. If you don't have a philosophy background you'll get some understanding of the history and the received concepts, even as your understanding of AI, transhumanism, simulationism, and rationality will suffer. 

Her constant psychoanalysis and genealogy of positions which deserve actual responses robbed me of any pleasure in it. I think she engages with the arguments maybe twice (when she dismisses Turing's cute hypothetical argument about AI souls, and when she dismisses concerns about <a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/principles-for-the-application-of-human-intelligence/">human bias</a> by saying that human decisions are trustworthy because they are human, "we can assume it falls within the realm of human thought processes"). The rest of the time she just notes that if you squint these new ideas look like those old ideas, and you don't like those old ideas do ya. She does it to her bleedin husband, who she could just ask:

<blockquote>Clearly the very notion of the [robot] dog had provoked in him some kind of primal anxiety about his own human exceptionality</blockquote>

 Or he just doesn't like fake things!!

She rejects transhumanism on the grounds of illegitimate birth, along with many-worlds QM, simulationism, and the semiscientific consciousness theories of Koch and Tononi. But this is a simple fallacy: Teilhard did a religious version of transhumanism, and Kurzweil did a nonreligious version. This fact says little about the validity of Kurzweil's ideas. You have to actually argue against things you want to dismiss!!!

<blockquote>Had I been acquainted with this history during the years I was immersed in transhumanism, I might have had reason to doubt its visions of transcendence...

I had always wondered whether [Everettian] scenarios were not merely desperate attempts to get rid of the perceiving subject...

[Bostrom] belonged to a long lineage of creationist rhetoric that invoked human technologies to argue that the universe could not have come about without the conscious intention of a designer.</blockquote>

 Belonged to??

<blockquote>All of the authors were men, and I was surprised by how often they acknowledged the deeply personal motivations that led them to their preferred theories of mind. Two of them, in a bizarre parallel, listed among these motivations the desire to leave their wives... Reading these books within a single week nearly eradicated my faith in the objectivity of science... How much of our science and philosophy has been colored by the justifications of shitty men?</blockquote>

 Adultery exists, therefore science is not possible. Origen’s conception of the eidos something something something something.

A funhouse mirror of reason, in which similarity in one aspect is contagious, taints the whole system of ideas. It is not enough to reject Christianity, one must also flee superstitiously away from anything which vaguely resembles it. Did you know that the poet/theologian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_of_Thrace">Linus of Thrace</a> once wrote "There was a time when all the world began at once." Sounds an awful lot like the big bang theory eh? Feeling pretty silly about believing in that big bang ain't ya.

: A sufficiently intelligent theologian can contrive striking religious parallels in fucking anything. This book is a good example.

<blockquote>He notes that the mystical strands of Judaism affirm the underlying structure of computer science: “Creating and animating by the manipulation of symbols, which is what computer scientists both do and study, is but one aspect of our being created in God’s image.”</blockquote>


Depressing portrait of the chattering classes:

<blockquote>I live in a university town, a place that is populated by people who consider themselves called to a “life of the mind,” and yet my friends and I rarely talk about ideas or try to persuade one another of anything. It’s understood that people come to their convictions—are in some sense destined to them—by elusive forces: some combination of hormones, culture, evolutionary biases, and unconscious emotional or sexual needs</blockquote>


But she takes certain ideas extremely seriously, chiefly radical scepticism, the god-shaped hole, illusionism, and the nauseous view of the simulation argument. The coolest thing Rodney Brooks ever said:

<blockquote>people tend to overanthropomorphize humans… who are after all mere machines.</blockquote>


Despite her psychologism she is extremely unpragmatic; I mean that as a compliment.

<blockquote>I want to say that theories like Bostrom’s are intrinsically untethering—so much so that even now I cannot consider them in any serious way without beginning to question the very foundations of reality</blockquote>


Still I wish people were not so naive about the supposedly comforting "<a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-trouble-with-re-enchantment/">enchantment</a>" of past ages. People longing for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World">demon haunted world</a>! For blissful ignorance, but then also the bigotry it always caused. God bless Bruno Latour:

<blockquote>How could we be capable of disenchanting the world, when every day our laboratories and our factories populate the world with hundreds of hybrids stranger than those of the day before? Is Boyle’s air pump any less strange than the Arapesh spirit houses?</blockquote>


She is doing rationalism, scepticism wrong ("rereading Dawkins and Dennett and Sam Harris with the same reverence I’d once reserved for the Church fathers"). You can still have intuitions. You can still take joy in coincidences, why not?<blockquote>When I was still a Christian, these moments were rich with meaning, one of the many ways I believed that God spoke to me, but now they seemed arbitrary and pointless</blockquote>

 Though maybe that's weak sauce once you've had the superstimulus of feeling them to be messages from God.

Rationality also permits the use of words in figurative senses, without this somehow revealing that you are ideologically owned. Her idee fixe is the inescapability and perversity of metaphor (Lakoff's overstated stuff).

<blockquote>I no longer believed in metaphors. All of them, religious or scientific, were treacherous, sullied by human longings...

neuroscientists “commonly use the Neural Computation metaphor without noticing that it is a metaphor"... God help the rest of us, who remain captive to so many dead metaphors, who still refer to the soul casually in everyday speech</blockquote>


I deny the premise: there is nothing wrong with saying that the human visual system (for instance) implements an algorithm. This is not metaphorical, it literally implements it. The brain is a computer, performs computation, just as all physical systems do. It is idiotic to reply "aha! The brain isn't made of silicon! Aha! The brain doesn't have an infinite tape inside! You rube!" Just hasn't heard of the <a href="https://blog.shakirm.com/2013/04/marrs-levels-of-analysis/">levels of analysis</a> I guess.

I'd be less annoyed if she was a consistent positivist or pyrrhonian, but she makes plenty of room for specious stuff:

<blockquote>If something analogous to [dissociative identity disorder] happens at a universal level,” the authors wrote, “the one universal consciousness could, as a result, give rise to many alters with private inner lives like yours and ours.” As harebrained as this might sound, the argument is compelling for technical and philosophical reasons. The DID analogy is a way of solving a longstanding objection to idealism: if we’re all one mind, then why are there limits to our perception...

By 2017 these algorithms had outperformed human radiologists in detecting lung cancer [no], proven faster and more effective than humans in identifying images in photos [sort of], and composed baroque chorales so convincing that professional musicians mistakenly attributed them to Bach [maybe as a fluke]

Within transhumanist thought, transcendence depends on the notion that information can be liberated from the material constraints of the physical world: it is an ideology, as the critic N. Katherine Hayles points out, in which “disembodied information becomes the ultimate Platonic Form [no it doesn't]

New Yorker profile of the venture capitalist Sam Altman reported that two unnamed billionaires are currently funding scientists to figure out how to break us out of the simulation [uh huh]

To some extent, though, the debate about technical explanations and their supposed impossibility is a sleight of hand meant to distract from the real obstacles to transparency, which are legal and economic [weasel word, she means "sometimes" instead of "To some extent"].

What she could not stop thinking about, she said, was the notion that there were a finite number of addicts and thieves in the world at any given moment, and that if she had not stolen the money, another would have sprung up to take her place. The very fact that such predictions were accurate suggested that the conditions of the world were fixed and unchangeable. [begging you to learn about the law of large numbers and error bars]

The model’s grasp of language was so impressive that David Chalmers suggested it might be conscious. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BcuCmf00_Y">he can't totally rule it out</a> is more accurate]

...human behavior is reducible to chemical imbalances and misfiring synapses. Is it naive to grant the mind such power over the body? Is it only in Russian novels that a person is driven to madness after encountering some new philosophy? Why is the only plausible explanation for an obsession the imbalance of neurotransmitters or depressed nerve centers—why could I not have been driven to the same ends by an idea? [no this totally can happen and is not weird because entertaining an idea is just an abstract way to describe a brain state / the "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4104-even-if-there-is-only-one-possible-unified-theory-it">fire</a>" inside the brain state]
</blockquote>

I continue to be confused by how daft Hofstadter is about AI:

<blockquote>"My God, I used to think chess required thought,” he told the New York Times. “Now I realize it doesn’t"</blockquote>


It being fake thought is an axiom for him.

---

Good concept: "reenchantment narratives". Quantum woo, but also transhumanism and AI, which might make it true for the first time.

---

Brilliant attack on so-called "explainable artificial intelligence", almost no one gets this right:

<blockquote>In some cases the explanations come from an entirely different system trained to generate responses that are meant to account convincingly, in semantic terms, for decisions the original machine made, when in truth the two systems are entirely autonomous and unrelated. These misleading explanations end up merely contributing another layer of opacity. “The problem is now exacerbated,” writes the critic Kathrin Passig, “because even the existence of a lack of explanation is concealed.”</blockquote>




---

Deep learning is barely covered, which bolsters my case that this isn't actually a book about AI, it's mostly just marketed that way. She talks about Brooks' emergent modular robotics programme as if it wasn't 20 years dead; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICub">unimpressive successor project</a> she names is 14 years old. <a href="https://say-can.github.io/">SayCan</a> sure makes it seems like he got the entire direction backwards. The success of massive text Transformers is good evidence against militant forms of the embodied cognition hypothesis too.

She is very clear and has little of the sneering I expect from bulverist journalists. I admire her struggle with theism and atheism ("the Book of Job that brought me finally to the brink of doubt. The book is often praised for its literary quality, but once you have been forced to read it literally, it is difficult to see past its fundamental brutality"). The existential and emotional and scientific meaning of AI is a topic in dire need of a book, but not this one.

Ben  Thompson (2012)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Apr 2014<br>
<br>
Rather than dismissing her as just the archetypal religious-conservative idiot, how about treating her as a scared and angry lady who prefigured modern ambivalence about the extremes of our culture? 

OK, so it turns out paying attention doesn’t make her less ridiculous, but she’s certainly no longer alone: moral criticism of pop is an enormous cottage internet industry. Her small-mindedness put her, somehow, on the same lines as nominally compassionate ideology does some of our contemporaries. (The ends meet in the middle?)

Ahem: the actual book. Whitehouse’s letters are just boring, monotonous and prim – the patronising or bureaucratic replies from the BBC or Granada are much more interesting (in which the Establishment stands up for smut). Thomson’s a thorough but overheated curator – for instance when he likens Whitehouse to Lenin because they were each dead good at getting loads of people involved in things. (Call his enthusiasm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument">Golden Hammer</a> Marxism.) Thomson:

<blockquote>
From feminist anti-porn campaigns to UK Uncut, the Taliban, and Mumsnet, Mary Whitehouse's monuments are all around us.
</blockquote>

 

Hrm: she's not the reason people use complaint as a political tool! (Particularly not if you view protest as organised complaint. There is a distinction between complaint and protest - one is the expression of distaste, the other the ascription of injustice - but it's tricky for beasts like us to tell them strictly apart.) Was she the prototype? Yeah, maybe. Luckily for us she lost.

<br>
Why would one want to take away someone’s sense of the ultimate goodness and unity of things – want, that is, to be a New sort of atheist? 

Well, you might have misread history so that religious identity looms as the main cause of violence. Or you might note their continuing key role in keeping heinous oppression going (particularly as regards women and gays). Better, you might view the act of worship as in fact degrading to the worshipper, or see the epistemology implicit in religious practice as an unhealthy and obstructive stance to the world. (Preventing as it does healing doubt and energetic inquiry; outmoded as it is given the better methods at hand.) 

Anyway: Hick of the rearguard talks fairly and at length with a fictional scientistic interlocutor, demonstrating how - if the theist is willing to retreat, ad-hoc, about ten times - scientism actually cannot touch them. 

Amusing example: Hick responds to the solid neurological explanation of religious experience by saying that this is all perfectly consistent with electrical induction in the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/brains/2007/04/spirit_tech.html">right angular gyrus</a> just enabling us to perceive the spiritual world. I like bullet-biting of this magnitude. Hick ends this mostly fair tourney still “as certain as it is possible to be” about God, despite only having parried the critical arguments at great metaphysical cost with deep special pleading. At least his atheist doesn’t convert at the end, as they did in medieval apologetics.

<br>
Gossipy. Says at the start that he isn’t aiming at Hume’s thought or worldview – just his personality, context, happenstance – but since Hume spent a big chunk of his adult life alone thinking, this is quixotic, and Graham predictably does have to go into the Treatise and Essays and Dialogues (and to be frank he does so badly, uncritically). 

This is filled instead with all the bad reviews Hume got, and the clubs he got into, and the middlebrows that quarrelled with him rather than his eternal legacies, i.e. judgment under uncertainty, reason’s motivational inertia, cognitive naturalism, the frailty of natural theology, the kernel of so much modern philosophy. 

The bit on Rousseau as incredible drama queen is good – here is JJ’s reaction to Hume looking at him:

<blockquote> where, great God! did this good man borrow those eyes he fixes so sternly and unaccountably on his friends! My trouble increased even to a degree of fainting; and had I not been relieved by an effusion of tears, I’d been suffocated… in a transport, which I still remember with delight, I sprang on his neck, embraced him eagerly while almost choked with sobbing...</blockquote>

An Analyst metaphysician and a Catholic Medievalist walk into a bar… V&amp;W manage to make light of a thousand years’ semantic drift and logical innovations; so their Anselm turns out to be an ingenious and honest rationalist wrestling with the many millstones of Christian lore. (e.g. Making original sin’s indiscriminate infinite hellfire seem just, making the Trinity seem unavoidable rather than a logical error enforced by state terror.) 

Anselm’s work is a testament to the <a href="http://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2012/06/18/the-hunt-for-the-law-of-infinite-cornucopia/">cornucopaic</a> potential of <a href="http://www.skepdic.com/motivatedreasoning.html">motivated reasoning</a> – a.k.a philosophy, in its middle millennium.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2978800">"Napoleon: The Path to Power"</a></h3>

Philip G. Dwyer (2008)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2019<br>
<br>
How did a "haggard and ghastly" foreigner from a poor-noble family end up ruling two-thirds of Europe, getting one in every 200 people in the world killed (his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars_casualties">namesake wars</a> were the same size, though not the same shape, as the Holocaust), becoming one of the <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/napoleon-was-the-best-general-ever-and-the-math-proves-it-86efed303eeb">most successful generals in history</a>? 

Dwyer's answer is via various sorts of creativity: nepotism, plagiarism, disloyalty, false advertising, ignoring orders (and then going AWOL to avoid reprisal), and but also actual military acumen.

This is true but the broader answer is: with the help of all the revolutionaries whose violence he used. The Corsican freedom fighters, the mob, the fucked-up Jacobins, and the Thermidorians each broke France, creating a ladder of corpses for people like Boney. (This feat is repeated by psychos in most revolutions.) He made general at 26 through an unearned political appointment, and was given absolute command of 63,000 men soon after. 

Dwyer is out to get Napoleon: he sees propaganda everywhere (even in Boney's private diary, aged 18). The whole book is obsessed with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism">Construction</a> of Napoleon - for instance, did you know that when he won a battle, he told people about it expecting praise?  This sentence, or its proposition, is repeated more than a hundred times:

<blockquote>
This encounter [with a prostitute] is taken by most historians at face value, but it is entirely possible that the account is fictional, nothing more than a fanciful exercise of the pen.
</blockquote>


Of course it's possible, but so what? What is its probability? (I continue to read nonfiction which isn't data-driven - more fool me, I suppose.) It's weird to feel annoyed by the hypercritical spirit; I'm usually on the other side of this fence. 

Dwyer is at least jargon-free. And Napoleon certainly lies all the time - to his rivals, his friends, and to posterity. An odd case: both genius and fraud - a genius of dishonesty. (Like Edison?)

Much of this long book is just a prose list of events, many of them insignificant (not to say prurient). There is basically no military detail - most of the major battles get half a page. Fine as reference work maybe.

Misc: 

* I knew that standing armies of the day were rammed full of pillagers, rapists, and thieves, but I was surprised to find that their generals were little better - Napoleon extracted about 80 million francs (maybe half a billion dollars?) from the Italians he conquered, under the name "requisitions". 
(This is many times the tax rate of the previous Austrian occupiers.)

* The many portraits of N are comically dissimilar - simply because done by artists who had never seen him or any image of him.   

* His romantic insecurity is also surprising: he writes to Josephine much more than she replies, and is constantly crestfallen to find her gone without saying where.

* "<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/">Jacobin</a>" is a terrible choice of name for a social justice magazine. It's more like "Khmer Rouge Weekly" or "the Daily Witchfinder" than anything laudable: <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=30EEq8R2feIC&pg=PA617&dq=40000+reign+of+terror&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSgYOtyongAhUkrXEKHUuUBZoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=40000&f=false">~40,000</a> executed or left to rot and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_the_Vend%C3%A9e">a hundred thousand in the Vendée</a>, mostly religious peasants, as well as atrocities like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drownings_at_Nantes">mass slow drownings</a>). The Jacobins deserve some share of Napoleon's millions of dead too - for all that N was only pretending to be a Jacobin. 

Of course, the revolution nominally ended feudalism, redistributed land, and claimed to establish human rights. But we know in hindsight that this could have been done without killing 1% of the country and 0.6% of everyone alive - for instance, it was in Britain, and it was by earlier and later French republicans. So you got some nicer rhetoric in exchange for millions of gallons of blood.   

It suits me to call the Jacobins a perversion of the Enlightenment. This has <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/03/11/steven-pinkers-counter-counter-enlightenment/">lately been characterised</a> as a trick - if it's wrong for Jacobin to cherry-pick the bits they like about the Jacobins (anger, radicalisation, protest marches, beautiful lip-service to egalitarianism) then it's wrong for me to say they're not really part of 'the Enlightenment'. But it is a sick joke of history that Montesquieu's rage at torture, Condorcet's rational politics, and Bentham's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham#Gender_and_sexuality">impressive moral generosity</a> must share a name with these torturing and bigoted totalitarians.

For the artistic director Remeike Forbes who was born in Jamaica, the term refers to the same book... "Bolshevik" would not be bad as a title in fact! Why not, one day...

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13611056">"In Praise of Love"</a></h3>

Alain Badiou (2012)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Oct 2015<br>
<br>
A leftist defence of marriage and a postmodern attempt at making love a big deal, ontologically speaking; beyond this initial frisson of meta-contrarian goodness, though: meh. Book's a bite-sized transcription of a formal literary talk - a genre which may well have no good instance. Here's the solitary pair of beautiful moments in an otherwise lukewarm bath of the history of philosophy of love and lazy sub-systematic Lacanian guesswork*:

<blockquote>
While desire focuses on the other, always in a somewhat fetishist[ic] manner, on particular objects, like breasts, buttocks and cock, love focuses on the very being of the other, on the other as it has erupted, fully armed with its being, into my life that is consequently disrupted and re-fashioned.

Love is an existential project: to construct a decentred world, from a point of view other than that of my mere impulse to survive and re-affirm my own identity... When I lean on the shoulder of the woman I love, and can see, let’s say, the peace of a twilight over a mountain landscape, gold-green fields, the shadows of trees, black-nosed sheep motionless behind hedges and sun about to disappear behind craggy peaks, and know — not from the expression on her face, but from within the world as it is — that she is seeing the same world, and that this convergence is part of the world; that love constitutes precisely, at that very moment, the paradox of an identical difference, then love exists, and promises to continue existing. The fact is she and I are now incorporated into this unique subject, the subject of love that views the panorama of the world through the prism of our difference, so this world can be conceived, be born, and not simply represent what fills my own individual gaze. Love is always the possibility of being present at the birth of the world.
</blockquote>


Clearer prose than you'd expect, though, isn't it?

<blockquote>* e.g. laziness: his claim about there being four "conditions" of philosophy, none of which are in fact necessary conditions, and one of which is good old dyadic love:

<blockquote>Anyone who doesn't take love as their starting-point will never discover what philosophy is about.</blockquote>

Chinua Achebe (2009)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Oct 2013<br>

Title suggests nostalgia for colonialism: you need to know who he is for the gag to work. He waffles a bit, full of avuncular banality more than post-colonial ire. The most shocking bit is about Jim Crow in Africa – up to 1961, black people had to sat behind a partition at the back of the bus, in fucking Zambia.

Francis Su (n)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2022<br>
<br>
<blockquote>A society without mathematical affection is like a city without concerts, parks, or museums.</blockquote>


Something went wrong, that I don't love this book. I think the technical is essential for real intellectual work; normal mind-numbing maths education put me off for years; I thirst for meaning; it's by a teacher at one of the best maths schools in the world (actual best, not just Fancy). But it's essentially a hippie self-help book which got into a university press. I'm surprised it doesn't open by saying namaste to me.

<blockquote>People often think of abstraction as stripping away meaning. But in fact, abstraction does the opposite—it enriches meaning. When you see that two things have similar structures or behavior, then those similarities create a connection, a new meaning for you that wasn’t there before. Poincaré famously said that “mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things".</blockquote>

<blockquote>“make your daughter practice math. She’ll thank you later.”13 The op-ed never asked the question of how to teach math so she’ll thank you now.</blockquote>



The list of values at the back is shockingly poorly conceptualised. But Su is a powerful analyst - just one rule for abstractions and another for humans. (All I want is humanism without sentimental overreach. It's unclear whether I can have this.)

One problem: he is too nice for me. (“Let me start by thanking you, the reader, for taking the time to sit with this book and these ideas. Simone Weil said, “Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity”) It's a very Christian book. Not in its metaphysics: in its intentional naivety, piety, humility, and cuddliness (though Weil and Buber and MacIntyre come up). He is credulous about the findings of educational psychology, including the absurd Pygmalion effect size. Every chapter includes a letter from a maths student in prison, the book ends with a long awkward interview with him, and Su gave some fraction of the royalties to him. One exception: chapter 9, a laudation for power. A huge number of smart people talk as if coercive power was the only sort. They are poisoned by paying too much attention to society.

Years of study have still not given me the virtues Su rightly names - persistence, patience, disposition towards abstract beauty, gaman. Ain't giving up though.

<blockquote>Maryam Mirzakhani... once said: “The beauty of mathematics only shows itself to more patient followers."</blockquote>

 I know.

<blockquote>At my local hiking club, there’s bonding over a shared love of hiking. When it’s time to go, we split into different skill levels to do the hike at various speeds. I have no trouble admitting that I’m a slow hiker” By contrast, in mathematics the joy often requires the skill. </blockquote>


Borcherds made me laugh:

<blockquote>“I was over the moon when I proved the moonshine conjecture. If I get a good result I spend several days feeling really happy about it.</blockquote>

Days!

The puzzles are all nice and can be solved in your head, a good property. But read Rota, Hersch, Taleb, Lockhart, Gardner, Byers for the meat.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Roberts">I like</a> <a href="https://www.csicop.org/si/show/bacteria_ulcers_and_ostracism_h._pylori_and_the_making_of_a_myth">self</a>-<a href="https://www.gwern.net/tags/experiments">experimenters</a> - they risk themselves to give knowledge to, potentially, billions - but the one thing they must have is a sense of the limits of their findings.

This is a hodgepodge of extreme, nominally scientific <a href="http://management.about.com/cs/generalmanagement/a/Pareto081202.htm">Pareto</a> "lifehacks" for: rapid weight-loss, lazy bodybuilding, polyphasic sleep blah, regeneration from chronic injury, DIY female orgasm therapy.  

His conspicuous consumption of medical attention is risible ("Just $3800 four times a year for this battery of vanity tests!"); as is his name-dropping as self-promotion. 

Ferriss has a... creative grasp of biochemistry, and his brute lack of self-doubt lets him be productively provocative (e.g. "I do not accept the Lipid Hypothesis of cardiac disease"; "DO NOT EAT FRUIT"). He quotes heavily from experts, and he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_%28phrase%29">does</a> do everything he advocates. 

The main advantage of him is that he is fearless about ridicule, actually following what he sees as the evidence. Thus there's a long section on the bodybuilding potential of vegetarian diets - which got him lots of scorn from the meathead-o-sphere - as well as an idiosyncratic list of&nbsp;the substrates that vegists&nbsp;are often missing. (Boron, anyone?)

He's pretty fixated on testosterone and infertility. I initially scoffed at his fear of phones irradiating his testicles -&nbsp;but there <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21799142">actually is</a> reason to think so. Not your average loud guru pseud.

Harry Josephine Giles (2021)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Apr 2023<br>
<br>
I'm glad it exists (I'm glad when anyone imagines themselves happy in the far future) but it's too contrived for me. In particular most of the noun translations / calques are overdone kennings ("wantneed" for "waant", "fullbursting" for "pangit" and "codeprogramscripture"). Obviously scifi is full of neologism and funny phonemes, and kenning is a natural way for a logicish intelligence to convey connotation and polysemy. But even very successful scifi prose often feels contrived, even if the novelty skeuomorphism is worth the loss in taste. And this isn't very successful.

One reason I distrust the kennings is that they only go one way. A single Orcadian word leads to a compound English term, and never the reverse. This feels like clumsy bragging about one's ane leid. 

And finally there's the sentiment, the wan Standard Poetic Register of watery hope and fickle gentle/fidge emotionality and belonging. Oddly, the Scots is way less sentimental than the English translation, probably those kennings' fault.

I actually remember Giles from their old poem "Brave" which sadly isn't online.

One day any language we caught in the web will have speakers in space.

Napoléon Bonaparte (2017)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Apr 2013<br>
<br>
Compiled by Honore de Balzac, one wonders how carefully. 

Not very good, mostly.&nbsp;He's obviously&nbsp;<em>truly</em> independent - e.g. there's praise for Muhammad here,&nbsp;lots of fearless anticlerical&nbsp;scepticism, lots of examination of despots. 

He's not coherent at all - he's both an anti-intellectual "man of action"&nbsp;and a shiny-eyed Enlightenment rationalist; Machiavellian bastard and Aristotelian virtue-seeker;&nbsp;imperial elitist and populist revolutionary. Consider: Napoleon&nbsp;caused the deaths of&nbsp;between 3 and 7 million people (i.e. 0.5% of every person alive at the time), imposing significant effects on almost the entire world - and he's a very&nbsp;average writer.&nbsp;Read him next to Nietzsche, who plausibly never harmed anyone in his entire life, but whose writing stills scorches and stuns us. (This gets better when we remember that Nietzsche considered Napoleon one of&nbsp;a handful of people who have been truly&nbsp;'great'.) Charitable reading: We happen to have&nbsp;caught up with Napoleon's thoughts, but not with Nietzsche's.

Nice but repetitive. In one ugly sentence ‘how overlooking intersectionality ruins worldviews and gets folks killed’. He repeats this idea fifty times or so, but it’s a fine one. 

It’s stats-free but I mostly trust him, he’s proved his mastery. “Widespread interest in global inequalities, of which anti-globalization protests are a part, [is the] embodiment of what Hume was talking about in his claim that closer economic relations would bring distant people within the reach of a ‘gradual enlargement of our regards to justice’.”– neat, catching the antithesis in the thesis.

I don’t get on with Sen’s prose: he’s clear and warm but studied in a way that chafes me.

Simultaneously ultra-cynical and ultra-sentimental. The central whim (two kids pledge to marry each other if and only if they succeed in their careers, and to never see each other until then) is hard to swallow. Lots of people outraged by the redpilled monologue on page 80 (“it’s all in the blood... the best thing for a girl is to get married”) but the character is shown as a mouthy prick so maybe a portrayal isn’t a thesis. most of it is po-faced declarations and pondering, not edgy.

Just an A-level English textbook, with good long extracts. English students at my university were taught very little Theory indeed - and while this made discussions much less pompous, they were also kinda toothless.

Slightly crankish popularisation of his work on a mathematical argument of Godel's which maybe demonstrates time's nonexistence (in an ideal system close to General Relativity). 

Yourgrau argues this case using the overlooked friendship between E &amp; G to stir up human interest. He beats the drum a bit hard, taking popularisation to mean "add superlatives and jibes" ("He was a German Jew among WASPS"). 

I get the feeling that Einstein’s in the title more to boost sales / Godel's profile than because the men's relationship is all that critical to the proof Yourgrau thinks has been hushed up or ignored.

Pretty annoying fanfiction. Yalom crowbars Breuer (proto-Freud, the Anna O. guy) into Nietzsche's life, because it would've stretched taste to have Young Freud (pre-Charcot) do it. His is a strange one-dimensional Nietzsche, with none of the real one's lightness, humour, and contempt. (I imagine the portrayal of Breuer is equally simplistic and annoying, but I'm not interested in finding out.)

Much like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2482793876?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">In the Light of What We Know</a>: an oracle and a servant discoursing like desperate teenagers, for hundreds of pages.

He was very ill for most of his life; he wasn't a macho prick in the usual sense, since he poured himself out in letters. Yalom doesn't succeed in porting this outpour.

Edward St. Aubyn (2015)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2018<br>
<br>
Has many of St Aubyn's distinctive virtues - acute black comedy about every social stratum, characters creatively misspending resources, the sometime delight of being exploited, actual knowledge of modern philosophy - but this time it doesn't gel.

The protagonist, Fairburn, writes a book with Patrick Melrose as a character - which invites us to identify Fairburn with St Aubyn. But it doesn't fit very well; Fairburn's life work is meaningless and saccharine. They are both troubled and self-destructive and possibly redeemed I suppose. 

The enframed narrative with Patrick is annoying, and annoyingly this is intentional:

<blockquote>Yesterday Angelique came into the bedroom holding my thin manuscript. She moved towards the open window and I surged up from the pillows shouting, ‘Don’t!’
‘Oh, don’t worry,’ she said, ‘I’m not going to throw it out of the window — that would be doing you a favour.’
‘You don’t like it?’
‘It’s wooden and dry and boring. I can’t believe this is what you want to do with your last days. Why don’t you write about how wonderful the figs taste when you know you may never taste one again?’
‘Because they don’t,’ I said, ‘they taste like ash.’
‘Why don’t you tell us how we must live every moment to the full because life is so precious?’
‘Because if it’s dying that makes you realize that, you’re already too anxious to do anything about it. I wanted to do something serious…’
‘You are doing something serious: you’re dying,’ she said, laughing.
‘Something impersonal.’
‘But that’s exactly the problem: you must make it more personal, more human, more dramatic. You should write from your own experience, write about us... I think the real problem is that you don’t know how to make abstract ideas exciting...’
She left the room and, paralysed by failure and confusion, I watched the breeze scatter the pages across the floor.
</blockquote>


This is a good skewering of upper-middle-class / academic conceit:

<blockquote>The warden’s sly, pedantic chuckle seemed to reverberate among the bookshops and gargoyles that guarded the taxi rank; his gurgling complacencies soaked the golden buildings until they split open like soggy trifle. Perhaps they had once been intended for something serious, but there had been too many puns, too many Latin tags, too many acrostics, too many fiendish crossword puzzles, too many witty misquotations and too many sly chuckles for them to do anything but rot, however noble and solid they might look to the winking eye of a tourist’s camera.
</blockquote>



Many, many different ideas about consciousness show up appear, from the zany (Penrose and Sheldrake) to the canonical (Colin McGinn and Galen Strawson). The stuff on Penrose and Sheldrake is accurate, in the weak sense that it describes their positions correctly. Sadly it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_mysterianism">mysterianism</a> that wins over Patrick / Charlie. The conclusion is roughly a celebration of the mere manifest image, quietism, Wittgenstein's gallic shrug. It manages to miss the point of scientific interest in consciousness, and underestimate the progress it's made already:

<blockquote> I saw the latest cluster of books to emerge from the great consciousness debate: Emotional Intelligence, The Feeling Brain, The Heart’s Reasons. I felt the giddy relief of knowing that I wasn’t going to read any of them. The fact that science has decided to include emotion in its majestic worldview seems about as astute as an astronomer discovering the moon.
</blockquote>



Oh well. Plenty of cynical goodness besides. For instance, I have felt the following emotion, back when I didn't have the spine to refuse to go clubbing:

<blockquote>   I sat down on a velvet bench and through all the smoke and the bad music and the undesirable desire I suddenly allowed myself to become relaxed. Even here there was no need to posture. The essential question remained the same. Where could I find freedom in this situation? I looked around and felt reconciled with all the people in Alessandro's party and all the people in the room. I could spray adjectives at them for the rest of the evening, but in the end they were just people struggling to be happy with only the most unpromising material at their disposal.

Sullen Objectivist / parapsychologist rant, aimed at convincing someone to give her £10m (“Considering how much there is to be done in this subject, that much would be reasonable”). Somehow this blared forth from elite trappings, Hamish Hamilton. Behold her ancient sneer:

<blockquote>In the early days of psychical research, that is to say, during the short period before the volume of activity in the subject petered out on account of the decline of civilisation...</blockquote>


Chapter 1 is “The Decline and Fall of Civilisation”. 6 and 7 get the declines of physics and medicine out of the way in 22 pages. Chapter 14: “Psychokinesis”. Chapter 17: “Conclusion, for the Particular Attention of Millionaires”. So I admit I picked this up to laugh at it: the first page has Green declare herself an unappreciated genius, followed by pages of mostly inapt aphorisms:

<blockquote>When people talk about ‘the sanctity of the individual’ they mean ‘the sanctity of the statistical norm’.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Women are the last people to entrust with children. Those who have repressed their own aspirations will scarcely be tolerant of the aspirations of others.</blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23120225">"The Establishment: And How They Get Away with It"</a></h3>

Owen   Jones (2014)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2016<br>
<br>
Begins very well:

<blockquote>

'The Establishment' is a term that is often loosely used to mean "people with power whom I object to".
</blockquote>


But this awareness didn't immunise him to self-service: instead of writing a book about just "the people with power", or "people who abuse their power", he focusses on one sort: the many cronies and neoliberals that cling to the country's upper reaches. The Jonesian Establishment consists of: fiscally conservative think tanks (but not powerful fiscally liberal ones); Old Boy MPs (but not originally working-class ones, however much they use the same revolving doors); the news media (but not himself, with <a href="https://twitter.com/OwenJones84?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">500,000</a> followers); the police; all corporate bosses; anything to do with the City. 

This is only a problem because of his choice of term, which implies that his description covers all the powerful in Britain. (A big omission, for instance, are the unions. Unite and Unison have extremely <a href="https://www.lgcplus.com/prime-minister-restores-tuc-meetings/1501606.article">frequent</a> meetings with the most powerful politicians in the country - quite rightly - and have an incredibly strong role in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/unite-union-boss-len-mccluskey-threatens-to-launch-party-to-rival-labour-9231266.html">selecting some of those people</a> - quite dubiously. They sometimes use this power against the public interest, e.g. GMB propping up Trident. But they are not Establishment to Jones.*) 

He is thinking clearly, and that's half the work in finding the truth, which is half the work in changing the world. But, above the level of reporting individual events, he is just not empirically reliable: he notes that the Sun has 3m readers and just assumes that this means they are all-powerful in elections. Actually the (British, C21st) media has <a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/news/2015/april/newspapers-influence-election">little effect</a> on election outcomes - <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.570.64&rep=rep1&type=pdf">they produce only</a> <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~chri3110/Details/Sun%20paper.pdf">1-2% swings</a>.**

A more general problem: Jones has a fundamentally moral conception of society's problems: "the poor primarily suffer because of the greed or cowardice or ignorance of our rulers. Nationalisations and the £20 minimum wage would have no real downside." This is as opposed to the engineering conception, which sees the constraints, tradeoffs, and tries to design solutions with these in mind.

Still, my sympathies are with people who get attacked on both sides of a war, as Jones often does - for being both naively idealistic about economics and democracy, and insufficiently radical and obedient to the party line. He bears some millstones, like his totally unanalysed use of the Left/Right divide (he prefaces every single bloody interview with bloody anyone with a binary tag, one way or the other).

Anyway this is fine as very recent political history. (If you were paying attention to politics during the Noughties, then you maybe won't learn much new here, but it's a great primer for the foreign or young.) I was angry afterward, so clearly he is effective at his chosen task; god knows if political anger is what we need though. (I read a lot of non-data-driven nonfiction, god knows why. Maybe so my anger can be relevant at least, or in preparation for pseuds' dinner parties.) 



* (I also wish he'd stop capitalising the damn word all the time.)

** A belief in the brain-washing power of the media - to change voting behaviour, to instil sexism, to desensitize us to violence - is one of the defining quirks of the modern hard left, despite there being decent counter-evidence against each effect. Percipi est esse.

New Atheism peaked when I was about 16, the peak age for insufferable overconfidence. So credit to my dumbass teenage self for picking this, an adversarial collaboration that heard out the Christian. In fact, the Christian is the editor, and gives himself the final word. (I probably only read it cos I'm a massive BR fanboy, though.)

It's nothing special - neither Jones nor Graffin are very original at apologetics / unapologetics (compared to say Lane Craig or Hitchens or Dennett).

Eh. I haven't thought about religion in years, and thank god for that.

Brilliant man with a peerless anti-authoritarian anti-pomp streak. But this is hagiography, presenting his good puns as profundities and his bad puns as good puns.

<br>
Surprisingly bland, sturdy. No drugs, for instance. But actually this is well and good - a stable life being very helpful in the production of the wild and new. Lots and lots of name-dropping, which I feel is included for our benefit rather than his; "ah, yes, recognise that one, ok".

He endorses something that I, a sheltered western European, have previously felt about America, but which I assumed was a ridiculous exaggeration:

<blockquote>
  Disembarking in Southampton, I remember... feeling, for the first time in my life, totally safe - safe from people who might want to hit me, or do things to hurt me...

  one of the weird things about America is the feeling you get there that if someone doesn't approve of you, there's a good chance they're going to pop you one. It's probably just that go-getter American attitude which dictates that guys who don't like you feel they have to do something about it... I've to ascribe it to the fact that people in England seem to have a much better sense of personal space... They don't feel entitled to invade your territory the way Americans do - perhaps they just scratched that itch with the whole British Empire thing.
</blockquote>



I was intrigued to learn that Brando was a compulsive consequentialist:

<blockquote>
  I said the only way to get [Brando] was to... tell him we'd pay him $2 million, but only if we could give the money direct to the American Indians. I think we would've got him that way, because his own moral scheme would have left him no option but to accept.
</blockquote>


The first thing about him I like.

Here is one real hallucination:

<blockquote>
...people will often be telling me that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnon_Milchan#Intelligence_operative">my producer</a> is a bit of an operator, and my reply to them is generally "Well, that may very well be true, but I'm only interested in one thing, and that's getting the film done - whether or not I get screwed in the process"... we got two films made together, and no amount of documentaries about his pivotal role in the Israeli nuclear weapons programme can change that.

Surprisingly tame (it's the Thatcher assassination book). It doesn't try to justify or politicise his plan; nor is he particularly ill. The target could be anyone, even as the gags are totally time-bound. He's just bored and unhappy, and much less lyrical than the names he drops, Holden Caulfield or Rimbaud.

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9812688/">The Crown</a>, of all things, has a much more searching and serious critique of Thatcher than Grant Morrison the radical. (Though it's also made-up.)

Jodorowsky is a visionary, but a cheap one. ("technopope" indeed!) While Moebius is cheap in the good sense: quick, democratic, direct. AJ's writing really drags this down. Even so, there's a lot of "The Fifth Element" and "Idiocracy" in it: camp, ham futurism.

Reading this after Transmetropolitan and The Filth makes its wild whimsies seem tame though.

Read while passing time in someone else's house.

Lots of detail about Kubrick's brutal whims and maniacally hands-on approach to everything. (In preproduction he threw the bones into the air and filmed the arc himself, apparently, nearly giving himself a head injury.) They both come across as two quite silly men with odd amounts of access to astronauts and presidents and captains of industry.

I was expecting to see something about <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/01/close-tears-he-left-intermission-how-stanley-kubrick-upset-arthur-c-clarke">Clarke's dismay</a> (at working for several years at something essentially discarded), but he totally kept it out of this.

Most of this is deleted scenes from the novel. They're very thin and discardable.

Alastair Reynolds (2018)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Oct 2020<br>
<br>
Both rushed and too long. Characters do lots of excessively dumb stuff, including the most sober and clever characters, Dreyfus and Aumonier, who both act like Maverick badasses here. The contrivance at the beginning (to artificially promote Ng and concoct some drama with Sparver) is too transparent. Way too many board meetings with people doing an increment of exposition and muttering darkly.

There is another scary exponential problem, but unlike in the last book, halfway through it gets capped at 2000 potential deaths. Intentionally small stakes can be good (see Cibola Burn from the Expanse series), but here it just sends up the emoting and silliness from previously professional agents.

Still readable, but it undermines the characters that made the first pop.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33414018">"At the Strangers' Gate: Arrivals in New York"</a></h3>

Adam Gopnik (2017)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2020<br>
<br>
Gopnik is one of the best writers alive, in the limited sense that his prose is unerring and musical, that he can make any subject interesting for twenty minutes. But this book, about being young, poor, and dizzily romantic in 80s New York, is too thin, 90% style. I don't resent reading about him and his wife hanging around department stores, nor even the long passage praising his wife, but I also don't take away anything beyond the mouthfeel of his words.

In some sense their impractical romanticism - spending their last savings on one fancy suit, appreciating graffiti, lingering around Bloomingdale's not buying anything - was straightforwardly aspirational and material. Not bohemian, or, temporarily, on the way up, merely waiting to become an aesthete and, glory of glories, a tastemaker. This is the great tension of arty people, particularly if (as the Gopniks do not) you have pretensions to moral superiority: really you are rejecting one consumerism for another. Book people get away with this most, because the sensuality and pleasure of great writing is hidden between the covers. One solution is to get into high-status trash (you can't be accused of narrow sensualism for liking Tracey Emin or Billy Childish); far more common is to contort yourself so that liking and buying art is a moral action, if not a cleaner and more beautifully non-instrumental kind of moral action than merely doing something for someone.

<blockquote>
It’s human nature to turn a mouth taste into a moral taste—to make a question of how something feels in your mouth into a question of what it says about your world. That’s the basis of every dietary law. When we imagine God, we don’t imagine him indifferent to appetite. No, we imagine him enraged and enraptured by what we’re eating—he tastes bacon and declares it bad and tastes matzo and can hear a whole heroic history when he breaks it. Every mouth taste instantly becomes a moral taste. And so when we need to fight—and no marriage can survive without some useful friction—we fight about food...

The restaurants of New York enraptured me—we didn’t go to any, but I loved the idea of them. I would lie in bed, after we unrolled and enwrapped the “triple fold” sofa every night, and read what was then the premier guide to New York dining out, Seymour Britchky’s The Restaurants of New York... It’s a vanished tone now, in the age of mass amateur reviews on Open Spoon or Table Talk or whatever the current forum is called. (“I took my honey here for birthday dinner, and—wow!—what a blowout. Five stars, for sure.”)

At the time, though, his criticism... seemed thrilling in the power of its sneering, the certitude of its exclusions. The power critic of this kind depends on the lightning turns of his contempt and his favour: no one should ever be sure where he would land, or on whom.
</blockquote>



Note the smooth way in which a cool irreverent idea - "It’s human nature to turn a mouth taste into a moral taste" - becomes a certain precept "Every mouth taste instantly becomes a moral taste" just by lightness and repetition. This is the downside of being this good at prose: you can make things sound simpler than they are.

The humour is ever-present but vanishingly slight. When he loses his only pair of suit trousers, he devotes five pages to a comic lament for them. But it's the echo of comedy.

<blockquote>
I've never recovered them. Because the truth is that what we learn in New York is that a piece of plywood will never protect you from the wild, and that and that suit trousers, once lost, are lost forever. The city makes you the opposite of the emperor with the new clothes. He walked around unclothed, and everyone noticed but him. In New York, you walk around naked from the waist down for decades, and nobody knows but you.
</blockquote>



There are still three or four wonderful points, the best of the New Yorker's shallow profundity

<blockquote>
The idea of the cash machine, which now seems either self-evident or dated, seemed exciting then. Cautiously withdrawing thirty-five dollars at a time from our tiny fund, and doing it first at the Chase machine on Third Avenue but soon at cash machines all over town... we came into a different daily relation to money than our parents had done. My grandparents had belonged to a check-cashing generation, proud to be engaged in it. To have an institution as large as an American bank in effect endorse their signature on a little bit of paper as equivalent to money meant to be taken seriously as a citizen. My parents, in turn, were credit card cultists – they loved having them, signing them, showing them, using them. For those who came of age in the boom times after the Second World War, the whole notion of credit, of sharing in a limitless improving future – of being trusted to buy now and pay later, since later would be so much richer than now – had some of the same significance that the notion of being trusted with checks had for my grandparents.

We, in turn, generationally, had regressed, I realized back into a cash economy – we used checks just to pay the utilities. The machines were one more instrument of that infantilization; we went to the machines for something that felt, at least, like our allowance.

<br>
Flickers between the Classical general and the wattle-byre specific. All really personal – but not in the universally interesting melodramatic way. It is personal in the way that hanging around the vestibule of a friend of a friend of a friend’s house when one didn’t know they were dropping past and one quite needs the toilet is personal. Also, it’s full up with the (apparently haute Irish?) obsession with Attic Greece. One or two amazing ones – see “Amelia’s Poem” :

<blockquote> Amelia, your newborn name
 Combines with the midwife’s word
 And, like smoke from driftwood fires
 Wafts over the lochside road
 Past the wattle byre – hay bales
 For ponies, Silver and Whisper –
 Between drystone walls’ river-
 Rounded moss-clad ferny stones,
 Through the fenceless gate and gorse
 To the flat erratic boulder
 Where otters and your mother rest,
 Spraints black as your meconium,
 Fish bones, fish scales, shitty sequins
 Reflecting what light remains.

Decent mind candy, quick work. 80% of it is pretty much one intermittent action sequence.

The only literary flourish is the protagonist constantly trying to distract himself - from a sheer drop, from the prospect of assailants above, from his culpability, from his impotence.

Necromunda (focussing on the under-underclass of a world-city) is much less Gothic, mystical, triumphal than the usual 40k stuff. But still nasty, unredeemed, temporary, claustrophobic.

QI (n)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Oct 2017<br>
<br>
Violent twee parables about software development. Generally overwrought, and you can get them in a minute or two each time, unlike the bizarre original koans, which demand convoluted confabulation.

But 'Codeless Code' is an instance of an important genre: the romanticisation of the highly abstract and novel. We need such things; otherwise those of us without internal wellsprings of meaning will find it boring, and will thus never excel; otherwise a culture will never grow, and nothing human lasts without growing a culture. There is enough art, except regarding new matters, new concepts, new possibilities, where there is nowhere near enough. 

"Ah!", you say, "But Yudkowsky <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/p1/initiation_ceremony/">did just this</a>, and got roundly mocked and called a <a href="https://ironicalcoincidings.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/the-cult-of-bayes/">cult leader</a> and divers other bad things." Yes: that is the main tax we pay to be on the internet. I think of Yudkowsky as George Eliot thinks of Carlyle (though she hated him btw):

<blockquote><blockquote>
...the highest aim in education is analogous to the highest aim in mathematics, namely, to obtain not results but powers, not particular solutions, but the means by which endless solutions may be wrought. He is the most effective educator who aims less at perfecting specific acquirements than at producing that mental condition which renders acquirements easy, and leads to their useful application...

On the same ground it may be said that the most effective writer is... he who rouses in others the activities that must issue in discovery, who awakes men from their indifference to the right and the wrong, who nerves their energies to seek for the truth and live up to it at whatever cost... he clears away the film from your eyes that you may search for data to some purpose. He does not, perhaps, convince you, but he strikes you, undeceives you, animates you. You are not directly fed by his books, but you are braced as by a walk up to an alpine summit, and yet subdued to calm and reverence as by the sublime things to be seen from that summit.  Such a writer is Thomas Carlyle. 

It is an idle question to ask whether his books will be read a century hence: if they were all burnt as the grandest of Suttees on his funeral pile, it would be only like cutting down an oak after its acorns have sown a forest. For there is hardly a superior or active mind of this generation that has not been modified by Carlyle’s writings; there has hardly been an English book written for the last ten or twelve years that would not have been different if Carlyle had not lived... The extent of his influence may be best seen in the fact that ideas which were startling novelties when he first wrote them are now become common-places. And we think few men will be found to say that this influence on the whole has not been for good... </blockquote>

Overambitious pop science from a lively and charming narrator. He tries to sketch all of machine learning in a couple hundred pages. The warmth of his teaching voice comes through the page:

<blockquote>
As you read the book, feel free to skim or skip any parts you find troublesome; it’s the big picture that matters, and you’ll probably get more out of those parts if you revisit them after the puzzle is assembled.
</blockquote>


but he needs a better editor, more even than Nassim Taleb does. This is often just a stream-of-consciousness analogy-dump, and with precise topics that just doesn't fly. (Both Penguin productions.) 

There's more wrong with it than prose, unfortunately: he gives equal time to unpromising approaches (genetic programming, analogical reasoning) and so has to skim over the single most important approach (deep learning), with no real sense of the giant differences in success. Couple this with his terrible argument against AI risk ("unlike humans, computers don’t have a will of their own. They’re products of engineering, not evolution... the evaluation function is determined by us. A more powerful computer will just optimize it better...

Tool books are difficult to stomach: their contents are so much more ephemeral than other technical books. It's not worth it: in 10 years, will it matter? etc. (This is an incredibly high bar to pose, but that's how high my opinion is of the technical pursuits.) O'Reilly soften this blow, occasionally, by enlisting really brilliant authors who bring in the eternal and the broad while pootering around their narrow furrow. (I am incredibly fond of Alan Gates for this, for instance.) 

Spark is the biggest deal by far in my corner of the world and will probably affect your life in minor ways you will never pin down (see O'Neil below).

<br>
 Software engineering is just a fancy word for design. It consists in getting a long way away from your code – procedural, data, architectural, set-theoretic abstraction – which I resented at first, but which is far more important than it looks. UML is a rigorous, machine-readable graphical logic. Rather than lines of code, design patterns are the real units of serious work. 

This book is painfully exoteric (infected by the ‘stakeholder’ bureaucratese bug), relentless plain, and occasionally the examples are not illustrative, but all right fine. 

(NB 5 years later: The top-down OOP / UML approach has never been useful to me in 5 years of professional coding.)

Alright, so it might be easy to mock (e.g. Connie insists on referring to orgasm as her "crisis"), and it's definitely on the Well of Loneliness / Uncle Tom's Cabin / Yellow Wallpaper side (of books that we can be glad were written and read without wanting to read them ourselves). And sure its idea of class and relative virility is dumb. Also its dichotomising and opposing mind and body, and its revaluation of the body over the mind. And its whole mythology of the phallus. Maybe it reads like a Mills and Boon in places (note that the gruff Northern gamekeeper is really a decorated officer back from the Raj with perfectly fine vowels if he felt like using them)...

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6424171">"Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park, #1)"</a></h3>

Michael Crichton (1991)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2018<br>
<br>
Frankensaurus. Both very clumsy and ahead of its time. Crichton is often described as a one-legged stool: i.e. he has good ideas, but no prose or characters. Ian Malcolm, his sexy radfem primitivist chaos theorist is an exception, and if anything the film's (iconic) depiction of him is less striking and seductive than the sneering pole depicted here.

It's worth picking on Malcolm because he's depicted as prescient, fundamentally correct about the island; he gets the most airtime by far, with the only pushback being Hammond saying "pish posh!" every so often - (Unless you count the raptor attacking him as a discursive act); he is even given the chapter header pages to be oracular on, slowly drawing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve">dragon curve</a> as if it meant anything. And his philosophy, endorsed by Crichton, is tepid and dismaying finger-wagging.



So: He denies that modern life is better than premodern life and endorses Sahlins' lazy-bushman hypothesis:

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘What advances?’ Malcolm said irritably. 'The number of hours women devote to housework has not changed since 1930, despite all the advances. All the vacuum cleaners, washer-dryers, trash compactors, garbage disposals, wash-and-wear fabrics... Why does it still take as long to clean the house as it did in 1930?’
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie said nothing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because there haven’t been any advances,’ Malcolm said. 'Not really. Thirty thousand years ago, when men were doing cave paintings at Lascaux, they worked twenty hours a week to provide themselves with food and shelter and clothing. The rest of the time, they could play, or sleep, or do whatever they wanted. And they lived in a natural world, with clean air, clean water, beautiful trees and sunsets. Think about it. Twenty hours a week. Thirty thousand years ago.’
</blockquote>


The first claim is flatly false: average housework by US women <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w13985.pdf">decreased by about 14 hours(!) a week</a> over this period. (Table 6, last column.) This is despite ballooning house sizes, inventory of objects to maintain, and time actually spent with the children. It also omits our greatly increased levels of hygiene and personal fragrance, though I suppose that could be zero-sum if we habituate to it.

The second is false but not as flatly. I can't find anyone speculating "twenty hours" about the economy of the Upper Paleolithic French. If Crichton is merely mashing up the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_affluent_society">Bushman studies</a> with the punchy image of Lascaux, then despite celebrated dissemination by anthropologists, the claim is untrue: contemporary African hunter-gatherers spend <a href="http://www.rachellaudan.com/2016/01/was-the-agricultural-revolution-a-terrible-mistake.html">more than 50 hours a week on food production</a>. Worse, Malcolm's smug rant puts zero weight on the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/life_history/aging_evolution/hill_2007_hiwi_mortality.html">giant disease burden</a>, the constant warfare, the giant boredom, the crushing conformity and illiberty of nomad life, and the perfect absence of intellectual life among the ancients.

(Judging by the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3654">hostility of Pinker's reviewers</a>, Ian Malcolm is still with us, railing against e.g. consumerism and overpopulation - as if those weren't people just trying to live their lives - and reductionism, denying or minimising the huge material and spiritual gains of science and other blessed modernities.)

More: Malcolm is himself wildly overconfident about modelling, e.g. the fit of basic fractal theory to the park disaster; Crichton is credulous about the almost-completely unfulfilled promises of the wild-eyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute">Santa Fe</a> set.

<blockquote>
They believed that prediction was just a function of keeping track of things. If you knew enough, you could predict anything
</blockquote>

 The latter claim is true for all phenomena except pure random number generators though; the untrue version Crichton means depends on ignorantly thinking that "predict" always (or ever) means "predict with certainty".

Crichton was a programmer, and there's a nice wee code listing in a critical moment, in a made up language resembling <a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/135417/what-can-we-infer-about-the-programming-language-used-in-jurassic-park-the-bo">Perl + Forth + COBOL</a>. Definitely optimised for making the reader feel smart for reading it, or vindicated in skipping it. But points still.

Kate Fox (2005)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Apr 2018<br>
<br>
Pretty funny, maybe the first bit of cultural anthropology I've liked (because it is low-level and in fact exasperatingly empirical). Here is her on her own tribe:

<blockquote>
the... currently fashionable practice  is  to devote at least a chapter of  your book or Ph.D. thesis to a tortured, self-flagellating disquisition on the ethical and methodological difficulties  of   participant  observation.  Although  the  whole  point  of   the  participant  element  is  to  understand  the  culture  from  a  ‘native’ perspective, you must spend a good three pages explaining that your unconscious  ethnocentric  prejudices,  and  various  other  cultural  barriers,  probably  make  this  impossible.  It  is  then  customary  to  question  the  entire  moral  basis  of   the  observation  element,  and,  ideally,  to  express  grave  reservations  about  the  validity  of   modern  Western  ‘science’  as  a  means  of   understanding  anything  at  all. 

At  this  point,  the  uninitiated  reader  might  legitimately  wonder  why  we  continue  to  use  a  research  method  that  is  clearly  either  morally  questionable  or  unreliable  or  both.  I  wondered  this  myself,  until I realised that these doleful recitations of  the dangers and evils of   participant  observation  are  a  form  of   protective  mantra,  a  ritual  chant  similar  to  the  rather  charming  practice  of   some  Native  American tribes who, before setting out on a hunt or chopping down a  tree,  would  sing  apologetic  laments  to  appease  the  spirits  of   the  animals  they  were  about  to  kill  or  the  tree  they  were  about  to  fell.  

A  less  charitable  interpretation  would  see  anthropologists’  ritual  self-abasements  as  a  disingenuous  attempt  to  deflect  criticism  by  pre-emptive confession of  their failings – like the selfish and neglectful lover  who  says,  ‘Oh,  I’m  such  a  bastard,  I  don’t  know  why  you  put  up  with  me,’  relying  on  our  belief   that  such  awareness  and  candid acknowledgement  of   a  fault  is  almost  as  virtuous  as  not  having  it.  

But whatever the motives, conscious or otherwise, the ritual chapter agonising   over   the   role   ofthe   participant   observer   tends   to   be mind-numbingly tedious...
</blockquote>



Even with a style like that, this gets repetitive. But her explicit decoding would be so, so helpful to incomers or neuroatypicals. She is particularly good on the subtle way that class is central in Britain (not "no oiks allowed" but rather "can he choose and pronounce the word 'toilet' ").

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21913812">"This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate"</a></h3>

Naomi Klein (2014)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2016<br>
<br>
Exciting but not persuasive. It's an attempt to borrow the prestige and consensus of the Green movement to push through all the expensive social policies she wanted anyway. 

That sounds cynical, but she says as much right at the start of the book:

<blockquote>I was propelled into a deeper engagement with [environmentalism] partly because I realized it could be a catalyst for forms of social and economic justice in which I already believed... liberals are still averting their eyes, having yet to grasp that climate science has handed them the most powerful argument against unfettered capitalism since William Blake's 'dark Satanic Mills'</blockquote>


Here's what I think the central argument is (she never comes out and says it):

<blockquote>Climate change is an existential risk.
Capitalism exacerbates climate change.
Therefore change capitalism.</blockquote>



But the subtitle's misleading; she constantly blurs the distinction between two theses: 1) 'solving the climate crisis will require regulation of the market', and 2) 'solving the climate crisis will require the abolition of capitalism' In most of this she doesn't endorse (2) at all - "there is plenty of room to make a profit in a zero-carbon economy" - and surprisingly she doesn't deny that <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/armine-sahakyan/the-grim-pollution-pictur_b_9266764.html?guccounter=1">communism</a> <a href="https://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1990/09/ridgeway.html">was worse</a> for the environment than the C20th Western system:

<blockquote>...the truth is that, while contemporary, hyper-globalized capitalism has exacerbated the climate crisis, it did not create it. We started treating the atmosphere as our waste dump when we began using coal on a commercial scale in the late 1700s and engaged in similarly reckless ecological practices well before that. Moreover, humans have behaved in this shortsighted way not only under capitalist systems, but under systems that called themselves socialist as well...</blockquote>


If you read closely enough you see her actual target is not capitalism but 'extractivism', the (ancient!) tendency of people to exploit natural resources relentlessly.

The cause of extractivism is fatuously said to be the philosophical divide between mind and body, whence also science and the industrial revolution. This causation is ascertained in one line, with a vague citation to unnamed feminist scholars having "recognised" (by which she means conclusively demonstrated) this at some point (pp.177).

She's really good at generating urgency and panic: she calls anything that doesn't cut all 10 petagrams of emissions right away a "failure". And since it's a failure, therefore confront and block and yell. (Needless to say, activism can't make all the cuts in time either.)

She has a chapter on each of the non-political solutions: so she is sequentially anti-nuclear, anti-GM, anti-geoengineering, anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading">cap</a>, anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax">tax</a>, anti-<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/13/richard-branson-failed-climate-change-pledge">Branson</a>, anti-'corporate reponsibility'. I suspect she's wrong about most of these. But she is most wrong on the matter of carbon pricing and <a href="www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/09/naomi_klein_is_wrong_corporations_are_doing_more_than_governments_to_halt.html">Big Green</a>. We need to stop <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/oecd-fossil-fuel-subsidies-373-billion-2015">subsidising fossil fuels</a> (you can blame lobbying for those if you like, but this is still a massive government failure). And pricing is the best and least dangerous policy option.

In their stead she promotes "planning and banning" (vast micromanagement of allowed resources and technologies), divestment (which we know has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/17/why-fossil-fuel-divestment-is-a-misguided-tactic">no long-term</a> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-divestment-work">effect</a> on public companies) and blockading machinery (which sorta works but at terrible human cost). She also wants North America to be more northern European, with

<blockquote>
cheap public transit and clean light rail accessible to all: affordable, energy-efficient housing along those transit lines; cities planned for high-density living; bike lanes in which riders aren’t asked to risk their lives to get to work; land management that discourages sprawl and encourages local, low-energy forms of agriculture; urban design that clusters essential services like schools and health care along transit routes and in pedestrian-friendly areas; programs that require manufacturers to be responsible for the electronic waste their produce...</blockquote>


That's most evocative of the Netherlands. But their infrastructure was not born of mass politics, green or otherwise, but rather of high energy costs and low land per capita. <a href="http://induecourse.ca/naomi-klein-this-changes-everything/">Joseph Heath explains</a> that this cost difference

<blockquote>creates the demand for transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly cities, just like the electricity price creates the demand for efficient housing. This is what drives the style of planning that predominates in that country. You can do all the “planning” of urban development you want, but unless people actually want to live in the high-density houses you’re building, they will remain empty. The reason they are attractive to people in the Netherlands is that the alternatives are unattractive, largely because of the cost.

Given the impact that prices have on behaviour throughout the economy, it is clear that the ability to control prices is by far the most powerful policy lever that the state has in its possession. Thus the natural upshot of a wish-list like the one Klein presents is that the state should start to price the carbon externality generated through fossil-fuel consumption, through either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax. And yet this is not what Klein recommends.</blockquote>



Anyway the market is decarbonising. I would say that we have the benefit of the three years of progress since she wrote this, but the (capitalist) trend was clear back then too: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-energy-consumption-by-region">17% renewables</a> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-energy-consumption-by-region">growth per year</a>.


<a href="http://rameznaam.com/2016/04/12/how-cheap-can-electric-vehicles-get/">Electric cars are now cheaper to run than fossil ones</a> and the price curve is tending quickly and strongly down.<a href="http://rameznaam.com/2015/08/10/how-cheap-can-solar-get-very-cheap-indeed/"> New-build solar power is now cheaper per megawatt than oil</a>, and the<a href="http://rameznaam.com/2015/10/14/how-cheap-can-energy-storage-get/"> associated storage cells</a> for night are becoming cheaper even faster. These are both market developments (boosted by subsidies but more and more self-sustaining).

She has a long section on how having a child was the cause of her environmentalism - but she fails to reconcile this with the fact that having a child in the developed world is the <a href="http://blogs.sps.ed.ac.uk/jwi/2017/09/20/if-having-children-is-bad-for-the-environment-what-should-parents-do-about-it/">single most</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378008001003">significant environmental footprint</a> for an individual; it would take an extraordinary amount of work to just zero out this harm.

As economics this is shaky, and as politics unlikely, but she remains a good journalist. Where by journalist I mean 'person who works at the “These terrible unknown things are happening; here is what the people involved say. What might it mean?” level'. She also writes at the "Here is the big picture and what to do about it" level though, and honestly I recommend just walking right by those bits (pages 1 through 300).

Minus a point because it falsely maligns effective and politically available environment policies, and so has done expected harm.

Ooft. Uncomfortable navel-gazing about navel-gazing. Autobiographical metafictional first-world problems: unrequited narcissism and joint solipsism. Also writer’s block. 

It’s hard to talk about pretentious things that know they are and discuss it well: this is masterful about sophomorism and novel about the navel. It directs interpretation – ‘I can’t call it wanky, it just called itself wanky!’. 

Heti’s deadly serious about frivolous things, but also important ones (e.g. the passage detailing her sexual masochism, or ‘The White Men Go to Africa’, mocking poverty tourists.) The artistic equivalent of a hundred selfies.

Databasing is all of the following: a hard precondition of almost all modern social activities; the high-stakes application of some very deep intellectual tortures; unutterably boring. This book's a nice intro to higher-level considerations: Query tuning (i.e. ask the question better), indexing (i.e. ask if it's been asked before), server tuning (ask a better person), replication (ask several people), benchmarking (ask trick questions). Not exactly chatty, but as engaging as you could expect:

<blockquote>The chapter concludes with recommendations for the long term care and feeding of your column indexes.</blockquote>



And it's not as gruesomely platform-specific as the title implies.

<blockquote>changing hardware might, in the best case, give you a 10-fold increase in speed. But tuning queries can often give you 1000-fold performance increase. Seriously.</blockquote>



Not deep, though: they namedrop B-trees and the query optimiser, but do not explain them beyond noting that they are very good and you should trust them. I haven't yet seen a bad O'Reilly book.

Very clear, very humane. Underneath his smiley-grumpy homilies is an intuitive brand of cognitive science. (He gives a couple of scientific citations, but the model has much more to do with simple sympathetic cynicism than evidence.) 

That is: Minimise text; have a strong visual hierarchy of size, prominence, clickability; have clear spaced sections of content on each page; keep page names literal; keep the background quiet; never write instructions - make it wordlessly, mindlessly obvious; use conventions unless you have a good reason not to.

Deeply unsubtle bio-libertarian thriller. Tom Clancy plus software plus anti-statism plus globalisation. Lots of ideas; Naam knows enough about code and brain-machine interfaces to make gestures towards the big info-nano-tech turning point in our near-to-mid-future, and acknowledges the horrors it is likely to enable. ("The Chandler Act (aka the Emerging Technological Threats Act of 2032) is the opening salvo in a new War on Science. To understand the future course of this war, one need only look at the history of the War on Drugs and the War on Terror. Like those two manufactured "wars", this one will be never-ending, freedom-destroying, counterproductive, and ultimately understood to have caused far more damage than the supposed threat it was aimed at ever could have.") He has a nice message:

<blockquote>	Broad dissemination and individual choice turn most technologies into a plus.  If only the elites have access, it&#8217;s a dystopia..

But the cheap prose and action (and the abuse of Nietzsche) are too wearing, particularly coming right after Stross, a master thereof.

<br>
Two globish co-dependents of unequal intelligence but equal mawkishness take turns at monologue, for ages and ages. One’s oracular, the other Boswellian, which means that both talk about the nasty past of the oracular one, Zafar. Everyone’s always trying to educate everyone else, without invitation. 

Tragic, panoptic, and treats big C21st problems – neocolonialism, quant finance, the ineffectiveness of NGOs, the nature of the transnational élite that administers all these things. But also dull, overwritten and clumsily polymathic (characters can be found over-reading, variously, Gödel, Middlemarch, the birth of Bangladesh, the Brit-pop band James). The book is aware of its own pomp – there’s a long discussion of sincerity as virtue and vice, a raging attack on Anglophone Indian literature, and Zafar quotes more and more as he disintegrates, suggesting that the book’s larding of quotations is a knowing prop. But while I don’t know whether it’s Zafar or Rahman that the book’s clumsiness is rooted in, I don’t have to, to know that his conceit of desperate knowledge didn’t take root in me. 

I shouldn’t say panoptic: there’s only one woman in this, really, and we don’t see much even of her except as deceiver and appalling vehicle for privilege. Chapter 14’s good – a big bickering, drunken dinner with Pakistani elites, and there are details to admire throughout (Zafar broods over microaggressions, and some of his apercus are sparkling – like his characterisation of maths as “thinking without the encumbrance of knowledge”, or his likening of a good essay to “a good dress – long enough to cover the important bits, short enough to be interesting”). 

Last, very superficially: there are no speech marks, and this deadens the dialogue for me; it makes everything look past-tense and snarky. (Ok sure this works incredibly well in Blood Meridian, but only because all the men in that are wholly dead inside).

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/196487">"Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution"</a></h3>

Francis Fukuyama (2003)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2014<br>
<br>
Attack on transhumanism brought to you by a man most famous for being <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/12/27/the_bend_of_history">wrong</a>. Now he worries that science is going to make life too easy – that overcoming human evolution’s horrible legacy issues (e.g. ubiquitous mental illness, moral myopia, unspeakable death) with biotechnology will amount to the death of the soul. (Where the soul is that which thrives on adversity, is real / spiritual / creative, and Takes Responsibility.) 

I shouldn’t mock; Fukuyama at least handles this fear secularly and rationally, and his existential claim is not wrong by definition; also, it is interesting to him endorse regulation for once. This is a clear statement of a common (the default?) position on a matter of huge importance.

However, his arguments are piss-poor: he argues via 1) using fictional evidence – Brave New World and the Bible; by 2) suggesting, without real evidence, that there are insurmountable trade-offs between longevity and cognition, happiness and creativity, and personality and freedom; and by 3) a truly massive suppressed premise: that things are ok as they are (or, at least, as good as they get). 

The first section, laying out 2002’s cutting edge in life extension, neuropharmacology, and genetic engineering, is fair and good. He accuses bioethicists of being gung-ho shills for Industry, which is interesting, but completely opposed to my experience of them as timid precautionists.

Normally I wouldn't take health advice from a bodybuilding rando. But I'm already persuaded by normal channels about the benefits of fasting, so this is for the art of it.

Much better than it looks. He is probably too enthusiastic about fasting and keto (though his definition is broad: he skips breakfast every day to get a 16 hour mini-fast). But the evidence is solid for occasional fasts (for weight maintenance in a superstimulating environment, anti-inflammation, immune health, "autophagy" cleanup time).

Very practical. Most important:

<blockquote>Not getting enough electrolytes is the most common reason why people fail fasting 
for longer periods of time. if you only consume pure water, then you’re practically just flushing out all of the essential minerals from your body, which can cause serious dehydration and 
problems with nerves.

The most important electrolytes you need are sodium, magnesium, and potassium. But you also have to pay attention to the quantities [given]...

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1381">"The Odyssey"</a></h3>

Homer (2006)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2019<br>
<br>
I don't want to hector Homer. But somehow this was both boring and evil, both childish and didactic. I won't belabour the book's immorality, since it is so obvious; it's the near-total absence of artistic merit that is apparently not obvious. I found nothing in it worth reading or quoting until Book 9, nearly half way through. Songs of praise of warmongering pirates. (People love pirates, and I say let em. Just don't call them paragons.) 

The ideology is dad porn, a set of thin, obvious, animal values. "Kings do whatever they want - death for messing with a noble; don't cross the priests; offer huge sacrifices; always do what your husband and dad say; the unlucky and the disabled are cursed and to be shunned; blood is blood is blood."

<blockquote>The ghost
of Agamemnon answered, “Lucky you,
cunning Odysseus: you got yourself
a wife of virtue—great Penelope.
How principled she was, that she remembered
her husband all those years! Her fame will live
forever, and the deathless gods will make
a poem to delight all those on earth
about intelligent Penelope.
</blockquote>

(Odysseus sleeps with half a dozen other women and demigods, most of them begging him to, and needless to say suffers nothing of it.)

There's no mention of the suffering of the several cities he sacks, or the many tacitly raped women. Dozens of people are murdered for being rude, though. For a quasi-sacred text there's a surprising amount of unpunished priest killing (e.g. Leodes).

The structure is awful: we see almost nothing of Odysseus for the first quarter of the poem, instead following his son around as he listens to a series of boring old men. Most of Odysseus' feats are not shown, are instead related by him as unaffecting stories. (I suppose we could amuse ourselves by treating this as unreliable narration, but they certainly didn't.) And the poem doesn't end at its climax, instead meandering on through another few books of pointless back-patting.

(Should I go easy? After all, this is groundbreaking work, the prototype of art. Sure; I'll go easy if you stop hyping it and making everyone read it as an exemplar.)
(It's not that they could easily have been otherwise. Too poor, too lawless, too near to nature.)

It must be a cliche among classicists that the 'Classical' civilisations were not <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/classical">classical</a> in the sense of being austere, logical, tasteful, or contemplative. That they were not Apollonian, that only a handful of people in them were. I hope my rant here is not just me being misled by the modern sense of "hero" - but the fact is that Odysseus wins, is praised endlessly, and his rights trump all else.

This isn't just me being clueless, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orality">post-oral</a>, and close-minded: The ancients were well aware that the ending is unsatisfying crap. One popular headcanon was that, after Odysseus slays the suitors, he is immediately exiled from Ithaca, set adrift again. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPrd8FoClAA">Cue the music!</a>

---

One reading of Odysseus' name is as variant of the verb '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus#Name,_etymology,_and_epithets">to be hated</a>'. So a calque might be "King Punchable of Ithaca". ("the most unhappy man alive")

Odysseus is treated incredibly well by almost everyone, despite his crimes. Complete strangers oil him up and dress him in fine "woolen cloak and tunic" eleven times, and he is given precious weaponry and potions for nothing several times. This is supposed to reflect on him, but instead it shows the Greek ideal of hospitality, one of the few nice things in that culture.

He appears to sincerely miss Ithaca (his status more than his wife), weeping frequently. But he also fucks about all the time, for instance staying an entire year voluntarily enjoying Circe.

It is completely unclear what O does to deserve his fortune. (Whereas his misfortune is always directly linked to his own machismo or idiocy.) The only virtues we see him exercise directly (not counting brute aggression and discus throwing) are courage and cunning (specifically lying). Ok, he also makes one good speech:

<blockquote>'Listen to me, my friends, despite your grief.
We do not know where darkness lives, nor dawn,
nor where the sun that shines upon the world
goes underneath the earth, nor where it rises.
We need a way to fix our current plight,
but I do not know how...</blockquote>


I suppose we can put the rest down to charisma, the oddest and least rational of human powers.

<blockquote>'It seems that everybody loves this man,
and honors him, in every place we sail to.'</blockquote>


Everyone extols him without him ever demonstrating the virtues they extol. (Politeness, propriety, wisdom, strategy...) Every other idiot is "godlike" at something or other, and seeing the state of their gods you see how this could be true. At least it's funny:

<blockquote>He went out of his bedroom like a god</blockquote>

<blockquote>King Menelaus, you are right... Your voice is like a god's to us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Majestic, holy King Alcinous
leapt out of bed, as did Odysseus
the city-sacker. Then the blessed king,
mighty Alcinous, led out his guest...</blockquote>


(The gods are stupid mirrors of Greek nobility; for instance they have supernatural slaves, the nymphs.) This at least is a philosophical difference between them and I: in their superstitious idealist mode, properties aren't for describing the present, but instead the timeless essence of a thing:

<blockquote>Ships are "black", "hollow", "swift" or "curved", never "brown", "slow" or "wobbly"... Penelope is "prudent Penelope", never "swift-footed Penelope", even if she is moving quickly. Telemachus is thoughtful, even when he seems particularly immature.
</blockquote>



All the feats of the heroes are totally dependent on the power of gods. If they say you can't sail, you can't.

<blockquote>His skin 
would have been ripped away, and his bones smashed
had not Athena given him a thought.</blockquote>



<blockquote>Athena poured unearthly charm
upon his head and shoulders, and she made him
taller and sturdier, so these Phaecians
would welcome and respect him.</blockquote>


Without Hermes or Athena constantly intervening, O would be nowhere, achieve nothing. One nice tension here though:

<blockquote>But death is universal. Even gods
cannot protect the people that they love,
when fate and cruel death catch up with them.</blockquote>



One of the few times I felt sympathy for Odysseus was when he was trying to lead his men, who are mainly large-adult-sons. (Same with the suitors.) One breaks his neck falling down a ladder. They undo a month of work by playing with the bag of winds. Several times they are totally paralysed by their wailing and tantrums.

<blockquote>As when 
a herd of cows is coming back from pasture
into the yard; and all the little heifers
jump from their pens to skip and run towards
their mothers, and they cluster round them, mooing;
just so my men, as soon they saw me, 
began to weep...</blockquote>



<blockquote>The other men... 
wept for those that died. I ordered them
to stop their crying, scowling hard at each.
</blockquote>


Odysseus occasionally draws his sword on them for backtalking him, or running around like Muppets. Their deaths are roughly equally due to Odysseus' aggression and avarice, and their own foolishness.

I cheered the uprising against him, who are completely in the right. But of course they lose, because of mere divine intervention.

---

OK I lied: I will talk about evil. Though by the end of this I was jaded and dismissive, the aftermath of Odysseus slaughtering the suitors still struck me as an atrocity unusual for the genre:

<blockquote>"When the whole house is set in proper order,
restore my halls to health: take out the [slave] girls
between the courtyard wall and the rotunda.
Hack at them with long swords, eradicate
all life from them. They will forget the things
<b>the suitors made them do</b> with them in secret,
through Aphrodite..."

"I refuse to grant these girls
a clean death, since they poured down shame on me
and Mother, when they lay beside the suitors."

At that, he would a piece of sailor's rope
round the rotunda...
just so the girls, their heads all in a row,
were strung up with the noose around their necks
to make their death an agony. They gasped,
feet twitching for a while, but not for long.</blockquote>



I've read de Sade, Kaczynski, Himmler, Houellebecq, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Virologist">Egan</a> and <a href="https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm">Watts</a> at their most dyspeptic; it's not that I'm squeamish about real or fictional evil, or that my sulking sense of justice blinds me to aesthetics. This sort of thing happened; nothing cannot be said; maybe even nothing cannot be said beautifully. It's just that, again, there is nearly no nobility and no classicism in this. I am so glad this culture is gone.

---

Did its audience know the story was bullshit? Or was it scripture to them? (Like most scripture, it is pathetically ignoble, violent, and self-serving.) Well, <a href="https://www.franksmitha.com/history/homer.htm">they don't seem</a> to have had scripture, not even Hesiod. So Homer is more like Dante or Milton for them: not sacred, but pious and moralising.

How big was mighty Troy? How noble was godlike Odysseus? How petty their pantheon? How long this epic?

---

* Even thought-provoking bits like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus-eaters">lotus eaters</a> or Cyclopean anarchism are over in less than half a page.

* Surprised when Zeus was described as "husband of Hera". 

* The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outis#Origin_of_the_name">no man</a>" pun thing was so stupid I had to put the book down for a couple of days.

---

Normally I would stop reading a book this bad, but I read it to prepare for Ulysses, so I dragged myself through.

Wilson's introduction takes up a quarter of the entire book. It's good and sane but repetitive, taking pains to spell out all the ignoble and questionable, all the ugly and clumsy parts. I don't know how she keeps up her enthusiasm for the book, in the face of them, but more power to her.

Plus two points for Wilson's intro and demystified translation.

Robert M. Sapolsky (2017)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2017<br>
<br>
Has an ingenious structure: starting with a piece of behaviour, work backwards through the many scales that caused it: from the nerve bundles that enable the muscle motion, through the brain processing that ordered those, through that morning's hormonal predisposing, foetal genetic construction, all the way to the ancestral environment.

Sapolsky is engagingly cranky about various things: traditional misogynies, war. He uses the neologism "pseudospeciation" (i.e. the dehumanising kind of racism) about 50 times.

He is often thrillingly unimpressed:

<blockquote> Jane Goodall blew everyone's socks off by reporting the now-iconic fact that chimps make tools... Most cultural anthropologists weren't thrilled by Goodall's revolution, and now emphasise definitions that cut chimps and other hoi polloi out of the party. There's a fondness for the thinking of Alfred Kroeber, Clyde Kluckhohn, and Clifford Geertz, three heavyweights who focused on how culture is about ideas and symbols, rather than the mere behaviours in which they instantiate, or material products like flint blades or iPhones... 

Basically, I don't want to go anywhere near these debates. For our purposes we'll rely on an intuitive definition of culture emphasised by Frans de Waal: culture is how we do and think about things.
</blockquote>


But he's way too credulous about social science. For instance, I recommend skipping the last half of chapter 3, on social psychology, entirely. In the space of two pages (p90-1) he cites <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797616658563?journalCode=pssa">power</a> <a href="http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/dana_carney/pdf_my%20position%20on%20power%20poses.pdf">pose</a>, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691616674458">facial feedback</a>, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691616652873">ego </a><a href="http://www.psy.miami.edu/ehblab/PubBiasSelfControlEgo.pdf">depletion</a>, and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094715300517">himmicanes</a>; all as exciting, uncontroversial fact. This is a clean sweep of recent studies well-known to be p-hacked, low-power and spurious. 

He also endorses the results of <a href="https://qz.com/1144504/the-world-is-relying-on-a-flawed-psychological-test-to-fight-racism/">Implicit Association</a> and stereotype threat tests far too strongly. I don't know enough about neuroscience or endocrinology or ethology to make a similar recommendation for the other chapters. But the "<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2011/08/the-murray-gell-mann-amnesia-effect/">Gell-Mann amnesia</a>" effect sadly suggests that we should (partially) discount everything else in here, primates aside; evidence of credulity in one domain is evidence for others.

(Best case, he just didn't keep up with the latest research dramas. Though some results, like the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/322/5908/1681">litter -> theft link</a> or <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973533.2013.856792">the Macbeth effect</a>, have been <a href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/38329/">comprehensively</a> <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1368430213502557">criticised</a> for 8+ years now, so.)

He also takes anthropologists at their qualitative, cherry-picking word when they try to maintain their academic boundary against Pinker's work on violence.

Still worth it for his first-hand stories - him watching Somali oil workers conduct ritual argument, him watching a troop of baboons spread a culture - a pocket of pacifism and gender sanity in the psychotic roundabout of nature.

Minus 1 point because his empirical judgments are unreliable. : (

<br>
Deeply conventional mind candy - it may be the skewed mores of the Cthulhu Mythos post-Whedon, but those are pretty conformist these days. Though the right reference class for this series is Robert Rankin, not Lovecraft. Lots of clumsy geek references (re: trains, smartphone fetishes, programming concepts), and lots of clumsy US-centric edits ("taking the DLR to Canary Wharf in the east of London" said no Londoner ever). I wonder if this is just because he writes so fast these days (~2 books a year).
 
His great strength remains the tawdriness of office life (which he manages to accurately display despite also displaying ancient tentacular spectacles). e.g. a nice touch here: the office audit of paperclip usage - previously a joke about pedantry and bureaucracy gone wild - is revealed to have a deadly serious rationale.

One surprising grey area in the plot: <spoiler>the Laundry produces some fake research to draw out the cultists. It says that the apocalypse will spread exponentially fast, and is inevitable. But the cult leader is relatively rational, trying to make humanity survive, and so this false catastrophe actually pushes them over the edge. Epistemic poisoning.</spoiler>

I continue to have mixed feelings about Stross, but hey I continue to read him. (Book #1, Atrocity Archives works best because it subverts James Bond more, and the Nazi villains are fun, and the gag hasn't worn thin.)

Incomprehensible - and it's difficult to believe that's due to honest ambition, or honest confusion.

Taking him on face value (pardon the pun) though, his ethics makes infinities out of molehills and so has no help to offer us.

Peter H. Cannon (1994)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2019<br>
<br>
Clever enough mashup, and obviously loving, but the prose misses the mark on every page, jolting us out of Plum's dreamworld without even sending into Howard's nightmarish one. (It might seem shallow to judge something on the prose alone, but you can't have Jeeves without perfect pitch, it consists in comic timing and music; if you come at the master you best not miss.)

Critical essay linking Wodehouse, Lovecraft and Doyle is also clever. W and L we're both fantasy authors you see.

I realise there's a lot of Jeeves homage going around, published and Authorised, and so not looking like the fanfiction it is.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872">"The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past, #1)"</a></h3>

Liu Cixin (2014)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2016<br>
<br>
Dense, clever, and it conveys a pleasant worldview; but also rushed and clumsy. In fact the prose is awful - full of flat descriptions of people's reactions, people's full names inserted into the dialogue - and the characters are completely interchangeable ciphers (apart from the one who is a stock renegade cop, and the one who is the Ultimate Eco-Terrorist).

<blockquote>Can the fundamental nature of matter really be lawlessness? Can the stability and order of the world be but a temporary dynamic equilibrium achieved in a corner of the universe, a short-lived eddy in a chaotic current?</blockquote>



There's almost no '<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">showing</a>' in the entire book.

<blockquote>For most people, perhaps time would have gradually healed these wounds. After all, during the Cultural Revolution, many people suffered fates similar to hers, and compared to many of them, Ye was relatively fortunate. But Ye had the mental habits of a scientist, and she refused to forget. Rather, she looked with a rational gaze on the madness and hatred that had harmed her. Ye’s rational consideration of humanity’s evil side began the day she read Silent Spring.

Have you heard of the Monte Carlo method? Ah, it’s a computer algorithm often used for calculating the area of irregular shapes. Specifically, the software puts the figure of interest in a figure of known area, such as a circle, and randomly strikes it with many tiny balls, never targeting the same spot twice. After a large number of balls, the proportion of balls that fall within the irregular shape compared to the total number of balls used to hit the circle will yield the area of the shape.
</blockquote>


This is no impediment to good hard scifi, it just means that the reference author is Asimov, not Banks or LeGuin. Liu's ideas are well worth the trip - firing at a nuke as a last-resort for disarming it (since the small ones rely on a sealed pressurised container) is about the least ambitious thought in it:

<blockquote>Twenty minutes later, Three Body’s Von Neumann architecture human-formation computer had begun full operations under the Qin 1.0 operating system. “Run solar orbit computation software ‘Three Body 1.0’!” Newton screamed at the top of his lungs. “Start the master computing module! Load the differential calculus module! Load the finite element analysis module! Load the spectral method module! Enter initial condition parameters … and begin calculation!” The motherboard sparkled as the display formation flashed with indicators in every color. The human computer began the long computation.

In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos.

Comrades! Revolutionary youths! Revolutionary faculty and staff! We must clearly understand the reactionary nature of Einstein’s theory of relativity. This is most apparent in general relativity: Its static model of the universe negates the dynamic nature of matter. It is anti-dialectical! It treats the universe as limited, which is absolutely a form of reactionary idealism…

I don't understand why this won the Hugo - except, that, being foreign, it didn't trigger canned political backlash on either side of the sad affair we have made the Hugos. Tom Clancy for real nerds.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037">"Debt: The First 5,000 Years"</a></h3>

David Graeber (2011)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2013<br>
<br>
Exciting and well-written but unreliable and unfocussed. The main thesis is that debt isn't straightforward accounting: all systems of debt require a hidden moral assumption, which is that it's bad to be indebted, that debt overrules other moral claims like equity or even survival:

<blockquote>paying one’s debts is not the essence of morality, that all these things are human arrangements and that if democracy is to mean anything, it is the ability to all agree to arrange things in a different way.</blockquote>


To establish this he goes into an array of human economies: slaving, gift economies, Kula rings... but the brute fact of diverse institutions doesn't really connect with his moral thesis. Then this all goes towards his grand equating of the market and the state (so that people will resist both of them). 

He argues that formal debt (of accountants and lawyers) causes poverty and violence relative to traditional informal debt (of cousins, dowries, and sheep). But this is wildly inconsistent with the last two hundred years of social development; poverty is a fraction of what it was, and violence (including state violence, including incarceration as violence) is also down.

He gets worked up about "the myth of barter", the largely silly idea that there was generally a transition from pure barter economies to money economies at some point in cultural history. Even if we grant this, his estimation of the significance of barter being rare is excessive. It doesn't have any clear moral bearing.

His debt Jubilee idea, coming as it did post-Recession, is superficially good, especially since giant financiers had just received trillions in bailouts. But if we made debt forgiveness a common concern, we'd just be redistributing money to those best at obtaining credit via excessive self-esteem, credentials or scamming. And post-Jubilee credit system would immediately dry up, or sting us with vast interest rates. They couldn't exist otherwise, and then homeowning and car purchase would again be only within reach for the rich.

There are dozens or more or less serious errors in it. (Still less unreliable than most anarchism and most cultural anthropology.) If you still want to read it, you really should take note of the huge errata others have helpfully contributed to Graeber, not that he'd thank them:

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6710154">"We in Scotland: Thatcherism in a Cold Climate"</a></h3>

David Torrance (2009)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2019<br>
<br>
I was amazed that this is the only book about her reception in Scotland. Growing up during Blair, Thatcher was still by far the most famous politician in Scotland; small children knew to hate her, to sing rhymes about <a href="
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/uk_confidential/1095121.stm  ">one of her policies</a>.

But actually our booklessness fits - we don't really analyse why she was a demon. Adults might mutter something about the poll tax or <a href="https://youtu.be/QOZzFXolGJc">the shipyards</a> or the Belgrano, but in general people don't think about what she actually did, they just follow the received wisdom that she was a bloodthirsty high-heid ogre who killed jobs for fun. 

(If Malcolm Rifkind is willing to write the foreword for your book, you'd be forgiven for inferring something about its slant - and indeed MR characterises the opposition as merely disliking a bossy English woman speaking down to them in RP. This is risible, and predictably risible.)

Torrance reports the month-by-month history. He's impatient with kneejerk anti-Thatcherism, the kind which forgets her relative electoral gains in '79 and '83, which ignores the global forces of deindustrialisation which Thatcher had relatively little power over (only unused power to slow and soften the effects). There's no Tories shyer than Scottish Tories, but they're there - <a href="
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Kingdom_general_election_in_Scotland">29%</a> in the last election, back up to early Thatcher levels.

She repeatedly used Scotland as a policy testing ground, in what it's fair to call naked opportunism. (Little to lose by 1989, electorally.) She galvanised opposition and gave the country an Other to unite against. We threw eggs, rioted against regressive taxation, and drew funny satire - but bought our council houses off her, hoovered up our shares in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Group#Privatisation">BT</a> and Steel, and mostly accepted her careerist world, disorganised labour. The poll tax finished her - but she still won, and all it cost her was a century of hatred.

After reading this I still don't know what the bottom line is.

<br>
Overview of both the literary and scifi books, one-by-one. Thus skimmable by anyone who would want to read it in the first place (...)

Worth it, for fans, for the absolutely amazing interview with a PhD student, in which he refuses all invitations to pompous theory:

<blockquote>
JR: You've used the word "play" to describe your use of form and narrative structure. As I'm sure you know, in recent years the term play has been used to describe a certain kind of postmodern engagement with the world. To what extent do you consider your work to be postmodern?

IB: I confess I don't think about it at all. I've never been good on literary or societal theory. I've long since decided people like me just write what we do and let other people worry about the analytical side.

JR: Have you read any work by Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, or Emanuel Levinas (or any other continental philosophers)? If you have, what did you think?

IB: The little I've read I mostly didn't understand, and the little I understood of the little I've read seemed to consist either of rather banal points made difficult to understand by deliberately opaque and obstructive language (this might have been the translation, though I doubt it), or just plain nonsense. Or it could be I'm just not up to the mark intellectually, of course.

JR: You have written quite a few novels that use Freudian imagery and tropes—The Wasp Factory, Use of Weapons, The Bridge, Walking on Glass—What do you think of Freudian psychoanalysis?

IB: Never been entirely sold on it. I suspect Freud's theories tell you a great deal about Freud, quite a lot about the monied middle-class in Vienna a hundred-plus years ago, and only a little about people in general. Like Marx, he was too keen to insist that his area of study was genuinely a science. Also like Marx, though, he provides a genuinely useful and insightful (if, especially in Freud's case, limited) way of looking at people and their hidden lives (well, more implied lives with Marx, relating to their economic function within a society). Anyway, I can honestly say that I've never deliberately included any Freudian imagery in my stories, so what's there must be the result of my subconscious. . . . Uh-oh. . .

Craig Loehle (2010)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2019<br>
<br>
Pretty sensible but very long-winded and staid. I suppose it is actually quite vigorous and irreverent, coming from an organisation man:

<blockquote>study can be a substitute for productive work</blockquote>



<blockquote>   Darwin considered himself to be a geologist, but the world remembers largely his biology. Should Goethe be in the literature, biology, physics, or philosophy department? He actually was most proud of his work on optics, though that work was largely flawed. Would Newton or Fisher find comfortable academic niches today?</blockquote>



<blockquote>All graduate students are taught that it is essential to become an expert. As a short-term goal this is, of course, valid. Academic search committees are also looking for experts. As a lifestyle, however, becoming an expert can inhibit creativity... As one becomes more of an expert, a larger and more complex network of facts and explanations accumulates and solidifies, making it difficult to entertain radical alternative ideas or to recognize new problems... An Aristotle or Freud may create a set of bars within which most people pace rigidly, never noticing clues from outside the cage</blockquote>



<blockquote>it is much more likely that one can work at 100% mental clarity for about four hours. If one keeps this in mind, then a distinction can be made between critical issues that need full clarity and intense effort, which become part of the four hours of work per day, and those parts of a project that are routine and become part of the rest of the day... returning calls, coding a clearly designed subroutine, ordering equipment, attending seminars, editing reports, etc</blockquote>



But these are the only interesting bits in 300 pages. This is true but the book doesn't help much:

<blockquote> scientists are largely uncoached and are rarely introspective. They spend a lot of
time studying their disciplinary subject matter, but almost no time learning strategies of problem solving</blockquote>

* He gives examples from many different domains (ecology, epidemiology, physics, hardware), but so I spotted some errors.
* A new record! Loehle cites a crashing falsehood on p.2, and several times elsewhere: Gardner's DOA <a href="https://researched.org.uk/myth-busting-gardners-multiple-intelligences/">theory of multiple intelligences</a>. And he naively teases out the strategic implications. He harps on this theme repeatedly - e.g. this is also flatly false: above a certain minimal level, IQ and college grades are not predictive of <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c6ef/f99ef5b7423b882b2e34034f910508fc50c6.pdf">productivity</a>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2007-strenze.pdf">success</a>, or <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-IQ-of-Nobel-Laureates">innovation</a>.
* He tries to talk about software but is stuck in the 90s. He has no sense of open-sourcing software as the most successful strategy (witness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost#Awards">XGB</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras#Traction">Chollet</a>).
* It tries to also appeal to business people, for some reason. Half the examples and advice are about corporate decisionmaking (The proper focus or perspective is essential when looking at business performance.) This is distracting and makes it feel generic, belies the title.
* His "new model of the scientific method" is vague and doesn't deserve the word.
* The chapter on social distortions (credit stealing, cherry-picking, trends and irrational effects of publication timing) is ok, just ahead of the Replication crisis curve.

---

Anyway: as a scientist you want problems. But not just any problem - something that both doesn't fit, & has important implications. Advice I read in this, or read into it:  

* A theory can be inconsistent or incomplete: one generate contradiction, the other keeps explanations weak.
* Paradoxes are shortcuts to the frontier. Look for heated debates and find a synthesis / circumvention. When you have one: Find tacit assumptions; Make new distinctions; Operationalise!

Very formulaic, two or three formulae. 1) the tragic child; 2) bullied outcast responding with excess force; 3) Gaiman-Whedon fairytales winking too hard. Portentous in all but five cases, mostly clumsily so. Glorifying bad decisions just because they are autonomous. Sprinkling of non-English languages, otherwise less knowledge than I look for. Good amount of very bad poetry too.

I'd have stopped reading this about a quarter through, but I was looking for new writers. I figured that if Tor snagged Egan, Abercrombie, Miéville, Reynolds, Stross, surely some of the other 22 authors, chosen from presumed thousands, would be good. 3 are (Larson, Tidbeck and Kemper), but this knowledge cost me more than I thought.

Painless by Rich Larson. Really nice. Dozens of original details. I liked the recycling replicator, feeding a stray your fingers, the Arabic-Hausa neologisms, procedural cartoons, dying face unlock. I flinched for the CIPA characters even though it means nothing to them.

The Song, Erinn Kemper. Plenty of tension and ambiguity, unlike the other stories. Say you work on a machine that kills the creatures you love, because that's how you get to study them alive. Characters with more than one value, making terrible decisions, not solving problems, not quipping, not punching up. The setup relies on you thinking there's a difference in kind between killing a whale and killing a cow, which I don't. There's even a dig at monomaniacal Greens: "the carbon footprint resulting from eating whale meat is substantially lower than that of beef(...)" Works.

“Blue Morphos in the Garden” by Lis Mitchell. Playful sort of death, natural afterlife. I am glad the protagonist pushes back against the ancestor-worship and collective subsumption.

<blockquote>"Don't you think it’s selfish not to leave something that Lily can see, that she can tell her children about?”
“Don’t you think it’s a bit much to expect me to define my entire life by my motherhood and the expectation that my daughter will want me around forever?"
</blockquote>




“Water: A History” by KJ Kabza. romance vs economics. Still touched by the blind contrarian spirit of this volume, but at least it's well done.

“Skinner Box” by Carole Johnstone. Trapped in a tiny spaceship with your lover and your rapist. Angsty astronauts, too horny and sadistic to live. You can't send people this fucked up into space. But we will. Narrator is called a genius but shows no signs of it. Johnstone manages to make deep learning nasty, just by associating it with these mean narrow bastards. Nice mention of Graphcore, my local overweening tech giant.

<blockquote>"I don’t like the unpredictability of people. Of neocortexes. But I hate the predictability of nanites. The incorruptibility."<br>
"Bots are just automated programs. They mostly replicate what we can already do, so we don’t have to do it. Conventional bots are ones and zeros. Nanites are built from DNA.” - but substrate is irrelevant to program.</blockquote>


Cruel, vague, but has a few ideas at least.


"One/Zero". Warzone children scene manipulative, saccharine. At least she's thinking big, Santa Superintelligence / Surveill. Boy and god. AI unbixes itself and everything goes swell. Attempt at lyrical Uplift mandala but ends up clumsy and soppy-stern.
could their imagined trajectories be any worse than our increasing totalitarianism? Or any worse than one of the main hallmarks of what it means to be human, which is to kill our fellows, or even send our own kin to torture or death if a certain “belief”—whatever a belief might be, neurochemically speaking—has taken up residence in our unfathomable brains?
Bring it on, I say. The change might be for the better.

“Seonag and the Seawolves” by M. Evan MacGriogair. Nice Celtic colour and rhythm, though actually it gets in the way of the images. The Gaelic is mostly not translated, and I didn't bother to google it. Portentous as usual, far too many one-sentence paragraphs, but it does islander prejudice and peaty magic well.

"Old Media" by Annalee Newitz. Central conceit - that we would have economically-profitable human slavery at the same time as human-level AI - is full-on nonsense, but I actually didn't mind much. Goofy picture of a future humanities degree, studying harem anime and anti-robotism with your ace robot gf.

<blockquote>She [robot gf] looked so beautiful that John thought his heart would crack open like the space eggs in a kaiju movie, full of lava and lightning and life forms that had never walked the Earth. </blockquote>



“More Real Than Him” by Silvia Park. Protagonist is a basic K-pop stan and a sexist haxxor snob. (Hard to imagine such being technically talented, but some surely are.) Fun.


“The Hundredth House Had No Walls” by Laurie Penny. Extremely conventional subversion of fairy tales, the princess saves herself in this one eh. Flat and clear and fine.

"Beyond the El" by John Chu. Maudlin food magic. Few outright errors, as well as an apparently intentional hypernegation tic ("aren't not exactly rich", "the wind was not freezing"). Sister character is a boring 2D sociopath.

“As the Last I May Know” by S. L. Huang. Nuclear Omelas. Contains a dreadful slander on Otto Hahn, naming the warmonger nuke-happy president after him. Dreadful haiku. I'd have liked some details on how exactly they kept their nuclear secrets for 200 years; we didn't manage two. The story hinges on a false dichotomy, that the superweapon will necessarily kill children. Unless it's a very dense population, or the enemy are using hostages, then she doesn't explain why there's no tactical use.

“Deriving Life” by Elizabeth Bear. Incredibly glib, replacing the rightful defamiliarisation and mirror-darkly of SF with applause lights ("Can you imagine a planet full of assholes who used to just . . . cut down trees?") Premise is bizarre and cool and she doesn't pull it off.

“Articulated Restraint” by Mary Robinette Kowal. Really irritating. Why do people glorify going to space when you're physically messed up? I guess this would be less pointless if you liked the character from elsewhere. I guess the actual Apollo equipment protocol details are nice.


Would be one star without the Egan, Larson, Tidbeck, Kemper 3-stars.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10379376">"The House of Wisdom: How Arabic Science Saved Ancient Knowledge and Gave Us the Renaissance"</a></h3>

Jim Al-Khalili (2011)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Feb 2019<br>
<br>
Surprisingly dull and unanalytical. al-Khalili is good-natured and knowledgeable, but he puts in too many people, too many dates, and too little science. He tries to cover seven hundred years and multiple kingdoms, and the theological and military context, and ends up shallowly mentioning these things and little more. It would have been better to focus on the greats - Khwarizmi, Kindi, Haytham, Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd - and explain their actual achievements, then note that work of this calibre was done by others over centuries too.

Cool questions al-Khalili barely touches:

* The Byzantines ruled Greece. How did they lose Greek thought, while the caliphate found it?
* What did we know before the Golden Age? What did we gain from it?

"Greatest" - 'greatest Muslim physicist', 'greatest Indian mathematician', 'greatest clinician ever' - appears 90 times in 250 pages. We are never told what specific achievements earn them the superlative.

al-Kindi:

<blockquote>"We ought not to be embarrassed of appreciating the truth and of obtaining it wherever it comes from, even if it comes from races distant and nations different from us. Nothing should be dearer to the seeker of truth than the truth itself, and there is no deterioration of the truth, nor belittling either of one who speaks it or conveys it."
</blockquote>


It was nice to learn a word for this awesome form of Islam, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%CA%BFtazila">Mu'talizi</a>. (I could have guessed from the kind of person who uses their name as an insult: "In contemporary Salafi jihadism, the epithet or supposed allegations of being a Muʿtazilite have been used between rival groups as a means of denouncing their credibility."

The caliphate was a remarkably open society, for its time. This is only confusing because our received images come from the past few centuries of fundamentalism. Sad:

<blockquote>The Iranian philosopher Abdolkarim Soroush, who is one of the most influential intellectuals in the Muslim world today, has stressed that censorship in today's Muslim world is stronger than at any other time in history.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928">"Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World"</a></h3>

Cal Newport (2016)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Apr 2020<br>
<br>
Quite shallow. He uses himself and Carl Jung as exemplars of the method - "I published 4 books in 10 years" and so on - but why should I judge either of them to have made a positive impact, merely because they published a lot? 

Lots of cherry-picked anecdotes in the normal bad self-help mode, with no attention to <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/">survivorship bias</a>. Deep Work has the same feel as the disgraced <a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/">Why We Sleep</a>: empirically sloppy exaggeration of a plausibly ultra-important topic. Unlike Walker, Newport is not explicitly claiming scientific authority though.

The topic is networked technology as a force against individual productivity. There's a weak and a strong form:



<ul>
<li>Weak: "You need to focus to do great work, or to learn new hard things. And work on the Internet is extremely vulnerable to distraction and tends to be less focussed."</li><br>

<li>Strong: "The always-on fragmentary state of being caused by addictive technology is disabling. It has lasting developmental effects, reducing your attention span, serenity, perspective." (Lanier, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/11/shallows-internet-changing-way-think">Carr</a>.)</li>
</ul>

Newport makes both claims ("Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work."), and the strong one is poorly justified to say the least. But the weak form is plausible and important enough on its own.

I wondered how much this was just a rehash of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology">Flow</a> idea, and in fact Newport does give it its due. It seems fair to update the idea after 40 great years of tech and the culture of tech. (I had no mobile phone until I was 17, no smartphone until I was 27. My abstinence would be much harder now.)

The weak evidence could be forgiven if the claims were weaker, or if the tone was less pompous. Plus two stars for being about an important possibility, minus one for being unrigorous, minus one for tone.

Things I try to do:

* Track your amount of deep work hours every day.<br>
* Protect your morning: get out of bed quickly and don't browse.<br>
* Do "time blocking", earmarking a whole day for focused work<br>
* Batch shallow work (emails, meetings) in one time slots, probably the evening.
* Leave your phone in a different room. 

He talks about scheduling your entire day, which I suspect is perverse. And "become hard to reach" is only possible for people who are already successful / in particular careers. ymmv.

John Darnielle (2012)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Feb 2020<br>
<br>
It's impossible to be the Darnielle completist I am. On top of the maybe 400 commercial objects ("8 to 20 On a Weapons Charge is a bonus track from ~1 copy of Taking the Dative"), there are: a complete but unreleased album, three dozen online-only ephemeral downloads, a hundred covers, a hundred live-only bootleg-only songs, a hundred more known "<a href="https://themountaingoats.fandom.com/wiki/Unreleased_and_Unofficially-Released_Songs">missing</a>" songs, dozens of songs with no attestation but a title <a href="http://www.themountaingoats.net/lyrics/extras_lyr.html">or a verse</a>, and who knows how many more we couldn't snatch from him out of the air. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HttPrN3v1go">Some of his best</a> have been performed exactly once, and probably never again.

There's two good strong pages of JD here, plus his hand in picking and ordering some really ordinary student poetry. It's sort of nice that it's so ordinary; if the bar were higher it would leave people behind, and poetry is now the last place to leave anyone behind. (Except the reader.) It's sort of terrible that the ordinary student art in here will attend much greater success, commanding heights, just because it is in here.

Scott Annett's '<a href="http://scottannett.com/cranes/">Cranes</a>' is quite nice. Alexander Freer's 'Preliminary Communication' is an unsuccessful attempt at my favourite, difficult sort of poem, the bipartite-contrasted-abstract+concrete thingy, more than three words to a line. Felt nothing for the photos.

I was a student writer, in fact more of a student writer than a student. What makes student writing? Earnestness, of course, and the attendant humour gap. An excess of night, nakedness, ribs, blood, pain, the word "fucking" but not much fucking. Syntax shortage. Sensual tongue effects without sensible teeth. Formulas hidden behind frantic formal experiment and pique. Derivativeness as homage. Either sensitive outsiderdom or cartoonish total radicalism or both. 

It's hard to imagine that student writers could get over themselves, could become less clumsy, could settle into themselves, could understand others, could try to actually affect the world. But apparently some do, like Darnielle.

Matthew Walker (2017)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Feb 2019<br>
<br>
[The following review is too credulous: I wrote it before it became clear that the book is at best a noble-lie exaggeration and <a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#appendix-what-do-you-do-when-a-part-of-the-graph-contradicts-your-argument-you-cut-it-out-of-course">at worst statistical</a> fraud with unjustified practical claims. Downgrade your credence in all nonfiction that's outside your expertise, including reviews like this one.]
<br>

Walker:

<blockquote>	Scientists have discovered a revolutionary treatment that makes you live longer. It enhances your memory and makes you more creative. It makes you look more attractive. It keeps you slim and lowers food cravings. It protects you from cancer and dementia. It wards off colds and the flu. It lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke, not to mention diabetes. You’ll even feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious. Are you interested?
</blockquote>


Important topic: he claims there's a free, riskless intervention to add years to your lifespan and fundamentally improve your mind. (The flip side of this claim is a horror story about a society that mentally disables its members.)

Our school system, ladies and gents:

<blockquote>	More than 80 percent of public high schools in the United States begin before 8:15 a.m. Almost 50 percent of those start before 7:20 a.m. School buses for a 7:20 a.m. start time usually begin picking up kids at around 5:45 a.m. As a result, some children and teenagers must wake up at 5:30 a.m., 5:15 a.m., or even earlier, and do so five days out of every seven, for years on end. This is lunacy...

	Previously, we noted that the circadian rhythm of teenagers shifts forward dramatically by one to three hours. So really the question I should ask you, if you are an adult, is this: Could you concentrate and learn anything after having forcefully been woken up at 3:15 a.m., day after day after day? Would you be in a cheerful mood? Would you find it easy to get along with your coworkers and conduct yourself with grace, tolerance, respect, and a pleasant demeanor? Of course not. Why, then, do we ask this of the millions of teenagers and children in industrialized nations?
</blockquote>


And elsewhere he notes that time in school is useless without restfulness. Burn it down.

<blockquote>	Insufficient sleep has also been linked to aggression, bullying, and behavioral problems in children across a range of ages. A similar relationship between a lack of sleep and violence has been observed in adult prison populations; places that, I should add, are woefully poor at enabling good sleep that could reduce aggression, violence, psychiatric disturbance, and suicide
</blockquote>


The theory of sleep (circadian rhythm and adenosine cycle determining when, NREM and REM determining what) is very neat but I'm not qualified to say if it's mature. There's also vast and baffling cross-species variation, which Walker doesn't pretend to understand: "amount (e.g., [hours per day]), form (e.g., half-brain, whole-brain), and pattern (monophasic, biphasic, polyphasic)" or ground / tree.

The adenosine cycle - the absolutely failsafe connection between activity and fatigue - is one of my favourite theories in biology. (The account here doesn't do it justice.)

He's sceptical of <a href="http://gwern.net/Melatonin">oral melatonin</a> <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">therapy</a>, but he doesn't consider the main argument in favour, which is that our many hours of blue-light at night is a systematic deviation from ancestral conditions, with no sensible alternative mitigation (f.lux can only do so much). (He instead puts faith in warm LEDs and smart bulbs, currently thousands of dollars each.) At least he doesn't spread the <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/melatonin/">unsupported idea</a> that taking it results in negative hormonal feedback.  This doesn't surprise me:

<blockquote>
	Scientific evaluations of over-the-counter brands have found melatonin concentrations that range from 83 percent less than that claimed on the label, to 478 percent more than that stated
</blockquote>


- but this is the price of having it over-the-counter in the first place. (It is anyway completely safe to take a 6x dose, just much less effective.)

He's very in favour of afternoon naps, the "biphasic" pattern, based on relatively weak observational evidence:

<blockquote>
	those that abandoned regular siestas went on to suffer a 37 percent increased risk of death from heart disease across the six-year period, relative to those who maintained regular daytime naps."
</blockquote>



There's lots of evolutionary speculation, which really pisses off some readers for some reason, even when tagged as speculation. (e.g. Do teenagers stay up later to procreate outwith parental supervision?)

He is a crusader all right - for instance, he doesn't really do any cost-benefit consideration, instead just maximising sleep, even instead of taking your asthma meds. Yes, the costs of sleep deprivation are extremely high - but so's the cost of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7972077/against-oversleeping">spending 30 years in a coma</a>.

I think I'm pretty much optimised: I already quit caffeine, redshifted all screens, got 0.3mg melatonin, started wearing an eye mask, don't drink much, exercise every day, fixed a bedtime, and live somewhere quiet with big bedroom windows. (I also got a less melodramatic and anxious worldview by studying <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2426950247">economic history</a>, which Walker doesn't cover - fair enough, since the intervention can only help scared intellectuals.) Things which I enjoy enough to handle the sleep cost: nicotine and eating late.

<blockquote>Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep:

1. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.
2. Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. 
3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. 
4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. 
5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. 
6. If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep.
7. Don’t take naps after 3 p.m. 
8. Relax before bed... reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual.
9. Take a hot bath before bed. 
10. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom.
11. Have the right sunlight exposure. Try to get outside in natural sunlight for at least thirty minutes each day.
12. Don’t lie in bed awake... get up and do some relaxing activity until you feel sleepy.

<br>
Good for a YA book. Interesting lore, good structure, inconsistent worldbuilding, portentous/glib tone, painful slang. 

<b>Lore</b>: the Earth hates us, which is why there is so much suffering. Includes a (true) evolutionary gradient:

<blockquote>Earth our father knew He would need clever life, so He used the Seasons to shape us out of animals: clever hands for making things and clever minds for solving problems and clever tongues for working together and clever sessapinae to warn us of danger.  The people became what Father Earth needed, and then more than He needed.  Then we turned on Him, and He has burned with hatred for us ever since.</blockquote>


She later ruins this interesting cosmogony by clubbing you over the head with a message (that the lethal climate shock Seasons started after people polluted the world too much).

The world is a blend of GoT survivalist folk religion and apocalyptically cyclical climate, X-Men despised chaos mages, Battlestar breeding body horror, Earthsea folk magic and wu wei, and superstitious racism. It mostly works.

<b>Structure</b>: Three quite different focal characters, later shown to be the same person over time. I didn't spot the first unification coming, and it was satisfying.

She leaves the big <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">Soylent Green</a> reveal until page 108; until then you're left wondering if all the grey objectification is justified by the terrible security risk. 

She's pretty glib about the two communities outside the Empire, full of earthquake witches who are shown regularly freezing or nuking things when even mildly irked. The utopian pirate community is also heavily rose-tinted - sure, they do kill people in order to take their stuff in a time of terrible scarcity... but hey they're really sexually liberated and not racist at all.

<b>Inconsistent</b>: High Fantasy (subsisting commune agrarians, feudalism, omnipotent wizards) which also boasts C20th science, somehow. An in-universe history book describes one catastrophe as:

<blockquote>"aerosolizing sufficient steam and particulate matter to trigger acidic rain and sky occlusion over the Somidlats..."</blockquote>


They have penicillin without an industrial revolution, electric lights before steam. Ordinary C15th cannon are an experimental wunderweapon to them. 
More: most births have some risk (<1%) of being a giant nuclear volcano generator, but the Evil Empire does nothing to control reproduction, and has the parents administer very insecure self-regulation. 

<b>Pretentious portentousness</b>:

<blockquote>There passes a time of happiness in your life, which I will not describe to you. It is unimportant. Perhaps you think it wrong that I dwell so much on the horrors, the pain, but pain is what shapes us, after all. We are creatures born of heat and pressure and grinding, ceaseless movement. To be still is to be... not.
</blockquote>

Of a character which until about 10 pages earlier had been a despised / tolerated frenemy:

<blockquote>now your eyes are drawn away from the horror that remains of your mentor, your lover, your friend...</blockquote>


I forgive Ada Palmer this style. But 1) she's not that bad; 2) she's aping the sentimentalist C18th, and 3) she has far greater philosophical sense.

<b>Glib</b>:

<blockquote>it turns out that the comm is called Meov, and the man who has stepped forward is Harlas, their headman. 
Also they're pirates.</blockquote>



<blockquote>Syenite mispronounces vulgar words, inadvertently making them more vulgar, and makes instant friends of half the crew by doing so.
</blockquote>


"lol, applause!"

<b>Bad slang</b>: "rogga", "comm", "orogeny" (every time, I thought "erogenous?"), really bad interjections (' "Evil, eating Earth", you whisper'; 'for shit's sake, she stilled a rusting volcano made by a broken obelisk'). The occasional good bit of slang (like "grits" for the young rock mages) is smothered in exposition: that's what she is now, an unimportant bit  of rock ready to be polished into usefulness.... Better writers (Atwood or Le Guin or Banks) leave it up to you. Everything is spelled out here.

The book gets roundly worse in the second half, with two chapters (16 and 17) full of hollow plot devices and applause lights (Damaya only explores the Main building so she can drive the plot forward when the hollow character Binof arrives, immediately afterwards). Also arguably Innon, there to be objectified and let Jemisin write 'good sex' scenes.

Lots of Representation: polyamory, transgenderism, a dozen skin colours. Of course, fantasy doesn't represent anything, so strictly speaking that's a misnomer. It doesn't matter what the ethnic demographics of your lava-world are, relative to ours; you can have as much or as little typical sexuality etc as you like, any colour can be a minority, as long as it makes sense in that world. Do the choices of identities fit Jemisin's world? Is Tonkee's transgenderism, among feudalism, a personal idiosyncrasy? A hormone thing? A magic thing? We're given no reason for any of the identities she introduces to celebrate. But it mostly doesn't get in the way.


Jemisin fumbles the "in a corrupt world, lawful complicity or violent revolution?" angle. At least in this instalment, there's little acknowledgment that killing an entire city because a handful of people in its government committed atrocities isn't on: 'He's not crazy at all, and he never has been' 
"what right do worlds built on oppression and genocide have to exist?", asks one reviewer. Well, 'worlds' (institutions) don't have rights, people do: and people have a right to not suffer harm, e.g. the harm of having a great big earthquake dropped on you.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36317638">"Poverty Safari"</a></h3>

Read this because I am an unironic fan of the author's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdsT0oJIPQM">hip-hop opera</a> about the luridly dystopian consequences of saying 'No' to the Scottish referendum. But it peaks with its epigram, Tom Leonard's "<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DvG30pFX4AAEV2d.jpg">Liason Coordinator</a>".

More of an autobiography than I was expecting, lots about his own insecurities and appalling suffering, the quasi-political rage inspired by them, and his slow maturing into social work and art. Unfortunately the prose is really, really stiff. One of his observations is that poverty makes you unable to articulate poverty. So should I sympathise? I've a similarly uncultured background (though not a tenth as violent) and I still managed to get an ear for High English. (He isn't deep enough to analyse the politics of language, but he namechecks people who do, like Tom Leonard.)

And but you can write in Scots now, if you're great, if you're brave, as shown by Welsh (Booker Prize longlist '93), Kelman (Booker win '94) and Leonard (anthologised in the Penguin Book of English Verse, IMO the highest honour in poetry).

<blockquote>my sense of grievance with anyone I perceived as well-off. In my community, some people fought about football, others over politics and religion, but my simmering resentment, if not concentrated completely on my mother, lay with those in society who appeared to be doing much better than the rest of us, those who were gliding through life unimpeded by the constraints of poverty and the material disadvantage and self-doubt that comes with it.

This feeling of justifiable anger at the state of things, whether it be my community of even my own life, always led to some form of blame being ascribed to another group in society and, for me, middle class people fitted the bill perfectly. This bee in my bonnett has been a constant and finds expression as a sense of irritation at certain people I assume are posh; I can be irritated by an opinion, an accent, an accessory or an item of clothing...

Many big sociological / psychology claims - some truisms, some false - but almost no citations for either. (e.g. He has this harebrained idea that Florida is a rich high-status place, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_poverty_rate">5 seconds on wiki</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Man">passing familiarity</a> with American memes gives the lie to that.) "according to Wikipedia" is as far as the scholarship goes.

There's a surprising section where he tries to tie Seneca and the other good old lads to modern common sense, to do some genealogy of morals, but he can't carry it.

There is a horror to naive genetic determinism of course, but we are overserved with exemplars of that horror, not least the Nazis. The smiling, innocent <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/">mass harm</a> of excess emphasis on environment is less served.

<br>
Another geno-soldiers-get-invented-banned-and-what-then chin-scratcher. Nearer us in time and space than his Kovacs novels (this isn’t interstellar) – but they’ve still all forgotten us, bar the historians. Morgan lets genetic determinism run away with the plot: everyone’s always explaining themselves with reference to their or others’ “wiring”. At one point the protagonist hears a similarity in two people’s diction and “wondered idly what genes the two men might share”. Also his theme, ‘GM humans as future Other’ gets ponderous inbetween the ultraviolence. But Morgan is always worthwhile: his books suspend the ideological alongside the unhappily sexual alongside big strange guns (e.g. an AIDS pistol, loaded with GM virus ‘Falwell’). More mature in some ways – there’s a feminist imam, and a religious character he doesn’t have violent contempt for – but also a bit busy and contralto. 

Stross and Morgan refer to ‘black labs’ a lot – that is, dastardly underground geneticists. Every single time they did, I wondered what the authors had against Labradors. Sort it out.

Banks was important to me as a boy – The Crow Road, though even darker than his sinister average, offers a sincere and positive vision of atheism – but I’ve been less enthralled on rereading the real-world novels (his scifi feel like instant classics).

Expected to hate it, but it's actually dumb fun if you don't stop and think. Obviously the philosophy (ethical egoism + logical word salad) is toxic (and there's that sex scene...), but it works fine as a trashy yarn, the reader's equivalent of moshing to Rage Against the Machine.

There is exactly one good idea in it: the villain, Ellsworth Toohey is a fake socialist, a grand demagogue, a wolf in sheep's ideology. Because he's actually one of her Übermenschen - a brutal, self-actualised spirit just using socialism - he's thus a Worthy Opponent for her pet mavericks. His role in the book is risibly didactic: "Yes, fine, my heroes are assholes," Rand says, "but look how much worse they are when they pretend to be good!"

<br>
Capital-r-Romantic coming-of-age in the north-east of Scotland. I fit three out four of its demographics (Doric speakers, Aberdeen students, de novo idealist, but not a woman), but this still didn't leave much impact. It is lovely to have a personal literature for your specific time and place - elsewhere for people like me there's half of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/canongate-classic">Canongate</a> and Carcanet. But still.

It catches the excitement of going to uni from the middle of nowhere, after being starved of ideas:

<blockquote>The <a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/images/279Chapel1_rdax_800x521.jpg">grey Crown</a>, that had soared through so many generations above the surge and excitement of youth, had told her that wisdom is patient and waits for her people... In the long Library too - where thought, the enquiring experiencing spirit, the essence of man's long tussle with his destiny, was captured and preserved: a desiccated powder set free, volatile, live at the touch of a living mind - she learned to be quiet... They might clutch at her, these dead men, storming and battering at the citadel of her identity... 

The thought... liberated. She walked in a company. </blockquote>



<blockquote>
There flocked in their hundreds her fellow-students, grave, gay, eager, anxious, earnest, flippant, stupid, and humble and wise in their own conceits, dreamers and doers and idlers, bunglers and jesters, seekers of pleasure and seekers of wisdom, troubled, serene, impetuous, and all inquisitive...

But the gasping forbidden love at the heart of the book is too bland to carry it. Also I hated the Doric being italicised; it felt like a stage wink.

<br>
It's a strange read, bloated, full of chauvinist banter. It's like George Bernard Shaw wrote a script for the 50s sitcom 'Bewitched'. There are only two female characters: a megalomanaical shrew, and a nubile and devoted secretary (it's just there happens to be 7 copies of the latter character).

I appreciate his building up a cynical, scientific-humanist world, then tearing it down abruptly at the start of the second book, where two archangels comment on the scene below.

The Muslim linguist character is interesting but borderline (his differences emphasised, often mocked - his nickname is "Stinky"! - but also brilliant and accepted by all the protagonists):

<blockquote>[Mahmoud] held a vast but carefully concealed distaste for all things American. Their incredible polytheistic babel of religions... their cooking, their manners, their bastard architecture and sickly arts... and their blind, pathetic, arrogant beleief in their superiority. Their women most of all, their immodest, assertive women, with their gaunt, starved bodies which nevertheless reminded him disturbingly of houris (...)</blockquote>


(If that made you cringe you ain't seen nothing. It is so easy to show this book in a terrible light:

<blockquote>Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her own fault. That tenth time - well all right. Give him the heave ho into the bottomless pit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Support for the arts - *merde*! A government-supported artist is an incompetent whore.</blockquote>


)

I read the modern, unabridged cut and regret it. The last two sections are flabby and pretty much skimmable, if not skippable.

(As is my new policy, I read this precisely because it was denounced on the internet. Though it turns out the denouncer is actually <a href="https://www.tor.com/2010/12/10/smug-messiah-robert-a-heinleins-stranger-in-a-strange-land/">a critical fan</a>, and the article is entirely fair.)

Comparison of Dune and SiaSL: Both are didactic as hell. Both use magical superhumans to drive the plot in an otherwise sciency setting. Both use a religion their founders do not believe in to obtain power. Both treat water as sacred. Both include cannibals for similar reasons. However, they are deeply different where it matters: <a href="http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Men-and-things-women-and-people-A-meta-analysis-of-sex-differences-in-interests.pdf">Dune is a thing book, SiaSL is a people book</a>.

Fun to talk about, not to read. There is this section, which is an early prediction of what would happen to British sharecroppers in the coming centuries:

<blockquote>
Your sheep […] that commonly are so meek and so little, now, as I hear, they have become so greedy and fierce that they devour men themselves. They devastate and depopulate fields, houses and towns. For in whatever parts of the land sheep yield the finest and thus the most expensive wool, there the nobility and gentry, yes, and even some abbots though otherwise holy men, are not content with the old rents that the land yielded to their predecessors. Living in idleness and luxury without doing society any good no longer satisfies them; they have to do positive evil. For they leave no land free for the plough: they enclose every acre for pasture; they destroy houses and abolish towns, keeping only the churches – and those for sheep-barns.

Just fine. Plus a half for reusing Miller, a dead man, so well.

This passage was good (maybe need to be there though): what a genetic algorithm feels like from inside -<blockquote>
It builds the investigator, and the investigator looks, but does not know. It kills the investigator. It builds the investigator, and the investigator looks, but does not know. It kills the investigator. It builds the investigator, and the investigator looks but does not know, and it does not kill the investigator. It is not aware of a change, that a pattern has broken. The investigator is aware, and it wonders, and because it wonders it looks, and because it looks, the investigator exceeds its boundary conditions, and it kills the investigator.
It builds the investigator.
Something knows.
The investigator hesitates. A pattern has broken, and it isn’t aware that a pattern has broken, but a part of it is. A part of it grasps at the change and tries to tell the investigator. And the investigator stops. Its thoughts are careful as a man walking in a minefield. The investigator hesitates, knows a pattern has been broken. Breaks it a little more. The dead place becomes better defined. It reaches out, and it does not kill the investigator. The investigator exceeds its boundary conditions, and it does not kill the investigator. The investigator considers the dead space, the structure, the reaching out, the reaching out, the reaching out.
The investigator licks his lips, he doesn’t have a mouth. He adjusts his hat, he doesn’t have a hat. He wishes in a distant way that he had a beer, he has no body and no passion. He turns his attention to the dead space, to the world, to how you solve unsolvable problems. How you find things that aren’t there.

And the awww shiit political implication rant at the end is very satisfying.

What I like about this book is the small stakes - instead of the usual "all the solar system FOREVERRR" it's about the fate of 200 folk on a backwater.

The villain is interesting, implausible: a corporate bushidō deontologist, willing to die for his shareholders. Cyberpunk without cyberpunk's irony.

How does it do as Serious science fiction?

Social development: None. The super aliens also have no society.

Software development: None.

 Actual Science: The aliens change the laws of physics repeatedly (nuclear fusion stops working), but the authors at least try to do counterfactual physics to this. The aliens were fissioning lithium for energy, which seems unlikely but I suppose not impossible.

 Brave, for a writer of taste to write a vampire book, these days. But then in a sense Stross doesn’t give a shit, since he has written a vampire book in which the vampires are literally high-frequency investment bankers who become vampires literally because of high-frequency investment banking. Then there’s his occult computer science (“Magic is a side-effect of certain classes of mathematics… Sensible magicians use computers.”).

Stross is the only writer I know who depicts the corporate/bureaucratic way of life, as well as just its deadening language. Millions of people now spend much of their lives within a structure encouraging this mindset; we need art that knows its vagaries and petty circumlocutions and administrivia. 
So, extra half-point for detailed solidarity with the office drone. And the TVTropes reference.

Odd anti-rationalist fantasy on the model of TH White. (What’s the word for the pre-Tolkien, pre-swords-and-sorcery model of fantasy?) Everything is oblique, from the discussion of Auschwitz at the start, to the Kafkan bureaucracy seated in a pastoral landscape. I admire his portrayal of the totalitarian Administrators: when defeated, they are not destroyed but put in their place. There are also passages like this:

<blockquote>…to achieve the blessed intention, something practical had to be done. Things could not be left in the hands of the Administrators. In the story of man, that had been tried times without number and always it had failed. (The revolving Earth, pitted with its tragedies, cried in a far voice from the midst of space: ‘You cannot leave me to politicians.’)

But administrators are needful, are necessary. To fulfil their high function they work with the cunning of the head. But to leave destiny to the head is to leave the trigger to the finger. And after the trigger is pulled they cry above the desolation – (and the desolation was terrible to behold): ‘We will make a new earth, and share the fruits thereof and the fishes of the deeps.’ But what happens?

The fruit is processed and the salmon is canned.

Cute, simplistic. It’s an important theme, waking up to the vulnerability  of others, but not a very good treatment.

Protagonist is comically unimpressed by his own sudden inexplicable clairvoyance. Very cute, very formulaic, very Urasawa (continuing relevance of childhood, violence, supernatural evil, chuckles) but still works.

<br>
I was ready to call this mean, self-pitying, static - but actually that only applies to the protagonist, Seth. The book knows this about him, Seth knows this about Seth.

The art is almost entirely incidental to the dialogue. Seth’s face in profile, Seth smoking, Seth walking with his wise punk friend; pretexts for endless narration. But the dialogue is interesting enough.

Like many borderline depressives, he comes alive for his hobbies, here obscure old cartoonists.

Charles Clinch Bubb (2010)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2021<br>
<br>
Ancient Greek jokebook with a <a href="https://twitter.com/dril/status/1035218616403128320">heavy dril vibe</a> ("thinking of inventing a new type of person to get mad at on here. maybe people who carry too many keys around.. i dont know yet"). Loads of "doctor doctor!" jokes and absent-minded prof jokes. Most of em are recognisable as jokes (or anyway dumb reversals). Maybe not surprising since our theatre (and so films and so TV) is based on theirs. Then there's stuff like this:

<blockquote>57.  [Someone] advised a pedant who had a child born to him of a slave to do away with the child. He replied, “Bury your own children before you advise me to destroy mine.”</blockquote>


(Is the gag that he views the slave child as an heir, like a RUBE?)

<blockquote>A misogynist bereaved of his wife put on mourning at the funeral. When someone asked, "Who has entered into eternal peace?" he answered, "Me, bereft of this woman."</blockquote>



7 snorts out of 264 jokes.

<blockquote>A miser writing his will appointed himself heir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A pedant asked the price of the clothing of people he met. When his father heard of this and condemned him, he replied, "Father, you have been persuaded by slander and not by a man." 
His father said, "Such a one told me." 
"And did you really give heed to someone who doesn't even possess a cloak worth 50 drachmas?" </blockquote>

<blockquote>Someone reviled a witty fellow: "I had your wife as a free gift." 
He replied, "[By contract] I have to endure her; what did you do to deserve it?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Two pedants were walking together and one of them, seeing a black hen, said, "Perhaps her rooster is dead." </blockquote>

<blockquote>A pedant was writing to his father from Athens and, being vain because he had been educated, he added, "I pray you, seek to be the defendant in a trial for your life so I may show you real public 
speaking."</blockquote>

<blockquote>A pedant, a bald man, and a barber pitched camp in a wilderness and agreed that each should stand watch four hours in turn. It fell to the barber to watch first and the pedant second. For a laugh, he shaved the head of the sleeping pedant, and woke him. Rubbing his head and finding himself bare, the pedant said, "What a worthless fellow that barber is - he woke the bald man instead of me." </blockquote>

<blockquote>A certain person coming to a pedant physician said, "Doctor, when I awake from sleep I have a dizziness for half an hour and then I recover." The physician replied, "Get up after the half hour." </blockquote>

I find the 70s dreary for some reason, not just the visual style and relative poverty, but something deep about information poverty and conformist anti-conformity.

Massive amount of time in pubs with no particular narrative goal. Or: the main narrative goal here is to laud aimless friendship and pubs. The other half is chasing women, ineptly. An epic in length only.

Eugene T. Gendlin (1982)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2018<br>
<br>
2/5 with an asterisk.* A very useful technique, but with very weak scientific backing (but at least he tried!), and but a fairly bad book. 

There are classic self-help red flags:

<blockquote>My philosophy leads to new concepts in physics and biology... Focusing is now a worldwide network... this can seem insane to the rest of our society. How could new realistic ideas and steps arise from the body? This new institution is changing the atomization of society... Unlocking the wisdom of your body... using the body's own life-centered and inherently positive direction and force...
</blockquote>



<blockquote>'Focusing has been crucial for many bodyworkers. I would hope that it would be more widely integrated within the education of Somatics practitioners. - Don Hanlon Johnson, Professor, California Institute of Integral Studies'
</blockquote>

<blockquote>The most important rule for a therapist to observe, while helping someone to focus, is to stay out of the focuser's way... [Soon:] Another agitated, self-destructive emotional spiral was beginning and I interrupted her.
</blockquote>



<blockquote>IF DURING THESE INSTRUCTIONS SOMEWHERE YOU HAVE SPENT A LITTLE WHILE SENSING AND TOUCHING AN UNCLEAR HOLISTIC BODY SENSE OF THIS PROBLEM, THEN YOU HAVE FOCUSED.
</blockquote>



...but also things I know to be true and which aren't in the interest of a therapist / self-help guru to say:

<blockquote>Why doesn't therapy succeed more often? In the rarer cases when it does succeed, what is it that those patients and therapists do? What is it that the majority fail to do? 
</blockquote>



<blockquote>When the revolution in self-help [democratization] takes place and people do these helpful processes with each other, will professional psychotherapy be unnecessary? 
</blockquote>


It did take place, we are they; it didn't change much, because most of it is nonsense. I suppose it is cheaper than the old way.
(There is of course the possibility that he's saying them to disarm me.)

I got incredibly annoyed at him going on about this 'method' for 50 pages without describing it; skip to chapter 4 if you do too. It's roughly

1) Clear your head
2) Pick one problem and just think about it in general ("feel it holistically")
3) Slowly try to find the right words to describe it
4) Switch back between the "felt sense" (2) and your description a bunch.
5) Wonder what it's all about. 
6) Continue until you feel your attitude towards it change.

Is this profound? No. Is it crackpot? Also no.

Also annoying was his dismissing alternative strategies for handling problems, all of which I sometimes like. He belittles 'belittling the problem' (e.g. reminding yourself that others have it worse - which is both noble and effective); 'analyzing' (he rightly belittles Freudian Analysis, i.e. blaming your present state on the nastiest past event that comes to mind, but as if breaking things into subproblems is always a bad idea); just enduring it (often just works for me); lecturing yourself (often works for me because parts of me want to listen). Why is it so hard for writers like this to concede that some things don't work for some people? (They lose authority I suppose.)

Surprising that he's a sincere empiricist, or at least trying to be.

<blockquote>One reason why research is so important is precisely that it can surprise you and tell you that your subjective convictions are wrong... As hard as it was for me to accept the finding that therapy doesn't do the job, research findings can never hurt you. They move you forward.
</blockquote>


<a href="http://www.focusing.org/research_basis.html">This is a list</a> of about 100 studies on the topic (Ctrl+F "Table 1"), no doubt with a terrible file-drawer problem. Total n~=500, probably with a lot of duplication. Measures used are a mix of standard boring ones like PFQ and woo boring ones like Gestalt. 

Gendlin makes a few specific, testable claims (which is always to be encouraged so allow me to hereby present him with his certificate of falsifiability at worst):

* "therapy has better outcomes when clients 'focus". Too vague, but a few of the studies are nominally about this.
* "better functioning of the immune system". Only one mention of immune system in that big chart, for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8126691">this n=76 study</a>, no mention of focusing in the abstract at least.
* successful patients (i.e. one-year outcomes) can be predicted from recordings of "their first two sessions". This would be good and clean evidence that something real is involved. I think the claim refers to <a href="http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp04/nq22908.pdf">this PhD</a>, n=35. It wasn't exactly cross-validated, shall we say.

That review was cursory but tells me enough. (You might think you could just look at clinical practice, 40 years on - which, outside of California, doesn't exactly foreground Gendlin - to get a sense of whether it works as well as he claims. But medicine is too far from a rational system for that.)

The core idea is not insane. It's that there is an equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception">proprioception</a> for your own emotions, and that you can't change anything about yourself except through it. There's a touch of the old Zen problem to it, that you're trying to describe a nonverbal thing in words. But then, most descriptions aren't descriptions of verbal processes - consider e.g. "Succulent plants' dark fixation makes them ideal for air quality control in bedrooms".

What about support from respectable, academic phenomenology? I don't know that there is any such thing. There may be non-propositional, non-procedural knowledge. It wouldn't be surprising - the conscious mind is a relatively small and unskilled thing. It's Gendlin's idea of our apriori and undeluded access to it that's the problem. Gendlin's experiments don't establish the existence or the access. I find it hard to think how to test this, actually. If the epistemology of focusing was real, what would be different about its practitioners? Happiness? Cortisol? Decision speed? I don't know. We are too skilled at deluding ourselves. It would be pretty easy to run an experiment where Gendlinites tried to predict which patients recover, and then check that against normies' predictions.

To be fair, this book isn't his strongest face ("I also want this book to be readable by anyone"). But I'm not grading on intended audience (and I wasn't encouraged by those no-power, pre-Crisis psychology studies either).

Open questions: why should there be any therapy that works in general? Grant that there is bodily knowledge; where is this knowledge stored? The enteric nervous system? Why should introspection work? Theory of mind is for modelling other people so that they can't harm me.

This is all probably harmless; people doing Rogerian listening to each other is unlikely to cause any problems (in fact, since it's free, then if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict">null hypothesis of talk psychotherapy</a> is true, this might be a social improvement; same benefit without the deadweight); he doesn't advocate withdrawal from treatment (pills are completely absent from the picture, actually). And the opportunity cost of trying this is low, because other self-help is worse. Not for me; maybe for you.

* Gendlin seems like a very nice man, he's just not the discoverer of the one neat trick to psychiatry. The emphasis (3 chapters) here on helping others and not just yourself in sweet. His acceptance of the need to do science makes it easier to get at him than at other self-helpists - which makes me feel bad about getting at him and not them.

Only thing that marks this out as a girls' story is the amount of innuendo. Darker than expected, still pretty flat.

Comprehensively formulaic (hero school with wimp protagonist) but it's a likeable formula. None of the consistency or logical stretching you'd want to take it seriously. (How does the hero economy work? Who pays for the destroyed arenas? You might think I'm being petty, but One Punch Man does both the economics and the perverse social dynamics in its stride.)

<br>
Or: "A Story." It's intentionally didactic, but that knowing intention doesn't stop it being annoying. Found myself reading it just to see what Pullman's next revision would be (e.g, Joseph being bullied into taking the teenage Mary for a wife).

<blockquote>"I remember him," said the blind man. "Jesus. He come here on the Sabbath, like a fool. The priests wouldn't let him heal anyone on Sabbath. He should've known that."

"But he did heal someone," said the lame man. "Old Hiram. You remember that. He told him to take up his bed and walk."

"Well what was the use of taking his living away? Begging was the only thing he knew how to do. You and your blether about goodness," he said, turning to Christ, "where's the goodness in throwing an old man out into the street without a trade, without a home, without a penny? Eh? That Jesus is asking too much of people."

Compassionate, subtler than the title suggests, dull.

Drunk or ex-drunk Anglos bitch around Rome. Some of the literary references are a bit much (“The boy was reading Stendhal; how bad could he be?”) but the nasty driving fatigue underneath is good. Has a really ugly binding and font, so I’ve compensated the score in case I am shallow.

<br>
Post-apocalyptic Morayshire folk do Cold War survivalism before the Cold War? I was of course primed to love this, but it's a lead ball of a book, drab and flattened. This probably makes it a brilliant picture of the era's background of vast fear, but that doesn't make for a good read. The three characters are just scared, and though their hardships are harsh indeed, they're oddly unaffecting. The political economy that drove them out there is completely absent, only represented by sketched armed thugs. Nor is the world-justifying love of the central couple convincing, either. So it's tragic, but in no meaningful or honourable way. 

The prose does sometimes have a lovely Doric lilt - "We were but young in stealth. As we drove along the Spey, the silent night was full of ears that harkened to our passing. It was midnight when our second journey ended, and dark, dark." 
- and local loons will get a kick out of it.

Very enjoyable still.

The admirable parts here are the tiny fraction of the conflict that the aliens cause; all the rest (95%) is humans backstabbing humans.


How does it do as Serious science fiction?

Social development: Belters are still too roughly sketched. How can they work? Not IRA-style cells plus official deniability, not military hierarchy, no discussion of their democracy, just Fred Johnson the guerilla tsar...

Software development: Little unless you count ascended-Miller.

 Actual Science: Treatment of momentum and dynamics is good, besides of course the Wormhole Stargate thing.

Surprisingly acerbic! The advertised Scandinavian pop silliness is present, but tamped down nicely by the Gulliver's Travels satire: a man blown around by the mad political convulsions of the past century. 

Key tension: the book's main target is people in the grip of political ideologies. The eponymous Allan is held up as a model exception: possessing sensible, apolitical, unfashionable grit and humour. But Allan ends up enabling atrocities: he saves Franco's life in '39! He gives Stalin the bomb! Are we supposed to conclude, against the narrator and protagonist, that political neutrality is actually a horror? Jokes were ok, this tension was good.


In one sentence: You shouldn't underestimate old people or hurt anyone over politics, lol.

In the form that survived, Scots is a uniformly profane language – not in the sense of profanity, but as in worldly and comic and demotic. Some of that opinion is classist stereotype; it certainly wasn't true four hundred years ago (the devotional poems of <a href="http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/conlee-dunbar-complete-works-poems-devotional-and-moral">Dunbar</a> and Henryson stand up to the sacred efforts in any language); but most is real, down to Knox's decision on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Bible">a legally-mandatory bible in English</a>, but even more to the cultural capture of the nation’s Anglicised elites, but even more than that to the simple dictates of shared economic activity, over three hundred years: i.e. we gave English our sacred talk, then we gave English our intellectual talk, and then trade talk, and law talk, and all their formal accoutrements. Until only the informal and proletarian was left. Atweill, the kitsch prevails (“Hoots ma wee bonnie lassie! Ahiiii wid wauk fyv hhundrid myles”).  When Lorimer wrote this, the dialectisation of Scots, and the cutesy granny-aff-a-bus process wasn’t so advanced - but this is the register we moderns read it in, unless we are rural and lucky.

(Nasty but probable thing I once heard a linguist lecture on: relatively few languages develop the scientific-philosophical register and benefit from its sharpening vocabularies. He reckoned that only nine ever have, fully: Chinese, Arabic, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Russian, German, French, English. Scots definitely had speakers sophisticated enough, in its High Medieval heyday, but the internationalist use of Latin precluded it.)

Lorimer saw a Bible translation as one of two conditions of revitalising braid Scots - the language, rather than the dialect Scots English. (The other big brick being <a href="http://www.dsl.ac.uk/">the Dictionary</a>.) Well, we have both now, and they are not enough. The argument for bringing back languages is only superficially humane, since language is for communication first, and our condition is more and more a global one. (I find it difficult to fault <a href="http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/agreeable-ways-to-disable-your-children/">Katja Grace’s analysis</a>: the standard arguments fail, the present matters more than the past: because it is where value happens.) 

Lorimer translated it straight from the Koine Greek over a full decade, finishing the second draft just before his death. The art comes in his rendering the apostles with their own voice and distinctive idiolect. (Paul is, here as ever, a nasty little man: smug and litigious.) While I’m very glad this exists, the book itself can do little for me, whatever language it’s wearing. (Nothing takes me further from religious awe than the actual things we said God said. Hauflin’ indeed.)

<br>
Wise but wearing bildungsroman, full with super-Romantic sincerity. Joanna’s life is about embracing pleasure and freedom, but is suffused with the bible; even living godlessly, J thinks in its language and punishes herself in its mood. 

Unconventionally emotional: while she doesn’t love her husband (“What they had was not love, but it had beauty, and it served.”) and doesn’t grieve her mother’s death, Joanna (and Carswell) are brimming with strange new emotions: at one point she’s thrilled to ecstasy by a dripping tap. (“It was the still small voice of a new birth, of a new life, of a new world… For it was the voice before creation, secure, unearthly, frail as filigree yet faithful as a star.”) 

Ornamented, worthy, but hard work. Probably important.
