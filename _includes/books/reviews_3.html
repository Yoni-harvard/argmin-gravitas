<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41210706)">"Surprisingly Down to Earth, and Very Funny: My Autobiography"</a></h3>

Limmy (2019)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Feb 2019<br>
<br>
Auto theft, fanny fright, incompetent but dogged self-harm, raving and tripping as self-medication, dole stupor, bail skipping, the death drive, pretend machismo, pretend homosexuality, alcoholism, Flash animation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limmy%27s_Show">BBC showrunner</a>. Not very funny but very entertaining. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOZzFXolGJc">His shows are funny.</a>)  

I could have guessed that he'd had a life like this from his characters; so much authentic idiocy, lunacy, awkwardness, pretension, and pettiness. Surprised that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0f-2P3luxU">Dee-Dee</a> is based on his own trippy blankness; Limmy's so sharp these days.

He crosses into the middle class through IT, anxious about looking like the 'wee ned guy' in the office. And then into Design (a colony of the Art world, where a rough background's a bonus), and then to TV comedy, and then to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/brianlimond">streaming</a>, where rawness and obliquity and patter means dollas. It's a nice story.

It's about being strange in a normal, subclinical* way: intrusive thoughts, groundless anxiety, reduced affect display, auditory hallucination, mild paranoia, misanthropy, hysteroid dysphoria.

<blockquote>I must sound like a fuckin robot tae you. But it's just the way I'm wired. I never felt sad about my mum dying.<br>   
 
I always wondered if I was schizophrenic... Maybe just an overactive imagination. My mind likes to come up wi lots of thoughts and ideas, whether or no they're useful or make sense. I think that sort of thing can make you mental, depending on how severe it is and what kind of environment you're in. Fortunately I managed to find a place to put my kind of mind to good use.
</blockquote>


The deep function of laughter is apparently that it <a href="https://provine.umbc.edu/books/laughter-a-scientific-investigation/">allows play / boundary learning / questioning social norms</a>. So to be a comedian, you have be a step past your society. (I doubt funniness is linear in weirdness though.) And Limmy is obviously out there. He regularly tweets about how much he misses drinking (which I've never seen an alcoholic do), and satirises the now-daily flamewars of the shouting classes by taking absurd and alternating stances on every issue (...) .

I know several people with the same mix of terrible impulses and good intentions, charisma and anti-social solitude: folk whose adolescence lasted twenty years. They're the funniest people I know, by far. I don't know how class comes into it, but they're all working-class. Maybe middle-class people as strange as them direct it inward, rather than outward as comedy or violence. (They're also all Scots but that's a selection effect, I hope.) 

Audiobook's worth it - the prose is very plain and his accent's strong but clear. Fans only, but you should be a fan.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5130)">"Island"</a></h3>

Aldous Huxley (2002)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2015<br>
<br>
His last book: a half-rational vehicle for his late contrarian mystical worldview; in fact it reads as his making amends for the vivid bioconservative paranoia of Brave New World. It certainly handles the same themes, simply inverted in their consequences: we see drugs as enablers of enlightenment; a much healthier view of suffering, as a pointless trap; a surprisingly pragmatic view of genetic engineering; and a very balanced view of civilisation and economic development. 

So: he constructs a Taoist-Hindu-Buddhist utopia which mostly avoids primitivism and annoying mysticism for a sustainable East plus West non-industrial modernity. It's not my idea of paradise, but other people's utopias usually aren't. Moreover, it is a doomed utopia nestled in nasty 1950s international political economy. The animating enemy of Island is not the authoritarian consequences of technology, but what Scott Alexander <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">calls Moloch</a>: the forces of self-fulfilling inevitability and destructive competition.

Protagonist is a mirror of John the Savage: an open-minded liar and shill, a fallen outsider who manages to undermine the utopia he infiltrates. Huxley himself is the model for him: in fact we can see Will's journey from cynical aestheticism to materialist spirituality as autobiography in allegory. The mystic character, Rani, is amazing: an enraging theosophical flake. This reflects well on Huxley's own weirdness: the Rani is as far from traditional organised religion as Huxley is from her.

Given the times and his project, lots of Huxley's worldview have <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">become clichés</a>: e.g. “you forget to pay attention to what's happening. And that's the same as not being here and now ”. The prose is arch and syrupy but I like it. (BNW is saddled by the air of a smug jeremiad. Island is every bit as didactic but nowhere near as smug.) It's chock-full of bad poetry though. I love his use of reported speech to denote characters he disrespects: this saves him the bother of writing it and us the bother  of reading and makes a conspiracy of us and Huxley:

<blockquote>
	He turned to Will and treated him to a long and flowery farewell. 

<br>In polysyllables, Mr Bahu hedged diplomatically. On the one hand, yes; but on  the other hand, no. From one point of view, white; but from a different angle, distinctly black.</blockquote>



Pala's structure is cool but not at all radical enough to solve what is wrong with us, I think – technology is controlled very carefully and considered one of the 'dozens' of fronts to aid people on. (Hypnotherapy and tantra are given way more credit than they deserve, for instance.) Is “one-third” of suffering intrinsic? I look forward to science seeing if that is the case. I elect Huxley into the hall of fame of people who make a very popular error and later recant to no acclaim. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model">Niels Bohr</a> (and his memetically dominant false model), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument#Frank_Jackson">Frank Jackson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Gide#Russia">André Gide</a>, Bertrand Russell, ...)


* Can we call a novel mistaken? As a whole, not in some particular claim of a character. No. 'Misguided', or ideologically harmful, maybe.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37925095)">"Learn Python 3 The Hard Way"</a></h3>

Zed A. Shaw (n)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2018<br>
<br>
Much, much more my style - opinionated, joined-up, irreverent - though not my speed ("this book gives you the mental tools and attitude you need to go through most Python books and actually learn something"). Shaw is a beautiful mind in a slightly unhinged shell:

<blockquote>Which programming language you learn and use doesn't matter. Do not get sucked into the religion surrounding programming languages as that will only blind you to their true purpose of being your tool for doing interesting things.

Programming as an intellectual activity is the only art form that allows you to create interactive art. You can create projects that other people can play with, and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art form is quite this interactive. Movies flow to the audience in one direction. Paintings do not move. Code goes both ways.

Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food joint. You're much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession. People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.</blockquote>


A good way to spend an hour after a year away.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43248485)">"What is the Last Question?"</a></h3>

John Brockman (2018)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2019<br>
<br>
List of 284 questions - some of them kind of daffy or parochial ("will we ever be able to predict earthquakes?", "What would comprise the most precise sonic representation of the history of life?"), some of them profound, about half of them interminably nerdsniped by this thing called consciousness, exactly 12 of them about what I'd answer. ("Will AI make the Luddites right?", "Is it possible to control a system capable of evolving?", "What can humanity do right now that will make the biggest difference over the next billion years?", "Can an increasingly powerful species survive the actions of it's most extreme individuals?")

A few of them are answered already (to my satisfaction), e.g. "Why are people seldom persuaded by clear evidence and rational argument?", "Is love really all you need?", "Are feelings computable?", "Why do even the most educated people today feel that their grip on what they can truly know is weaker than ever before?", "Was agriculture a wrong turn?". But then the list is an accurate picture of how compartmentalised and undiffused much of the greatest knowledge is among intellectuals.

(But the prompt is not "what's the most important question?" nor "what question do we most need answered?" so ignore my judging.)

Too broad for PhDs, often too broad for entire careers, but inspiring and sharpening anyway.

Paul Ziff (1984)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2011<br>
<br>
<blockquote>I know that there is no [demiurge], but what if I were wrong? I am not, but I could be, but I am not, though I may be.

A wall has been built, and it is being built; we think it will continue to be built. No one knows exactly who started the wall, though many have helped. Nor does anyone know how far it reaches: it seems to go on and on forever. We think the builders are our principals.

The wall is to protect us from the invasion. Wall soldiers man the wall. Whenever a soldier is overcome by an invader, he must be replaced by a stronger soldier, & we are forever sending replacements. We have even sent soldiers to man the wall in the distant provinces. No one knows how strong the enemy forces are there. We need as many soldiers as we can get, but we want only those who are strong enough to repel an invader. It is possible that there is a man strong enough to repel an invader. We know if a man isn't strong enough if he is overcome by an invader. But if he is not, we don't know whether it is because he is strong enough, or good fortune has kept stronger invaders away.

We have found a section of the wall where the invaders are too strong for anyone weaker than K. So we know that no man weaker than K will do there. For the time being we risk it: we judge that K is strong enough. Perhaps someday K may have to be replaced. Yes, we know that.
Meanwhile we stare at the long reaches of the wall and wonder.

I no longer find coherentism even the kind of thing that would constitute an answer to the question "what is knowledge? / what is justification?". But this is so beautiful.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5115533)">"Statistics: A Very Short Introduction"</a></h3>

David J. Hand (2008)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2019<br>
<br>
Was looking for a qualitative introduction to convey something of the excitement and philosophical importance - the art of discovering anything which isn't bleedin' obvious! nor knowable apriori! This has bits of that ("Statistics is applied philosophy of science"; "it is the technology for handling uncertainty") but is still too dry to recommend as a first exposure. 

He diagnoses the worst parts of university teaching: hand calculations, canned inference, and the (exhausting, interminable) bag-of-tools approach, rather than computers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_mixed_model">The Framework</a>. But the latter have steep learning curves. I think the biggest thing missing is simple tailoring of datasets: let them pick something they care about to study, to learn how to study on. 

Lots of ML methods covered, without a single mention of the phrase "machine learning". This is fair enough if you consider how much of (enterprise) ML hype is just rebranded 40 year old stats.

Hand notes the origins of the field - as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_statistics#Etymology">State-istics</a>, i.e. as the beginning of bureaucracy and surveillance. But he doesn't feel the tension of this fact: that it helped to transform us, for good and ill, into <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">legible people</a>.

One dodgy idea: he claims that numbers offer a more direct apprehension of reality than words, that they're realer. But this isn't why they're better: they're better because they're more sensitive - it's at least possible for them to track any size change in the world, while words are mostly stuck to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/2c5cna/jl_austins_middlesized_dry_goods/">medium-sized dry goods</a> - and because they are easier to spot errors in.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25499718)">"Children of Time (Children of Time, #1)"</a></h3>

Adrian Tchaikovsky (2015)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2018<br>
<br>
Initially, this looked like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_(science_fiction)">Brin</a> rip-off, or a <a href="https://www.tor.com/2011/01/11/so-high-so-low-so-many-things-to-know-vernor-vinges-a-deepness-in-the-sky/">Vinge</a> rip-off, or even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(Discworld)#Structure_and_technology">Pratchett</a> rip-off. And the prose is just serviceable. Title sucks too. 

But it blooms: the long evolutionary pathway it follows - from a spider jeeust 'thinking' that pack hunting might be a good idea, to a full manned space program - is excellent. The alternative technological route is the great bit - what would industry look like without fossil fuel, a mechanised society without metal? - and the protagonist spiders who find the route are easy to empathise with. 

Ants are used as robots, factories, laboratories, and eventually as CPUs:

<blockquote>There are hundreds of tamed ant colonies within Great Nest, not counting those in the surrounds that undertake the day-to-day business of producing food, clearing ground or fending off incursions of wild species. Each colony has been carefully trained, by subtle manipulation of punishment, reward and chemical stimulus, to perform a specific service, giving the great minds access to a curious kind of difference engine.
</blockquote>



{over-literal bull-shit}
(Tchaikovsky overstates massively the potential of ants as a processing channel, though - witness the giant leap in practicality from ~1cm mechanical relays to (even the crappiest) fully-electronic vacuum-tube. Nothing so slow and large as an ant colony could carry out much logic-gate work without taking much longer than a human-level worker and anyway accumulating huge errors.)
\{/over-literal bull-shit}

 (Their bioengineering stuff is actually more realistic than Vinge's spiders' breakneck 50-year sprint through the C20th and C21st centuries, even if you include the Uplifting virus. This is because Vinge's telling is deterministic - they discover all the same stuff as us, in mostly the same order - and their culture a cartoon of ours.) 

His other successful theme is incomprehension: females not understanding male liberation, spiders not understanding how a depressed solitary human could be sentient, Kern not understanding anything. (Mostly the spider gender politics are boring, just <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutionFlip">bizarro patriarchy</a> with a cannibal twist.)

The main antagonist, the mad hubristic scientist starts off dull and strawish (why did it take 300 years for her to ask what rough genus the spiders were?) but the moment she stops that stuff and reaches across the species barrier is quite beautiful.

Also, Tchaikovsky often drops out of the Spiders' worldview mid-sentence to telegraph what you, a human, should be thinking of all this (an example is the use of "curious" in the passage above). 

The humans are less interesting, fairly stock generation-shippers. There is this inversion, that the scholar of dead languages is Key Crew, plot-critical all the time:

<blockquote>To study and laud those antique psychopaths during the Earth's last toxic days had seemed bad taste. Nobody liked a classicist.
</blockquote>



Anyway worthwhile, momentarily dazzling.

***

How does it do as Serious science fiction?

Social development: Lots. The spiders' matriarchal anarchism is shown with realistic downsides. The ark ship humans go through several revolutions and regressions.

Software development: Some, but all pretty high-level. Thousands of years of uptime for some systems, with only hints at how to keep it going. Some nice linguistic archaeology.

Actual Science: Mostly evo bio, little bit of computer science and crypto maybe.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18581690)">"The Gervais Principle: The Complete Series, with a Bonus Essay on Office Space (Ribbonfarm Roughs)"</a></h3>

Venkatesh G. Rao (2013)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2019<br>
<br>
A fun, nasty, bitchy taxonomy of social class / psychological theory of the firm; a mishmash of economics, psychoanalysis and literary criticism; a series of massive blogposts apologising for being a book. 

It splits employed people into three classes with terrible names - Leaders ("Sociopaths"), Loyalists ("Clueless"), Workers ("Losers") - and throws a massive amount of fictional evidence at each. That's obviously a formal hierarchy, Leaders > Loyalists > Workers, but Rao's first big left turn is to impose a second contradictory ordering on the 3 classes in developmental psychology terms: Clueless < Losers < Sociopaths. I like his subdivision of Losers into: Minimum-effort rationally-disengaged; Overperformers; future Sociopaths. It looks nasty, and Rao is uninterested in making it seem moral or immoral, but if this is how the leaders actually think, Rao is doing us (the 99%) a service. 

Is this system justified and true? No. Rao writes the best clickbait in the world, what he calls "insight porn".It is the verbal equivalent of the noise an F1 engine makes on a 200m straight. The class theory in this would make for a great literary theory, a blueprint for future Office Spaces. Myers-Briggs is marginally better than the dumb view of people as more or less defective versions of one character. So too is this better than "bosses/workers" cod Marxism. 

(He could have massively increased his audience and reduced unwanted connotations by renaming "Losers" to "Workers"

<blockquote>the Loser — really not a loser at all if you think about it — pays his dues, does not ask for much, and finds meaning in his life elsewhere
</blockquote>

)

He has a weird relationship with the amoral elites - he often says things like

<blockquote>
In the big games of life, those involving the Darwinian dimensions of sex, money or power, we don’t get to define the rules. And it is only those games that can create social value.
</blockquote>


putting destiny and ultimate value in their hands. And he clearly thinks of himself as a post-reality-shock enlightened figure. And yet he rags on the inauthenticity, nihilism, cruelty, hollowness of his 'Sociopaths'.

There are dozens of acute, contentious, boggling passages like

<blockquote>
For high-empathy people, all this is natural. By participating in collective feeling in groups of any size, and reacting to basic attraction/aversion drives, you can actually safely navigate all the complexity by instinct.
Not only can you do this, you will actually feel good doing this. This feeling is called happiness. I don’t have time to go into this, but happiness is entirely a social phenomenon, and there’s plenty of evidence that the best way (and from my reading, the only way) to get happy is to get sociable. Non-social feelings that seem like happiness turn out, upon further examination, to be distinct emotions like contentment, equanimity or hedonistic pleasure
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
the level of abstraction that we are concerned with, all theories of developmental psychology – Freud’s, Piaget’s, Erikson’s, Maslow’s – say roughly the same thing about arrested development: you are born Clueless and clue up in fits and starts. Bits of you get stuck and left behind at different points, and eventually you exhaust your capacity for real change and stall (though you may retain an illusion that you are on a path of “lifelong growth and learning,” itself a pattern of arrested development)
</blockquote>



I can imagine a teenager reading this and becoming absolutely insufferable. But much great writing can lend spurious superiority to fools - for instance Nietzsche.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23346490)">"Zero To One"</a></h3>

Peter Thiel (2001)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2018<br>
<br>
What we hate about business books is their clichés, their fawning, their Panglossian grin, their being completely invalid because they don't consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a>, and their prose. This one avoids all these things and is radical in an unconventional way.*

It's hard to know what to think of Thiel. He's easy to demonise - much easier than his loudmouth peer Musk. For instance, he's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship">anti-college</a>, anti-affirmative-action, anti-Clinton - and even openly anti-competition! (And <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/29604-parabiosis-peter-thiel-blood">a vampire</a>!)

But I've been impressed with his clarity and sense of proportion <a href="https://www.weltwoche.ch/ausgaben/2018-29/artikel/en-hypnotische-massenphanomene-die-weltwoche-ausgabe-29-2018.html">in</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/patrissimo/status/1026803467279581184">interviews</a>, and nowhere here did I find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard">Girardian</a> anti-humanist conservatism that Gawker, Vulture, Vox, (...) made me expect. 

For instance, this spiel moves me every time I hear it - the billions of hours we steal from children every year:

<blockquote>We teach every young person the same subjects in the same ways, irrespective of individual talents and preferences. Students who don’t learn best by sitting at a desk are made to feel somehow inferior, while children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up defining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality.

And it gets worse as students ascend to higher levels of the tournament. Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking. For the privilege of bring turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation. Why are we doing this to ourselves?
</blockquote>



and similarly plaintive and humane bits:

<blockquote>Why work with a group of people who don’t even like each other? Many seem to think it’s a sacrifice necessary for making money. But taking a merely professional view of the workplace, in which free agents check in and out on a transactional basis, is worse than cold: it’s not even rational. Since time is your most valuable asset, it’s odd to spend it working with people who don’t envision any long-term future together. If you can’t count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work, you haven’t invested your time well—even in purely financial terms. 
</blockquote>



He is simply not simple. There are four positive references to Marx, four to Zuckerberg; two to Shakespeare, two to Bezos. He is a revisionist, then, intolerable to one side and oddly scathing about the other. (The chapter which translates Google's public rhetoric is not complimentary, for instance.) His niche seems to be the repugnant but true. So, like Taleb without the bluster and boasting. Which feels bizarre, like I'm in a different timeline where Taleb is actually aiming to not alienate a mass audience.

He says true things about things I know about: the history of economic thought (Walras did indeed lift the formalism of general equilibrium from physics) and the deadened air of contemporary Political Philosophy. His contribution to Trump's campaign was risible and maybe a defection against the world - but notice that even this lapse speaks to his ability to find unexpected truths - <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/">FiveThirtyEight gave</a> an 80% chance of a Clinton win at that point. So maybe his analysis and helpful checklist for startups are true too.

It's a shame few critics of capitalism will read this - for he is one, in his way:

<blockquote>Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines. Actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition, all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: If you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.</blockquote>



(Of actually-existing capitalism I mean.)


How on earth can you argue that monopolies give more social utility than high competition? First, distinguish three kinds: 1) criminal saboteurs and antitrustees (Apple); 2) government-licenced pets (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_US_dealership_disputes">US car dealers</a>, the East India Companies); and 3) "creative monopolies" who gain their massive market share by doing something much, much better than everyone else. Obviously only the latter is good for society. 

I was recently rushing to the airport, and pulled the quickest route (via underground via train via foot) from Google Maps. On the way, I noticed a sign in the Tube and realised that actually a different line was a much shorter route. So I walked 10 mins to that line, to find, of course, that it was suspended all weekend and, consequently, that Google is better at my life than I am. This is what he means.


He goes further and says that the spare resources and vision of a creative monopoly is the source of innovation and so

<blockquote>
Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.
</blockquote>



The model is structurally the same as the old one about the Agrarian revolution: farms meant that for the first time, not everyone had to work full-time on food production, which let them specialise in other roles (war, gods, justice, lore) and eventually - slowly - invent new things.

Even so, I thought of an alternative road to dynamism, given perfect competition and so no profits: competition leads to low prices, which leads to savings, which are pooled into investment funds, which give entrepreneurs the same kind of space (and potentially the long view) that profits do.

Other people would not use the word "monopoly", trying to manage the connotations, trying to persuade us by smoothing things over. This is not Thiel's strategy.

One chapter argues that "Success is not just luck", mostly on the back of the existence of serially successful entrepreneurs (it is plausible that once could be luck, and plausible that one success brings massive funding, deserved or not. It isn't plausible that someone could dumbly blunder into 3 billion-dollar executions, even given the easy ride for the second and third). It pains me slightly to admit the latter, because it tints <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2521302674?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">my otherwise complete loathing of Steve Jobs</a>.

<b>Misc notes</b>

* He notes that the term "developed nations" is a sign of our lack of ambition, of a premature, smug, quasi-willed halt.

* The dot-com boom was even crazier than you thought:

<blockquote>A South Korean firm wired us $5 million without first negotiating a deal or signing any documents. When I tried to return the money, they wouldn't tell me where to send it.
</blockquote>



* It is not yet clear whether killing Gawker was good or bad. Either way, like his Trump donation, you must acknowledge the sheer gall and direction.

* One should do a Straussian (between-the-lines) reading of anyone smart, conservative and public, because there will be a lot that's unsayable. I don't care to.

<blockquote>The few who knew what could be learned, 
Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show,

These we have always crucified and burned.

* Actually hold on. The man's a transhumanist, an anti-school radical, a funder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading#The_Seasteading_Institute">one of our only</a> large-scale experiments in urban planning or libertarianism, a rationalist. Why do we call him a conservative?

"Zero to One" sounds like the usual kind of motivational crap, except that it's actually a good illustration of his maxim of creative monopoly ("0 -> 1 is much, much better than 1 -> n"). And the subtitle "How to build the future" is not figurative and not petty: he cites Bostrom's trajectories about the ultimate fate of the universe - and is only focussed on technology because that's what will get us past the Rise and Fall trap, the stagnation trap and the extinction trap.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/727552)">"Philosophy and Computing"</a></h3>

Luciano Floridi (1999)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2014<br>
<br>
Whistle-stop hyperbole in the way of Continentals, but grounded by technical knowledge and uncliched. (Owing to its techno-optimism: it is uncliched to be a philosopher optimistic about tech.)

<blockquote>The history of modern thought has been characterised by an increasing gap between mind and reality. It is a process of epistemic detachment which has been irresistible ever since it began, and quite inevitably so. Knowledge develops as mind’s answer to the presence of the non-mental. It is the means whereby the subject establishes a minimal distance, and emancipates itself, from the object. The rise of dualism and the escalating interaction between traditional knowledge, as an object, and innovative knowledge, as a further reaction to it, has led to the emergence of a new world.
</blockquote>



Notice the skilled and non-fatuous use of phenomenological blah! Chapter 2, his fast and very formal discussion of Boole, Gödel and Turing, took me about half a week. The tiny concluding chapter – in which he locates computers in the history of human freedom, as Hephaestean handmaids – makes me giddy. Slightly dated where it talks PC specs, and he loves a goofy neologism (“egology”, “corporeal membranes”), but grand, sceptical, grand, supervenient. 


(His ‘<a href="http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/publications/pdf/tinopi.pdf">Informational Nature of Personal Identity</a>’ and ‘<a href="http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/11646/906518.pdf?sequence=2">Turing’s Three Lessons</a>’ are better.)

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57233)">"Leonardo's Mountain of Clams and the Diet of Worms: Essays on Natural History"</a></h3>

Stephen Jay Gould (1999)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2017<br>
<br>
Start by listing Gould's virtues: passionate about paleontology and paleontologists, contagiously curious about nature and obscure history, scrupulously fair to the religious and the pre-modern, animated by justice. For an academic, his prose is highly flavoursome and fun. He has a considered opinion about Darwin's handwriting and the meaning of baseball. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_for_Brontosaurus">One</a> of his essay collections was very important to me as a teen, showing me that I could unify truth-seeking and justice-seeking, and with style. 

But this is all countermanded, because he is just <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/kv/beware_of_stephen_j_gould/">not trustworthy</a> <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_earthling/1996/11/homo_deceptus.html">on human</a> <a href="http://www.umsl.edu/~carrolljc/Documents%20linked%20to%20indiex/IN_LIT_DAR/Critique_of_Gould.pdf">topics</a>, and <a href="http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/CEP_Gould.html">neither on</a> core evolutionary theory, I'm told. From his enormously influential, fallacious dismissal of intelligence research in general and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/science/14skull.html?_r=1">Morton in particular</a>, to his dishonest coup of public discourse over punctuated equilibrium (pushing the flashy and revolutionary version in literary magazines, retreating to minimal and uncontentious forms in the science journals who could actually evaluate it), he muddied the waters even as he brandished real literary talent and noble political intentions. This is unforgiveable: empirical clarity is too rare and precious to sacrifice so. 

Maynard Smith: <blockquote>Gould occupies a rather curious position, particularly on his side of the Atlantic. Because of the excellence of his essays, he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the preeminent evolutionary theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists. All this would not matter, were it not that he is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory.</blockquote>


<a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/evolute.html">Krugman</a>:
<blockquote>Gould is the John Kenneth Galbraith of his subject. That is, he is a wonderful writer who is beloved by literary intellectuals and lionized by the media because he does not use algebra or difficult jargon. Unfortunately, it appears that he avoids these sins not because he has transcended his colleagues but because he does does not seem to understand what they have to say; and his own descriptions of what the field is about - not just the answers, but even the questions - are consistently misleading. His impressive literary and historical erudition makes his work seem profound to most readers, but informed readers eventually conclude that there's no there there.</blockquote>


Tooby and Cosmides:
<blockquote>We suggest that the best way to grasp the nature of Gould's writings is to recognize them as one of the most formidable bodies of fiction to be produced in recent American letters. Gould brilliantly works a number of literary devices to construct a fictional "Gould" as the protagonist of his essays and to construct a world of "evolutionary biology" every bit as imaginary and plausible as Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. Most of the elements of Gould's writing make no sense if they are interpreted as an honest attempt to communicate about science (e.g., why would he characterize so many researchers as saying the opposite of what they actually do) but come sharply into focus when understood as necessary components of a world constructed for the fictional "Gould" to have heroic fantasy adventures in...

 "Gould" the protagonist is a much loved character who reveals himself to be learned, subtle, open-minded, tolerant, funny, gracious to his opponents, a tireless adversary of cultural prejudice, able to swim upstream against popular opinion with unflinching moral courage, able to pierce the surface appearances that capture others, and indeed to be not only the most brilliant innovator in biology since Darwin, but more importantly to be the voice of humane reason against the forces of ignorance, passion, incuriousity, and injustice. The author Gould, not least because he labors to beguile his audience into confusing his fictional targets with actual people and fields, is sadly none of these things.

Yet in the final analysis, there are genuine grounds for hope in the immense and enduring popularity of Gould. Gould is popular, we think, because readers see in "Gould" the embodiment of humane reason, the best aspirations of the scientific impulse. It is this "Gould" that we will continue to honor, and, who, indeed, would fight to bring the illumination that modern evolutionary science can offer into wider use. </blockquote>


Here is a fictional leaf from Gould's ad hominem book, to give you a sense of what he does, at his worst:

<blockquote>Gould is famed for the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which holds that adaption and speciation is not generally a slow, gradual process measurable in tens of thousands of year periods, but instead a rapid response to environmental shocks, measurable in hundred-year periods. The political bias of this theory is too blatant to ignore: as a Marxist, Gould requires that sustainable change be possible by revolution rather than by long accumulation (...)</blockquote>


(For full effect I should now chide him for his genic panadaptationism.)

Along with Lewontin and Rose, Gould mediated a huge contradiction in our culture: they allowed the C20th left to feel we were scientific, in our comfortable blank-slatism. That we had already incorporated the deep challenge of evolutionary biology - since these eminent men told us it had no human implications. 

Read Gould for fun and uplift, but take great care, for he cares about other things more than truth. (Read Midgley and Singer first if the politics scare you; they might stop you fleeing into Gould's dodgy arms.)

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36047860)">"Milkman"</a></h3>

Anna Burns (2018)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2019<br>
<br>
Unlikeable, admirable portrait of a diseased society, the disease signified by unbearable harassment of one of its young members. The book's unlikeable because it's realistic. In Burns' telling, 70s Ulster feels like ISIS in miniature, a taste of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2671118186">Maoist China</a>: the complete infection of private life by horrible politics, slander, cruelty, and doom. The disease radiates out from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot-to-kill_policy_in_Northern_Ireland">death squads</a> and <a href="https://thebrokenelbow.com/2018/10/01/how-the-ruc-special-branch-operated-during-the-troubles/">Gestapo fuckery</a> of the "traditionalists" and the delusional gangster sociopathy, the kangaroo courts - the lash for women, and <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IRA%20six%20pack">six-packs</a> for men - of the "renouncers".

Decades of fear and vengeance bring out our worst, give psychopaths a foothold:

<blockquote>To the [IRA] groupies too, it wasn't so much these men should be fighters for the cause as that they should be the particular individuals wielding substantial power and influence in the areas, They didn't have to be paramilitaries, didn't even have to be illegal, could have been anyone. It so happened though, that in the set-up of the time, in each of those totalitarian enclaves, it was the male paramilitaries who, more than anyone, ruled over the areas with final say...

He had to be leader, Number One, making her in turn Number One Attachment.
</blockquote>



The sickest part of the book is the way that gossip feeds on itself, <a href="http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/excerpts-from-a-larger-discussion-about-simulacra/">floats</a> free of reality - her ordinary stalker accuses Maybe-girlfriend of "aggravated harassment"; she's seen "with" [being harrassed by] a Big Man, so she becomes tainted/anointed with his aweing disrespectability; later, after he threatens to kill her boyfriend, the grapevine instead has it that she'd "tried to evade retribution for cheating on him with a car mechanic". A rape of social standing, of identity.

Burns gives out great lines, poetic heft, to everyone, even vicious people like Ma and Milkman.

<blockquote>Why can’t you take on board you’re not wanted, that your advances are not to be accepted, that it’s thanks but no thanks? You mean nothing to us, we don’t even think of you and another thing, you can’t just act with impunity, carrying on as if it didn’thappen, as if you didn’t start this, as if you didn’t stir things up. You’re a cat – that’s right, you heard us, a cat – a double cat! We don’t think you’re up to the level of even being a cat. But don’t you push us so far because this is aggravated harassment
</blockquote>



Maybe-girlfriend's own register is a little tiring, bright and arch and digressive (but not enough to keep the  the pall of her surroundings lifted). It might be an attempt to balance out the setting with comically out-of-place lyricism, but if so it works strangely:

<blockquote>'But understand, daughter,’ went on ma, ‘I'm not saying my rear cannot now fit in the chair because the chair's become too tight for it. It can still fit in. It’s just that now it encompasses a certain amount of extra inches or fractions of inches to which it has never acclimatised and which in the old days didn’t used to be.'
'I knew now, of course, what she was driving at, though unsure still how to respond.... My response therefore, should be comparable to her own words, should be of like tone and weight in order to acknowledge and to respect her older status, even her originality indelineating the depth of her rear condition in relation to the chair she was speaking of.
</blockquote>



The Community hates the depressed and the upbeat ("shiny"), the chaste and the promiscuous, the deviation:

<blockquote>And that was the trouble with the shiny people. Take a whole group of individuals who weren’t shiny, maybe a whole community, a whole nation, or maybe just a statelet immersed long-term on the physical and energetic planes in the dark mental energies; conditioned too, through years of personal and communal suffering, to be overladen with heaviness and grief and fear and anger – well, these people could not, not at the drop of a hat, be open to any bright shining button of a person stepping into their environment and shining upon them just like that... 

As for the environment, that too, would object, backing up the pessimism of its people, which was what happened where I lived where the whole place always seemed to be in the dark. It was as if the electric lights were turned off, always turned off, even though dusk was over so they should have been turned on yet nobody was turning them on and nobody noticed either, they weren’t on...

So shiny was bad, and 'too sad' was bad, and 'too joyous' was bad, which meant you had to go around not being anything; also not thinking, least not at top level, which was why everybody kept their private thoughts safe and sound in the recesses underneath.
</blockquote>



I quite liked the purely-functional names - "maybe-boyfriend", "third-brother-in-law", "longest friend from primary school", "Somebody McSomebody", though I see it's not a popular methodology on here. I think "Milkman" is the only proper name in it. 

She belabours a good metaphor (the sunset from the front cover): even the colour of a beautiful sunset is an ideological matter, for these locals. They've a particular cached thought - "the sky is blue" - and refuse to let a fancy intellectual (a spirited French teacher) make them notice that the sky is currently anything but blue. Blatant wilful error in the face of decisive evidence, maintained to express one's identity: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics">welcome to the species</a>.

Reviewers call it funny, which it isn't really until Chapter Seven, until Milkman is gone and the Carry On-Tarantino part can kick off. There's <a href="https://youtu.be/9BVKdy7BXBE?t=73">this</a>:

<blockquote>Before Milkman, they had shot a binman, twobusdrivers, a road sweeper, a real milkman who was our milkman, then another person whodidn’t have any blue-collar or service-industry connections – all in mistake for Milkman. Thenthey shot Milkman. Then they played down the mistaken shootings while playing up theintended shooting, as if it had been Milkman and only Milkman they had shot all along.
</blockquote>


and

<blockquote>"You’re a female. He’s a male. You’re my sister-in-law and I don’t care how many of his family got murdered, he’s a bastard and would’ve been a bastard even if they hadn’t got murdered." They hadn’t got murdered. Only four had got murdered. The other two had been a suicide and an accidental death.
</blockquote>


Very tiring but worthy overall.

<blockquote>"Have you read widely in Boethius?"
"Who? Oh, heavens no. I never even read newspapers."
"Then you must begin a reading program immediately so that you may understand the crises of our age," Ignatius said solemnly. "Begin with the late Romans, including Boethius, of course. Then you should dip rather extensively into early Medieval. You may skip the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. That is mostly dangerous propaganda. Now that I think of it, you had better skip the Romantics and the Victorians, too. For the contemporary period, you should study some selected comic books."

Funny, loving portrait of Arts grad pretension / wilful ineffectuality, and of New Orleans. (Ignatius is a dogmatic Boethian, but the pattern repeats in neo-Aristotelians, neo-Thomists, ecocriticism, technocriticism, Heideggerians...) 

Ignatius is a perfect tragicomic figure, managing to be both physically and intellectually parochial (he never leaves Norleans) and but eloquent and ridiculously overconfident. But it's about twice as long as it should be.

Odd beast: a time capsule where half the items are of purely historical interest, and half are general and extremely wise arguments that are still not acted upon today. He had planned them to be annual collections, but they didn't happen, so this looks to represent more than one year's best. 
Recent enough to tell us something about the internet, though with lots of anachronism. But it's more at the lexical level - "weblog", "Sociable media" - than the semantic.

Found (eminent media researcher) danah boyd ludicrous: she calls developers autistic, and calls people with several online identities multiple-personality disordered (a person is one person. So all their activities have to be one person!) Disappointing, typical social theory. She aggressively pushes a horrendous risky single-sign-in for all sites based on these shitty polemics and nothing else.

Contains helpful principles which will not age:, e.g. "if you can't understand the spec for a new technology, don't worry: nobody else will understand it either, and the technology won't be that important".

<blockquote>“I talked to Bertie about his marriages and divorces once,” Shenming said. “He said that there’s a saying in English that marriage is like a gilded birdcage. The birds outside want to get in, and the birds inside want to get out, he said, so divorce leads to marriage and marriage leads to divorce and there’s never any end to it.”

“There’s a saying like that in France, too,” Miss Su said. “Only there it’s about a forteresse assiégée — a fortress under siege. The people outside want to storm in, and the people inside are desperate to get out.”

Two books: one farce (A Confederacy of Dunces meets the Campus Trilogy - which would be the highest praise, if those books didn't have contradictory goals and tones), one soft Bovary tragedy. Internationalist (most characters speak another language), if only for comic effect.

The main character, Fang Hongjian ("Grand Drippy Square" or maybe "Local Big Soak"), is a pompous fraud who slowly realises that all of his fellow intellectuals are the same. Forced to adlib a speech on what he learned about the West during his long (bogus) studies there, he comes up with:

<blockquote>there are only two items from the West which have been lasting in Chinese society. One is opium, and the other is syphilis. These are what the Ming dynasty assimilated of Western civilization.</blockquote>



The Japanese invade midway through but are just a nuisance to Fang, who is much more vexed by his parents messing with his marriage.

People complain about the translation, but they've done that with three different translations, so maybe the stodginess is in the original too, and its air of cosmopolitan, Wodehousian lightness is just air.

Fun, thoughtful, especially for music nerds.

<blockquote>“Look, bollocks! Pixies seem to be an act that, while little appreciated within their own lifetime, have retrospectively come to be seen as one of the greats, and while, in that respect, they can be compared to The Velvet Underground or even Joy Division, where they differ from the latter two acts is that, in spite of all that obfuscating acclaim, they never actually produced a full LP of unskippable tracks.” – good going Sooty actually, you can be so eloquent! – [much more]

– “and don’t get me started on the Nirvana connection, which, by the way, I mean... you go ‘Yeah, they influenced Nirvana’ – who were a better band! And anyway, Kurt used to give props to all of his indie contemporaries, so I don’t see where’s the great re-evaluation of Flipper or The Melvins...

Look, it doesn’t matter, because that’s actually my point. When you’re really into music, you get into it, and you end up having these weird appreciations, like Kurt had – you might end up thinking that what to everyone else is a forgotten one-hit wonder deserves consideration with the rest of the greats. And you might look at the Pixies and decide they’re one of the greats, too, but when you come at it just having heard that they are great, then you’re not into it, and you don’t end up with a real love, just an appreciation. It’s why a fan of, you know, Mudhoney or...Pearl Jam’s going to be more passionate, because they’ve got something to prove. You haven’t got anything to prove, because you’ve never come to it that way.” – this is actually going really well. If I wrap up soon, I might actually win this one – “Look, if you’re going to sit there with your uncontroversial opinions where you just say that the same bands Q Magazine says are great, are, then you just look like a total...” – alright Sooty, go out on a high note here, and you’ll be invincible – “massive twat.” – fuck – “just a twat. Probably a twat with loads of unopened Pixies CDs on the shelf.”

There is some masturbation but it's a minor theme. Nor is the title writing off the characters as  actively unpleasant - they're at worst a little pretentious. I think it's as in onanism, narcissism, not thinking of your effect on others. Pleasing yourself. There's no explicit moral though: it neither condemns pleasing yourself nor reclaims it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_egoism">real ethics</a>. You get the reflection that sneaking away from your hookup is a bad way to ensure seeing them again.

High Fidelity is the obvious comparator, but Sooty is less dysfunctional, more optimistic, much less dependent on true love to save him. St Aubyn is the preferred comparator - of the inability to really control oneself, of moral luck and lack of luck.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6518085)">"Pro Git (Expert's Voice in Software Development)"</a></h3>

Scott Chacon (2009)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2015<br>
<br>
Neal Stephenson once hyperbolised the situation in OS choice as follows:

<blockquote>
Linux is right next door and is not a business at all. It's a bunch of RVs, yurts, tepees, and geodesic domes set up in a field and organized by consensus. The people who live there are making tanks. These are not old-fashioned, cast-iron Soviet tanks; these are more like the M1 tanks of the U.S. Army, made of space-age materials and jammed with sophisticated technology from one end to the other. But they are better than Army tanks. They've been modified in such a way that they never, ever break down, are light and maneuverable enough to use on ordinary streets, and use no more fuel than a subcompact car. These tanks are being cranked out, on the spot, at a terrific pace, and a vast number of them are lined up along the edge of the road with keys in the ignition. Anyone who wants can simply climb into one and drive it away for free. 
</blockquote>


This is overstated; Debian and Ubuntu, the chief consumer descendents, are as buggy as any other. But the very same people built Git, and it is a battle-tank. Fast, unbreakable and life-saving. Why hasn't it taken over the world, outside of tech industry? 1) most people don't need non-linear incremental backups; 2) the learning curve is bloody steep even for techies.

Entities that you need to know about to use Git without absurdity: the files, the working tree, the index, many local repositories, many remote repositories, 'remotes' (pointers to remote repositories), commits, treeishes (pointers to commits), branches, a stash

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7093673)">"Niubi!: The Real Chinese You Were Never Taught in School"</a></h3>

Eveline Chao (2009)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2014<br>
<br>
Actually I was - but only because my lăoshī was a saucy linguistics grad who warned me not to practice the tricky phoneme <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5#Proper_noun">日</a> or <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%85%A5#Chinese">入</a> on the street, or ever to shout “<a href="http://www.chinese-tools.com/forum/read.html?q=19%2C69719">3-8</a>!”. 

Anyway this is funny and valuable for understanding the place’s (otherwise inaccessible) working-class or web or queer registers – and for generally not seeming like a prig. 

So: language is fossilised sociology; Chao excavates what would take us decades. She begins with slurs of all sorts, but doesn’t list any homophobia – claiming it isn’t a well-rooted hatred there (…). There’s loads and loads of ableism, though. Gets more serious as it goes, with whole chapters on gay culture and web ‘activism’ (恶搞 is ‘evildoings’, lulz). This turns up details like the infallibly hilarious “potato queen”. I also loved her decoding the ancient innuendoes: 云雨 (clouds and rain), 鱼水之欢 (the fish and the water, happy together), 余桃 (sharing peaches), or “playing the bamboo flute” or “bamboo harmonica”. 

(BTW, the title term is 牛屄 – ‘Cow-cunt’ – and means “Awesome!”. It is generally not included in mainstream Hanzi keyboard programs.)

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16065621)">"Do You Believe in Magic?: The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine"</a></h3>

Paul A. Offit (2013)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Oct 2013<br>
<br>
Heinous illusions leech £200bn off the world’s vulnerables, annually. The problems of CAM have been covered with more originality and verve by Goldacre / Singh &amp; Ernst, but Offit covers its history, as well as some newer meta-analyses (2005: <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_releases/2004/11_10_04.html">n=136,000</a> finds increased mortality from dosing vitamin E. 2008: Cochrane (n=<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/26/medicalresearch.health">230,000</a>) concludes multivits correlate weakly with increase in cancer and heart disease risk, <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/news/features/2011/UR_CONTENT_363761.html">further confirmed</a> in 2011). 

But you can’t hear these ideas too often: there’s no such thing as conventional or alternative medicine (only stuff that works and stuff that doesn’t); everything is chemicals; origin is irrelevant to chemistry; too much of a good thing is lethal; the natural is not always or generally good. 

Offit is too quick to jump from the conclusive weak-magnitude evidence against multivitamins (particularly overdosing vitamins A, C, and E) to his attack on all supplementation. For instance: some two-thirds of the world is deficient in vitamin D; few people get enough magnesium through their food; and it’s uncontroversial that vegans should supplement B12. But we’re not really in conflict, because he’d change his mind if he looked at the evidence, and we each accept that (publically-funded) science will out the truth.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/956301)">"The Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in Politics"</a></h3>

Mark Lilla (2001)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2011<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Jaspers: “How can such an uncultivated man like Adolf Hitler govern Germany?”<br>
Heidegger: “Culture doesn’t matter. Just look at his marvelous hands.”
</blockquote>


Denunciation of the terrible politics of some academic darlings (Heidegger, Foucault, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin">Benjamin</a>, Carl Schmitt). The common theme is that their philosophies so radically distorted their perception, that their interventions in politics were inevitably harmful.

Lilla tries to make the edginess and procrustean attitudes of these men reflect badly on all philosophy, or philosophers in civil society. This doesn't work - think of Smith's influence, or Mill's, or Russell's, or Bentham's - though it might be true of a certain kind of Continental, the kind incentivised to say novel things regardless of their truth or consequences, I don't know.

Possibly I reacted so strongly because this was the first dissent against these great nasty obscurantists I'd seen; other writing by Lilla hasn't impressed me, and though the targets of this book are bipartisan, his agenda is too plain.

Good old Jaspers comes out very well from all this, anyway, an Obi-wan figure:

<blockquote>I beseech you! if ever we shared philosophical impulses, take responsibility for your gifts! Place it in the service of reason, or of the reality of human worth & possibilities, instead of in the service of magic!

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18736925)">"Capital in the Twenty First Century"</a></h3>

Thomas Piketty (2014)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2014<br>
<br>
Was very impressed by this first time round, but the subsequent scholarly pushback convinces me it's too flawed to endorse without including this list of corrections:

* <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2543012">Magness</a>: Piketty's data don't account for bias in income tax reporting. This undermines his claim that inequality is now as bad as it was in the early 1900s: when tax codes change dramatically, as they did through the pre-war period and in 1986, the data become unrepresentative (without adjustment). After adjustment, it looks like inequality fell much less in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion">postwar boom</a> and has risen much less, post-80s.
* <a href="http://mattrognlie.com/piketty_diminishing_returns.pdf">Rognlie</a> and <a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/spowpecon/info_3ahdl_3a2441_2f30nstiku669glbr66l6n7mc2oq.htm">Bonnet et al</a>: Piketty calculated the increase in capital share wrong, it's a lot lower; price appreciation (benefiting the rich) is not general, instead driven by housing. This mostly benefits single-home-owners, who use their capital by living in it, and so aren't 'rentiers'; thus Piketty is mostly wrong about the rise of rentier capitalism. Also, housing shortages are often political rather than fundamental, which again undermines the big anti-capital policy implication. 
* <a href="http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/teaching/FurmanOrszag15.pdf">Furman and Orszag</a>: Piketty's explanation for extreme income disparities (: large increases in corporate-executive bargaining power) isn't right; instead only a small group of monopolistic tech firms ("superstars") display this.  
* <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/files/11348">Acemoglu and Robinson</a>: The evidence is mostly strongly against his three fundamental laws of capitalism. Most importantly, the elasticity of substitution of capital for labour is less than one; therefore, Piketty's main mechanism for explaining inequality cannot be true.
* <a href="http://www.deirdremccloskey.org/docs/pdf/PikettyReviewEssay.pdf">McCloskey</a>: lots of errors.

Piketty's core claims:<blockquote>
1. the capital share of national income has risen (at the expense of labour share).
2. r > g; wealth generally grows faster than economic output.
3. whenever r > g, inequality will rise because capital gets concentrated in fewer hands. 
3b. r (the return to capital) won't change much in response to a decline in growth rate, because the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is high.
4. The capital-output ratio will be worse in the future.
5. Therefore large wealth tax now, or both capitalism and democracy will die. 
</blockquote>


The above research finds that the first is true in some places (in the UK, the US and Canada?), but each of the middle three is questionable. (4) could happen but we're not given much reason to think it inevitable. Summary: Piketty's data collection and descriptive work is mostly good, his analysis and modelling is flawed enough to undo his policy recommendations (5).

-----

The resentful econ undergrad in me thrilled to see Piketty saying this:

<blockquote>To put it bluntly, the discipline of economics has yet to get over its childish passion for mathematics and for purely theoretical and often highly ideological speculation, at the expense of historical research and collaboration with the other social sciences. Economists are all too often preoccupied with petty mathematical problems of interest only to themselves. This obsession with mathematics is an easy way of acquiring the appearance of scientificity without having to answer the far more complex questions posed by the world we live in. There is one great advantage of being an academic economist in France: here, economists are not highly respected in the academic and intellectual world or by political and financial elites. Hence they must set aside their contempt for other disciplines and their absurd claim to greater scientific legitimacy, despite the fact that they know almost nothing about anything.</blockquote>

 

 He's keen to emphasise his ideological hygiene, that he's a real-deal empiricist. Weighed down by overstatement of its own achievement (“the fundamental laws of capitalism”). 

With a few more diagrams and boxed definitions, this would make an excellent intro macro textbook, gentle and empirically obsessive as it is. Lot of redundancy - whoa-there steady-now summary paragraphs every few pages - but I suppose that's what you need to do if you aim to be understood by policymakers.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222146)">"Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture"</a></h3>

David Kushner (2004)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2019<br>
<br>
Kinda amateurish prose, everything "classic" and "legendary" in the same sentence.

It's saved by the singular, remarkable character Carmack. Neuroatypical, ascetic, principled, focussed to the point of dissociation. He slept on the floor for months, despite being rich, because he didn't see the need for comfort. An excellent example of what someone profoundly creative can do, if they also love work. (: All the glories of the species.)

Romero is less interesting, because he is a fairly ordinary tech startup founder (with a sicker sense of humour and less self-suppression), mendacious and loud. "To the outside world, Romero was id."He may have invented gaming smack talk, by screaming at people in LAN tournaments.  If you've never been on Xbox Live, you probably haven't had a 9 year-old child scream that you're a faggot and a noob. The child is channeling Romero.

I concede that there would have been no Doom Moment without Romero's hyping it - that together these two men form one functioning human being.

Kushner occasionally adds value, e.g. when he notes that id were to gaming what technical metal was to music: the marriage of virtuosity with extreme content, "high technology and gruesome gameplay". To see how important skill is in selling a dark aesthetic, compare the Learjet-level success of fancy metal with the parochial subsistence of hardcore punk. 

He also sees an entire type very clearly: the alpha nerd, with all his lofty contempt, Ferraris, workaholism, disloyalty, pranks, energy. This is much more common in life than in media.

Repetitive though; skim.

It is the basic useful activity of scientists and scholars, and PhD students should be pleased to make a contribution to it. You can leave the paradigm shifts for after your PhD...
</blockquote>


Liked it - it has a quiet rigour and schoolmistressy focus I wasn't expecting - but my god you have to skim. Many sentences could lose two-thirds of the words without losing any meaning; probably no-one exists for whom every chapter is relevant. But they make skimming easy by listing recommended actions in a box at the start of each chapter.

There's a thoughtful chapter on psychological mechanisms to watch out for. 
( e.g. Enthusiasm -> overambition -> failure -> frustration -> no energy; 
Specialisation -> isolation -> no stimulation -> no energy; 
Learning -> independence -> shorter cycles -> faster learning -> fuzzies and progress.
Boredom -> Boredom -> Boredom. ) 
The many quotations from current PhD students are nice, showing the range of characters and concomitant problems you face, allowing you to tailor the advice a bit.

They confess that any general book on the matter is necessarily incomplete, since each field has its own defining skills, styles, and norms, often unwritten or badly written.

Call the reigning institutionalised, credentialist way of allocating epistemic value schoolism. This book is a particularly blithe example

<blockquote>It is only by understanding the need for precision and having the ability to apply yourself in a disciplined way that you will eventually get to the point where you have the right to follow up interesting leads and explore a series of ideas that arise out of the work in hand. We suggest that, for the moment, this should be after your doctorate.
</blockquote>



(To be fair they also instruct you to think for yourself, to manage your supervisor, etc.)

The "non-traditional students" chapter is interesting, if only for the separate sections for male and female students which have almost the same advice. ("1. Join or establish a [gender]’ peer support group. 2. Discuss with your supervisors any problems in the male/female aspect of the student–supervisor relationship...") Neat but kind of disingenuous.

Questions and answers I (loosely) got from this:

* What needs to be done? -> It's your first job to find out 
* What do I need to know to do it? -> field-specific; watch and learn.
* What are the standards? -> Read theses. List the craft practices of a good researcher.
* Who should my advisor be? -> Kind, active researcher, interested in your thing, low flight risk
* What counts as original enough? -> Read theses to find out, take the delta
* What counts as large enough? -> "an increment"
* How do I not get scooped? -> Don't worry about it. The important thing is to notice you have been.
* How do I not freeze up on seeing the fractal connectedness of all things? -> notice it, make a note, then return to your breath.
* What about my mental health? -> Exercise, take breaks and talk to fellow experts
* How do I not feel isolated? -> communicate more and better. Stay excited, people like it.
* What if I fuck up? -> Practice and get feedback! use no technique for the first time in your thesis. Do throwaways, etudes.
* Why should they listen to you? -> because you've nailed everything down and added a cherry

Mind candy. Blasted through it in two sittings.

Morgan makes cyberpunk look subtle. But it's cool stuff and I've read everything he's written, even though half of it reuses the same kind of super-protagonist, the same kind of dialogue, the same kind of gimmick weapons, the same kind of grimdark Chomskyan geopolitics (arespolitics).

India has always depressed me. I can't bear the universal dirt and squalor and the impression, false I am sure, that everyone is doing no work except living off his neighbour. And I am desolated by the outward manifestations of the two great Indian religions.

Well, I have, but it is only a brief and rather dull exhortation to our young to 'Go East, young man!' See the Pacific Ocean and die! </blockquote>

What is so pleasant is that, combined with the delicious, always new sights and smells of 'abroad', there is a sense of achievement, of a task completed, when each target is reached without accident, on time and with the car still running sweetly. There is the illusion that one has done a hard and meritorious day's work (few women understand this—perhaps, poor beasts, because they have been only passengers).

Brad Stone (2013)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Apr 2019<br>
<br>
Less critical than I was expecting, still good. The trouble with evaluating leaders (this goes for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_investigator">modern scientists</a> as much as corporate founders) is that they are able to take so much credit for the work of those they hire / train. Even so, Bezos had a lot of ideas - we know this because some failures are attributed to him, putting an upper bound at least on the file-drawer problem of Amazon's creativity. (Stone seems pretty good at tracking down the real inventors. And he literally dug through Bezos' garbage in search of details.) And he is a hyperactive micromanager, pulling conference call screens off the walls, ramming through his pet projects over any amount of opposition:

<blockquote>Almost alone, Bezos believed fervently in Prime, closely tracking sign-ups each day and intervening every timr the retail group dropped its promotions from the home page.
</blockquote>



The management style is/was macho, with an uneasy mix of flat objectivity (if you show the maths of your idea works, you are likely to get serious consideration) and imperial whim (like making everyone write meeting notes in full prose - which is based on no science in particular).

<blockquote>Bezos treats workers like expendable resources without taking into account their contributions to the company. That in turn allows him to coldly allocate capital and manpower and make hyperrational business decisions where another executive might let personal relationships intrude. But they also acknowledge that Bezos is primarily consumed with improving the company's performance and customer service...
</blockquote>



Some of Stone's anecdotes about this or that mid-level exec are neither funny nor illustrative, and make this feel like a reference text. I suppose there should be one.

With them so dominant now, it's easy to forget the stock crashing to $10, or Amazon being seriously threatened by a single Lehman analyst, or all the many failures like Auctions or zShops or A9.com. And that they really were another garage operation that took over the world.

Stone does push back a bit - the "two-pizza team" idea gets uncritically celebrated in business, but Stone says that the actual teams hate it. I'm fascinated by Bezos making each team come up with their own <a href="http://www.andreweifler.com/fitness-functions/">objective function</a> - but apparently this is also hated, on "digging our own grave" grounds. (Isn't any quantified performance metric hated?)

Then there's the context switch that makes the billions seem small: since he was a child, Bezos seems to honestly see himself as shepherding humanity into space, with Amazon a means to that end.

Not enough coverage of just how weird Amazon is, in terms of shareholder quiescence, the astonishing amount of cheap capital it hoovers up, its terrible reputation among 90s and 00s analyst as a "nonprofit scam". It was <a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/profit_margin">almost never profitable</a> for 20 straight years, but people kept throwing money into the bubble... which has stopped being a bubble (because of AWS, not really retail). The tiny tax burden that people decry should start growing, and antitrust attention too.

No attention to what we should expect of Amazon's effect on literature and ideas, given the mass die-off of local bookshops and the weakening of gatekeeper publishers. (I don't know what the effect is either, but if I wrote a book about them I hope I would have a go.)

The first third is: Talking About Data Science. But that's good; two careful, socially conscious techies talking is nice, and you would never get the dozens of handy heuristics in this from a usual STEM textbook. Crunchier than it looks - half the value is in the dull-looking, unannotated code samples at the end of each chapter, and isn't spelled out. Pedagogy! 

It is galling, then, that the data for chapters 6 and 8 has already link-rotted away. And half of the cool startups who came to talk to the class are dead and forgotten already. 

Only worth it if you can find the data.

Engrossing optimistic catalogue of the counter-intuitions that urban economics provides us: “poverty can mean a city’s doing well, since the poor wouldn’t stay, otherwise”, “cities are greener and more democratic (smaller houses, less travel, scale utilities)”, “zoning laws ensure prices are too high, apartments too small, congestion, sprawl, slums and corruption”, “people are less unhappy and less suicidal in cities”. 

Glaeser’s aims are larger than simple Gladwellian gee-whizzing: he’s out to get a prevailing anti-city mood (e.g. Blake, Rousseau, Thoreau, hippies). Explains why art is urban, why we didn’t have good ideas before settlements, the origins of the restaurant (in a crap Parisian health-food place), the skyscraper, and the global bank Chase Manhattan (in a scam defrauding money meant for NY’s first public water supply). Valuing the devalued, staying within evidential warrant, and honest about the achievements of public agencies.

(That looks glib, but in context - a Keynesian socialist critique - it's not.

<blockquote> Forces of digestion and metabolism are at work within me that are utterly beyond my perception or control. Most of my internal organs may as well not exist for all I know of them directly, and yet I can be reasonably certain that I have them, arranged much as any medical textbook would suggest. The taste of the coffee, my satisfaction at its flavor, the feeling of the warm cup in my hand—while these are immediate facts with which I am acquainted, they reach back into a dark wilderness of facts that I will never come to know.

... Where am I, that I have such a poor view of things? And what sort of thing am I that both my outside and my inside are so obscure? ...Am I inside my skull? Let’s say yes for the moment, because we are quickly running out of places to look for me. Where inside my skull might I be? And if I’m up there in my head, how is the rest of me me?
</blockquote>

 
Surprisingly humble and sincere. Some readers feel tricked - feel that Harris is smuggling in science under soft, false pretences. This isn't fair; he has done this stuff for decades, visited lamas in Tibet, put in the work. It's implausible that he would do so much insincerely; whatever his other failings, he is actually trying to bridge the two kinds of seekers.* (That said, this book design is a masterpiece of camouflage. Look at the soft colours, the sunny logo, the sans-serif purity, the unthreatening subtitle. Compare his other books!)

However: consider all the things people mean by "spirituality":
1. subjective knowledge of ultimate / immaterial reality
1b. gaining supernatural abilities as a result
2. one's deep moral or existential values
3. personal growth
4. feeling of awe-inspiring beauty
5. introspection; close contact with one's own "inner dimension"
6. "the ability to step a little back from your emotions and thoughts, observe them as they are without getting swept up in them, and then evaluating them critically"
7. sense of love towards (all) others
8. the quest to see the ego and the self as illusory

With so much popular support - with so much baggage - it's not possible to throw out the word or concept; instead we have to try and reform it. This is Harris' mission - though in fact he focusses almost exclusively on (5) -> (8), the standard Buddhist therapy of not being hurt by distraction, bad luck, frustrated desires. 

He rejects (1) straightforwardly, in favour of psychologising the whole practice. Paraphrased: 'Instead of making you experience Reality, meditation lets you experience your mind; instead of strengthening your insubstantial soul, you're strengthening your mind.' This is a healthy kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_reconstruction">reconstruction</a> in my view, but it certainly leads him to make controversial claims like "The deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self". Metaphysically profligate readers will have no fun here. (But they knew that already.)

How can a scientist (or at least a pro-science talking head) boost a practice with the aim of rejecting thought? The trick is to distinguish thinking / experiencing (which are after all the locus of all value, and of decisions and creativity) from identifying with the stream of your thoughts, from being carried away, from being endlessly distracted. 

---

Does this stuff work? It <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818837">probably does</a> for stress reduction - at least like taking a nap does, or a valium, or sitting still and breathing deeply for a bit. And on the other end, it is definitely not the source of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_energy">supernatural brain-juice-drinking power</a>. So the truth is somewhere between these two limits, and we drift, deciding whether to spend time on it.

I'm an unpromising practitioner. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_proliferation">this</a> is kind of my jam. It's not the indescribability that bothers me - after all, any knowledge-how is indescribable (or rather describable only with <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/205757/neural-network-how-are-number-of-parameters-calculated">millions of parameters</a>). You can accept e.g. Hume or Parfit's reasoning - you can have the propositional knowledge, can <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/01/knowing-that-versus-knowing-how/">know that</a> "there is no self beyond my bundle of experiences". Meditation is supposed to be the know-how of nonessentialism, the skill of actually paying attention to the implications of this System-2 judgment.

But being 'nonconceptual' means no language, no premises, no reason, no jokes, no connection, no comparison, using none of my strengths, leaving none of my spoor. This is a great loss to me.

I don't know that I do suffer as a result of identifying with my thoughts; I don't think that dissatisfaction lurks in every sensation I ever experience or also my whole life in retrospect. But the old claim, similar to Marxist or feminist 'false consciousness', is that I am too owned to realise I'm being owned:

<blockquote>
"beginning meditators... report after days or weeks of intensive practice that their attention is carried away by thought every few seconds. This is actually progress. It takes a certain degree of concentration to even notice how distracted you are."
</blockquote>



Freedom from desire sounds much like death to me, for all that Harris and others argue that it can somehow coexist with passion against the suffering of others, with striving to be a better person, with chipping in to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=I+hereby+renounce+the+right+to+complacency%2C+and+vow+lifelong+to+take+only+what+minimum+of+leisure+is+necessary+to+my+productivity%2C+viewing+health%2C+happiness%2C+rest%2C+and+play+as+means%2C+not+ends%2C+and+that%2C+while+Utopia+provides+my+needs%2C+I+will+commit+the+full+produce+of+my+labors+to+our+collective+effort+to+redirect+the+path+of+human+life+away+from+death+and+towards+the+stars.&oq=I+hereby+renounce+the+right+to+complacency%2C+and+vow+lifelong+to+take+only+what+minimum+of+leisure+is+necessary+to+my+productivity%2C+viewing+health%2C+happiness%2C+rest%2C+and+play+as+means%2C+not+ends%2C+and+that%2C+while+Utopia+provides+my+needs%2C+I+will+commit+the+full+produce+of+my+labors+to+our+collective+effort+to+redirect+the+path+of+human+life+away+from+death+and+towards+the+stars">Great Project</a> of discovery, compassion, optimisation. Luckily the two projects - really feeling that you are not your thoughts, not a homunculus behind your eyes having them; vs not wanting things because wanting leads to disappointment - seem to be separable.

A consolation: there's a sense in which meditation, introspection and phenomenology are highly, maximally empirical - they involve very close attention and analysis of the raw data. It just happens that the raw data (the sense-data) are irreplicable, private, closed, and so not directly a matter for science. Empiricism before science, consciousness without self. And I like this. 

Mindfulness is billed as not just cool and true but useful -

<blockquote>No doubt many distinct mechanisms are involved - the regulation of attention and behaviour, increased body awareness, inhibition of negative emotions, reframing of experience, changes in your view of the 'self', and so forth - and each of these will have their own neurophysiological basis."
</blockquote>


Well, I do love self-regulation!

The following argument isn't explicitly stated by Harris, but I find it helpful as an existence-proof for the usefulness of nonessentialism:
1. We are happy and perform well when we're in 'flow' states.
2. Flow states involve "losing" yourself in a task, in a concrete, unhesitating sequence of perceptions and actions.
3. Therefore losing yourself can be good and helpful.

Also

1. We do not directly apprehend the external world; we know it through sense-data plus massive computational modelling tricks in the brain.
2. We know that the brain computes the wrong thing sometimes. (Cognitive biases, optical illusions, top-down processing, hallucinations.)
3. So, if such a thing is possible, it could be helpful to attend to sense-data more closely, to rule out automatic-brain errors.

While I don't have a very clear philosophy of mind, I know I'm not a direct realist or substance dualist or identity essentialist, so I've no simple philosophical objections to breaking down the Self, either. Allons-y.

---

Even if I accept that mindfulness is a source of value, there's presumably still a tradeoff against clearer, quicker, more public sources: doing science or kindnesses or pleasures. <a href="https://www.uk.dhamma.org/courses/10-day-courses/">10 days spent in myself</a> is 10 days not learning, not exercising, not enjoying, not helping, not meeting, in solitary. (And even on the contemplative axis it competes with Stoicism, with yoga, with writing, with psychedelics.)


How much work will it be? Some contemplatives freely admit that the cost is very high: some contemplatives are not just salesmen. I met someone who claimed to be capital-e-enlightened. (He was otherwise articulate and modest.) He said it took 6 years' work, at many hours a week. I asked him if he could say how valuable it is in other terms - 'What else has been as good?' He said: a decade of intense psychotherapy, or two philosophy degrees. (<a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.22.0.than.html">One ancient text</a> teases us by setting 'seven years' as the required period, but in true troll-Buddhist style it then slowly walks back this helpful definite statement.)

---

On that note: I was looking forward to writing a gotcha paradox here, but Harris (and thousands of years of arhats and yogis) pre-empted me:

<blockquote>
...the deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self -[but] to seek such freedom, as though it were a future state to be attained through effort, is to reinforce the chains of one's apparent bondage in each moment.

One [solution] is to simply ignore the paradox and adopt various techniques of meditation in the hope that a breakthrough will occur. Some people appear to succeed at this, but many fail... Goal-oriented modes of practice have the virtue of being easily taught, because a person can begin them without having had any fundamental insight...

...The other traditional response is... to concede that all efforts are doomed, because the urge to attain self-transcedence or any other mystical experience is a symptom of the very disease we want to cure. There is nothing to do but give up the search.
</blockquote>



I'm not actually worried by this, because I suspect the full-Buddhist anti-striving thing is unnecessary and... undesirable.

---


Why should an evolved creature have the power to inspect its own sense-data? If we are constantly distracting ourselves with reified thoughts, what evolutionary role did this play? At the top of this review is Harris' droll diss about people deluding themselves into thinking they are meditating - but how can we know that we, or anyone, is not deluded? (Brain scans of inhibited medial PFCs are interesting but merely suggestive.)

---

Most of the above isn't directly from Harris, I'm riffing off <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha">better</a> <a href="https://flightfromperfection.com/mindfulness-striving.html">rationalist</a> reconstructions of this ancient one-weird-trick. (I actually don't know if this is any good, cos I don't know the area. Seems fine.)


* Much of their anger is about his chapter warning of the history of abuse by gurus and yogis and so on. But like it or not this is a public service.

A tasting platter of C20th literature (one book synopsised per year of the century), as well as very successful pastiche, as well as highbrow larfs, and also, occasionally, a tiny philosophical critique of revered writers. It is of course easy to make anything ridiculous if you compress it enough, but Crace is not cheap about it. He reserves most of his scorn for the obscene sensationalists (Ballard, Burroughs, Joyce, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2010/jan/08/unbearable-lightness-being-milan-kundera">Kundera</a>). Here is the main joke Crace makes in at least half of all of them, fourth-wall shamelessness:

<blockquote>“Why do you do Junk, Bill?”
“Because once I´ve shovelled enough garbage into my body” I replied, “I’ll get away with shovelling any old garbage into print.  Take it from me, some suckers will one day call Naked Lunch a masterpiece”.

I read books about books because I'm a prig: my ignorance of these things makes me anxious. As a result of reading Crace, I can tell I won't read about fifty of the hundred. So, big gains, even if the larfs wear thin halfway through.

James Gleick (1988)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2017<br>
<br>
Romantic, dramatic, constructive pop science: the physics, meteorology and maths in this was famed but not well-explained before this came out. The theme of the very different results presented here is unprecedented successes in recognising and explaining nonlinear systems. Very human: every researcher is profiled sensitively, generally as an outsider challenging the stuffy, desk-bound precepts of 'linear science'. Since ornery, heroic Mandelbrot is included here, you get an exciting ride even if you don't like maths or science or the world or the underlying generative process of all instances of beauty. 

"Chaos" is a bad name for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Theory">field</a>: it implies randomness, indeterminism, intractability. Better to question why "order" can only refer to equilibrium or periodic patterns - why it is we think of order as boring. "Deterministic disorder" is more honest - and better yet is Lao-Bin's "order without periodicity".

Also, the diagrams are poor by contemporary standards: I had to stare at them for a while before grokking the concept.

Borne on what felt like an epochal wave, Gleick overreaches. He calls Smale and Mandelbrot "the end of the reductionist program in science". How is seeking and finding a precise (nonlinear) equation - which is the case in the work of all these men - for a system holist!? 

I don't actually know if the maths in here has changed everything: maybe it has, and they suffer from the Seinfeld effect for dynamical systems, seeming obvious after the fact. But I do know that the Santa Fe strain of work is more of a tolerated eccentric uncle than a science-upending behemoth.

I am prejudiced against Rousseau, him with his straightforwardly false anthropology, melodramatic politics, and preposterous egotism. His three big legacies are even easier to disparage – ‘Revolution as salvation’, ‘Feelings as truer than thoughts’, and the ‘Noble savage’ idea. 

This much arrayed against him, it’s miraculous that Confessions (‘the first modern autobiography’) is as clear and wise as it is – a deeply honest story by a deeply deluded man. (Just one instance of courage: to talk about being a sexual sub, as a man, in eC18th Europe!) 

Still he is a stroppy Forrest Gump – blundering into great events, loudly blaming them for the collision – but he is also big enough to test the great iconoclasts of his time. (Strong parallels with DH Lawrence, another supremely wilful, influential, and ridiculous soul.) Skim heavily.

Morgan has a niche: stylish, sorta politically-literate hi-octane plotfests. Altered Carbon was noir; this one’s war reportage. Kovacs - his broke-down hard-boiled super-soldier - is good, able to carry off the witty sociopathy of the action hero involuntarily – tropes are brutally programmed into him.

‘Quell’, Morgan’s Marx-figure, lurks larger here. There’s a bucket of great tech ideas, but they’re never the focus; the people scrambling in the wake of their machines are still recognisably human.

Really enjoyed this, and the core idea (being social is not a necessary condition of flourishing for some people) is important and still insufficiently appreciated. The method is not scientific (but this is only a problem because it uses the pseudoscientific register of psychoanalysis).

I find it hard to place Storr - almost all of his work was hagiographies of Freud and Jung, but he seems to have reviewed Richard Webster's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1540503.Why_Freud_Was_Wrong">classic hatchet job</a> well, and Jeffrey Masson's famous hatchet job poorly, so I dunno.

Iris Murdoch (2011)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2014<br>
<br>
Was pleased to find her young and conceited – letters laced with ‘mon dieu!’s and ‘passim’s and ‘ye gods!’es. 

To my shame, these people are all always learning five languages at once, wittily discussing the exigencies of Turkish declaratives. 

Interesting how comfortable Conradi is to contradict her – apparently she excised quite a lot from her archive, mostly on sex. Some fuckups despite his breadth (: Thompson’s last letter is dated ’43 here!) and one piece of gratuitous dramaturgy: he includes only one reply from David Hicks, making him seem sadistic rather than grudging and aloof. Her generosity / terrible co-dependence in the face of Hicks’ brutal breakup is too moving. 

Note: in this period, Murdoch copied <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Qm6OUoEtYkAC&pg=PA88&dq=iris+murdoch+assistant+principal&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL45WYuufcAhWLCcAKHX3BDb0Q6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q=%22treasury%20documents%22&f=false">many Treasury documents</a> and passed them to the Soviets. How much harm this did is arguable, but it doesn't speak well of her political sense.

Francis Wheen (1999)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2014<br>
<br>
Portrait of Karl Jeremiah Wooster Cosby Marx. Wheen’s an ideal biographer: fearless, careful, sympathetic on balance. (So, ideal for the readers rather than the subject.) 

Most of his shortish book is debunking slanders; the rest is in cementing others. Was Marx a bully? No: bullies take weak targets. A dogmatist? No; he spent twenty years researching one-quarter of his big book, and admired his bourgeois forebears Ricardo and Feuerbach. Was he a Whig ‘historian’? Sort of. Petty? Oh yes indeed. A hypocritical idealist? Tried not to be. Anti-semite? Yes, or, used the same language. Russophobe? Definitely somewhat. A bourgeois patriarch? Very much so. A heartless philanderer? Once. A show-off? Yup. 

I came up with an epitaph for him – “KM. Excellent journalist, journeyman economist, awful leader.” but I am not learned enough to assert it yet. Wheen is in a rush (Hegel’s system gets five lines) but he writes well, seems to have read everything in the vicinity.

Carol Ann Duffy (2004)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2014<br>
<br>
I’d thought of her as sort of obvious – all first-order, meaning near the surface, all on worthy themes like childhood perversity and elderly loss. But her best (“Auden’s Alphabet”, “Shooting Stars”) see her wielding that obviousness well and having fun with drudgery. More historical pieces than I expected, too. Impression: ‘dissolving into childhood’, life as school forever, if school is undemonstrative alienation and uninteresting torment. 

The epic autobiographical “<a href="https://genius.com/Carol-ann-duffy-the-laughter-of-stafford-girls-high-lyrics">Laughter of Stafford Girls’ School</a>” is good; the key to it is that after the anti-authoritarian lark, the poem follows home the prim teachers who failed to control the ruckus.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18104725)">"The Almost Nearly Perfect People: Behind the Myth of the Scandinavian Utopia"</a></h3>

Michael Booth (2014)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2014<br>
<br>
Fault-finding things received opinion finds no fault with?: good. Booth says the weather, the expense, the pressurised homogeneity of ethnicity and manner leading to marginalisation, the hypocrisy (e.g. Statoil’s tar sands) and the diet are the subtractions. But actually he's a massive fan of the countries.

The bit on their peerless state education (for decades, Finnish kids have scored the highest on tests with the lowest inequality – but note the kids’ own satisfaction with the system is the lowest on record) bases the whole Scandinavian Miracle on their school systems: “It is no coincidence that the region that is consistently judged to have the highest levels of wellbeing, also has the greatest equality of educational opportunity… To achieve authentic, sustained happiness, above all else you need power over your own life…” 

How to recreate this? He concludes that it’s a difficult-to-copy feedback loop from 1) actually respecting teachers and funding everyone’s Master’s, so 2) attracting excellent people, who 3) teach excellently and thus 1) earn the respect of their charges and society... Booth can be a bit glib (“Is it still racist if they’re rich?”), and is obsessed with tax to the point where he has to ask five different professors how on earth people don’t simply die from 50% income tax. But he gets into the cracks: “please don’t [form a separate Nordic Union]. Truly the rest of us would not stand a chance.”

Barbara Ehrenreich (2009)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2014<br>
<br>
Sharp! Blames the tendency in its many forms – the New Age mystic sort, the New Age pseudoscience sort, the self-help, motivational, pink ribbon, megachurch, and respectable positive psychology forms – for suffering and tastelessness (...including the whole 2008 financial crisis...). 

Sardonic muscle:<blockquote> 
I felt at that moment, and for the first time in this friendly crowd, absolutely alone. If science is something you can accept or reject on the basis of personal taste, then what kind of reality did she and I share?… To base a belief or worldview on science is to is to reach out to the nonbelievers and the uninitiated, to say that they too can come to the same conclusions if they make the same systematic observations and inferences. The alternative is to base one’s worldview on revelation or mystical insight, and these things cannot be reliably shared with others. So there’s something deeply sociable about science; it rests entirely on observations that can be shared with and repeated by others… It is a glorious universe the positive thinkers have come up with, a vast, shimmering aurora borealis… It’s just a god-awful lonely place.</blockquote>



Was disturbed by her personal impressions of the legit psychologists (e.g. Seligman’s profiteering and evasiveness, the blitheness of it to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1601785">WEIRDness</a> and other biases).

<br>
Insofar as anything is uncontroversial in politics – the most mired of intellectual backwaters – this sticks to uncontroversial blunders. So we only get the internally incoherent or screwy policies like Suez; poll tax; ERM <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm">Black Wednesday</a>. (The book’s larger point is that there are more and more of these to come, because of the shape of Westminster’s gears.) 

They've a compressed, formal style – hiding their anger. So ministerial ignorance and snobbishness gets called "cultural disconnect". 

First chapter is a list of state successes (green belts, social housing boom and sale, Clean Air, seat belts, vaccinations, minimum wage, smoking ban, swine flu prep) included as a counter-libertarian tonic before launching into the peaky blunders. (This actually made my chest swell with hope or pride.)

Gerd Gigerenzer (2008)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2014<br>
<br>
Yet another volley in the ‘<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/js2/the_rationality_wars/">rationality wars</a>’. GG sets himself against the heuristics and biases folk (though note he is also not of the fatuous constructionist camp which says, roughly: ‘it’s impossible for everyone to be irrational, because reason is only social, so we are the measure of it’) by minimising the apparent irrationality uncovered by the cognitive sciences in the last little while. Key claims: 
<ol>
<li>Heuristics are not just faster or more tractable, but better than Bayesian formalism.</li>
<li>People are not flawed Bayesians but natural frequentists.</li>
</ol>

But though his work on presenting natural frequencies is super-important, and his points about actual decisions always being 'ecological' (rather than a mathematical problem) I suspect he's (<a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/Csci6402/Papers/kahneman-tversky.pdf">still</a>) 1) attacking a straw version of Kahneman-Gilovich-Slovic-Stanovich: no-one is saying that perfect, everyday Bayesian algorithmics is attainable by humans; nor are the misconceptions in table 1.1 (<a href="http://www.thedivineconspiracy.org/Z5274K.pdf">p.9</a>) ever stated as strongly as this. 

Also 2) GG's evidence on e.g. the framing of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy">conjunction fallacy</a> doesn't replicate. But anyway this is well-argued, well-written, scientific in the highest sense, and wrong? Read <a href="http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ArchiveFolder/Research%20Group/Publications/Wars/wars.html">this</a> instead. 

Not as deep as I expected, but I admire his empirical work.

Clear, historical, philosophical stuff, and since he suffers from a filthy case himself he can wield authority properly for once. The chapters on the cultural variation in the expression of the illness (e.g. as a result of even more intense disdain for mental illness, Asians tend to report its symptoms as physical ailments rather than mental malaise) is startling to hear coming from such a conservative scientist, and all the more persuasive as a result.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2069)">"Consciousness Explained"</a></h3>

Daniel C. Dennett (1991)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2013<br>
<br>
Damn: impressed. The title’s supreme arrogance is misleading: his prose is clear, stylish and flowing, he's expert in the relevant experiments, and he’s much less hectoring in book form – he admits his theory’s counter-intuitive and hostile appearance, he flags alternate positions and possibilities, and it’s hard to doubt him when he says he’d change his mind if the science pointed away from his detailed eliminativism. 

I am very resistant to eliminative materialism – in fact I’ve never been able to take it seriously - so that he manages to patch over my failure of imagination is a mark of the book’s power. 

You begin to wonder – for instance when he talks about his work on children with multiple personalities disorder – if he’s cultivating a humane exterior to make his theory more palatable. But it's probably just that our backlash against his loud, cartoon atheism overlooks his humanity. 

The first section, where he admits the wonder and difficulty of studying consciousness, and carefully lays out the method ahead, is a model for modern scientifically engaged philosophy – and at the end he suggests a dozen novel, detailed experiments to test his theory (ante up). Can't ignore him.

Minus a point for being twenty years old on a topic where that matters.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7053139)">"Red Ice"</a></h3>

Colin Mackay (1987)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2013<br>
<br>
Bitter, accusatory poems on Stalinism from a self-described "European pessimist" (i.e. in the line of Diogenes, Hobbes, Arnold, Spengler, Schopenhauer). A sensitive man betrayed by the terrible course of communism, he goes in for nihilism:

<blockquote>We were hungry for belief 
hope fed us human flesh.</blockquote>

 
(This isn't generally what it feels like to change your mind on something important; it rings of deconversion rather than grudging error-correction.)

Mackay had a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/sep/02/guardianobituaries.books">terrible time of it</a>, he suffered without even getting thrilling hubris or an heroic end. Many canonical artists had unusually hard lives and/or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity_and_mental_illness">mood disorders</a>. But it's not necessarily that sad people write better. Instead here's what I think happens: audiences do not default to being receptive to others: we need to be woken up to a book, whether by personal recommendation, or shared biographical detail, or some other gimmick. A tragic biography is the most reliable primer. (Witness the <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/217663/amy-winehouse-and-other-posthumous-sales-booms-by-the-numbers">death</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_posthumous_number_ones_on_the_UK_Albums_Chart">bump</a>.) 

(It's not nice to attack the hegemony of the sad in art. 1) They are still good, when they're good; 2) they are often Witnesses, speakers-against-power, and anyone can be crushed by having to do that; 3) leave them some bloody consolation!)

I would love Mackay's poems to be incredible; I was extremely moved by Mackay's (self-published) <a href="http://www.onlineoriginals.com/showitem.asp?itemID=303">suicide diary</a>. But they're just ok. Of moons, angels, deserts, atomisation, Hendrix. Red Ice was written well before Bosnia (the crowning horror of his life), but it's already overflowing with ruined empathy and snarly emptiness and survivor's guilt. 

Are there great paintings in only black and grey? Well, sort of. Calvary features four times in twenty poems.

<blockquote>the mountains are mere hills 
the calvarys are daily and inconspicuous 
and we are retreating into closed worlds</blockquote>



Mackay was trying genocide verse, forty years after <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/adorno/#2">Adorno</a> and twenty-five after <a href="http://rinabeana.com/poemoftheday/index.php/2008/07/27/two-formal-elegies-by-geoffrey-hill/">Geoffrey Hill</a>. (Does it matter, being late to the worst thing ever? No, but do it right, do it new.) The brute fact of the C20th drives him to <a href="http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/holy-wholly-my-own-1987-by-colin-mackay.html">nostalgia</a> and lairy isolation

<blockquote>
[I said] I will be me for the hell of it
[he said] you working-class tory
you aren't worth a shit
</blockquote>

 

So the poems are chaste, romanticism with the innocent wonder ripped out; unleavened except for his spurious racial memory of everything being ok, once. (Wordsworth at Katyn. I do not think highly of Wordsworth.) The long title poem has automatic force, being as it is about the gulags and the shame of apologism (Lenin and Stalin (and Trotsky and...)). But it's also uncompressed, clumsy with rage ("stop these follies of the human race!"). It condemns by MacDiarmid and Sartre by name, which is rare and ok. On hypocrisy, silence on Soviet abuses in favour of focusing on lesser Western crimes:</li>

<blockquote>
  [They told me] 
  "Find something in your own hemisphere!" 
  to salve my Commie conscience with, to express solidarity with. 
  (If only there was someone I could express solidarity with...)
 </blockquote>




There is one poem that really gets somewhere: "<a href="http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/phantoms-1987-by-colin-mckay.html">Phantoms</a>", a fast, vocal, twisted/triumphant repudiation of war and hippies alike.

<blockquote>
One night I rose to count myself and found
that I was loose change from the age of plenty,
little piles of sweaty much-handled hope,
promissary thinknotes tissue-thin
devalued below use,
and I cried then, A dream! a dream!
I am tired of too much reality!
...And I woke,
and stood before my window,
and looked to the West and saw
a giant city that was lit with despair
that stank futility,
and looked to the East and saw
a barbed-wire labour camp reeking
of death, dictators...

O television pop world
of toothpaste and handsome people!
I see I am now a Mirage in your eyes,
an Eagle, a Falcon, a Mig 23, 25, 27,
a Tupolev, a Tornado, a Sukhoi, bigger
better, deadlier armed than before,
swingwinged and shining and lethal,
when in my own sad fantasy fact I am sitting
slumped in sweaty shirt and pants after a night
spent strafing the emotions,
staring at a sunlit breakfast table
with blank and stupid face.
And I turned from the place of aerials
where the screech-hawks of power sit perched
and wandered off, away, far away,
down a long corridor crying for
God to return to the breast of his image
that is lonely, O so lonely, and wandering lost
across the plain, hammered on by the hooves
of daemon horses where
God's jackass
bray.

And though they could hold the thought that lights the beauty of the stars
and leap forward through death
and through the doors of oblivion
there between eternity and the night and the sea
where Blake and Shakespeare and all the prophets
are unread and need not be read -
  still they grin, grin.

No friends, I am not mad,
for I have seen them on the clear horizon,
ghosts of television wars lifelong,
of Algeria, of Indochina, of Ulster
and Ogaden, Sinai and Afghanistan.
I have seen migrations of silver planes
with wing stars red and white
crapping napalm, crapping bombs
high explosive, nuclear, thermo-nuclear, biological.
And I with my tin six-guns
ready to be a hero
firing off caps against such missiles
that some bored but competent officer in the Urals
will launch with a button
blasting philosophy and idealism
and eternal consciousness to hell
in four easy minutes...

Lady be mine, while there is still time,
in a country made for two.
We can find its door if we know no more
than any man and woman do.
Before falls the fire from the blue blue sky
on some lunatic's launching day,
lady be mine, O lady be mine,
let's fuck our lives away.
</blockquote>

Anecdotal evidence of the new culture, which is both orchestrated and predated upon by an amoral mafia state. 

Postmodern dictatorship unnerves me more than the clumsy fascism of the Ba'ath or Juche. It's one thing to steal almost everything from your people; one thing to demean, torture and murder millions; one thing to employ a large fraction of the entire country as rabid unaccountable secret police. Even if you do all of this, your people still know you're evil and long for your death. It says something about me that the perversion of meaning, the co-optation of language, and erasing the possibility of objectivity is more emotionally taxing than straightforward torture kleptocracy ("say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude...").

He is at first hard to credit as real: think Russell Brand crossed with Don Draper crossed with Laurentii Beria. His exploits sound like totally mental conspiracy theories, but are actually(?) open secrets:

<blockquote>... the office of the presidential administration, where Surkov would sit behind a desk with phones bearing the names of all the “independent” party leaders, calling and directing them at any moment, day or night. The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, rendering them absurd. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions...
</blockquote>


The book is all anecdote. He does state some statistics, but without sourcing; the book has no footnotes. We need to do better than this, what with the Kremlin's online troll army. It is journalism, then, not social theory: a picture of a hundred or so people. Russia is so skewed that one can capture some important things about by focussing on the ultra-powerful: Berezovsky and Putin, Surkov and Deripaska. 

Pomerantsev views the "international development consultants" trying to improve matters as bumbling, ineffective ambassadors of our best side. 

He's very glib in attributing daddy issues, as if psychology were that straightforward, as if Freud were that credible. His prose has the distracting, unbalanced sentences of indifferently translated work ("developers steal so much money during construction that even the most VIP, luxury, elite of the skyscrapers cracks and sink ever so quickly"; "out to make a few quick quid"). The drama of it all is wearing: he was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyshockers">Channel 4-style</a> hack documentarian before becoming a respected literary insider. It is much the same as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p04b183c/adam-curtis-hypernormalisation">Adam Curtis'</a> hyperactive, over-theorised view.

But this is still good, outraging and intelligent (e.g. he takes for granted that we will understand the contrast between Kaliningrad as the home of Kant and grand larceny and sleaze). A small salvo of authenticity against the Kremlin's apparent wall of disinformation and corruption.

I wish I knew a better book on the same topic but it's new and behind a language barrier.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2662183)">"Fly and the Fly-Bottle: Encounters With British Intellectuals"</a></h3>

Ved Mehta (1983)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Mar 2015<br>
<br>
Curious portraits of Oxbridge people: the ordinary-language philosophers just as they were awaking from their long radical nap, and the arsey titans of Modern history (Trevor-Roper, Carr, Taylor, Namier). The book was originally a New Yorker series, fitting their house style – gossip about the transcendental – but there’s more gossip than concepts. We get to relive all the angry Times responses to bitchy reviews, learn what Toynbee ordered for dinner at the Athenaeum in late ’62; also the hair colour of everyone involved (Murdoch ‘straight and blonde, recalling the peasant aspect of Saint Joan’). To their faces, Mehta is too much the deferential alumn, tentatively prodding the dons to be unkind about their peers. 

The humans are worth it, if you already care: Austin and Namier are tragic hubristic husks; Hare, Ayer, and Toynbee’s charisma blare straight through Mehta’s quiet journalism. 

The common point between the history and philosophy of the time is both fields' slow recovery from positivism/Wittgensteinian reductionism - the cautious return of theory, and of human posits. (In a sense Wittgenstein was still a reductionist when he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations">a holist</a>, since he obsessed over language even as he denied science's entry into various sides of life.) 

Mehta has some spirit: after meeting Strawson (Snr.) he says “I took my leave of the scaled-down Kant.”; he finishes the book with this wonderful medievalism:

<blockquote>Unless a philosopher finds for us an acceptable faith or synthesis – as Plato and Aristotle did together for their age, and St Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant for theirs – we remain becalmed on a painted ocean of controversy, and for better or worse, insofar as the past is a compass to the future, there will never be anyone to whistle thrice for us and say, once and for all, ‘The game is done! I’ve won! I’ve won!’</blockquote>

Craig Aaron (2002)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2013<br>
<br>
Anthology of news from an American newspaper written largely by leftist academics. But at least these selected pieces are actually a fairly low-ideology portrait of shocking events, unreported or begrudgingly reported by mainstream sources. 

It’s way left of the Guardian and still undeluded. I’d never looked into the Contras scandal which In these Times scooped – if you don’t know, this was that time Reagan-funded murderers imported massive amounts of crack into the US using government money. 

Even the Zizek(!) piece (on 9/11) is low-key, wise, and borne out by history.

<blockquote>Now, we are forced to strike back, to deal with real enemies in the real world … but whom to strike? Whatever the response, it will never hit the right target, bringing us full satisfaction. The spectacle of America attacking Afghanistan would be just that: If the greatest power in the world were to destroy one of the poorest countries, where peasants barely survive on barren hills, would this not be the ultimate case of the impotent acting out? Afghanistan is already reduced to rubble, destroyed by continuous war during the past two decades. The impending attack brings to mind the anecdote about the madman who searches for his lost key beneath a street light; asked why he searches there, when he actually lost the key in a dark corner, he answers: “But it is easier to search under strong light!” Is it not the ultimate irony that Kabul already looks like downtown Manhattan?

 The only way to ensure that it will not happen here again is to prevent it from going on anywhere else. America should learn to humbly accept its own vulnerability as part of this world, enacting the punishment of those responsible as a sad duty, not as an exhilarating retaliation. Even though America’s peace was bought by the catastrophes going on elsewhere, the predominant point of view remains that of an innocent gaze confronting unspeakable evil that struck from the Outside. One needs to gather the courage to recognize that the seed of evil is within us too.

I started taking caffeine quite late, so thought I’d check up on it. This is fun, with lots of historical flavour and scientific wonder. (The coolest fact in it is that the body’s direct link between effort and fatigue is the result of an incredibly elegant cycle using adenosine: the production of energy in the body (by breaking down adenosine triphosphate) is exactly the same process as inducing sleep, as the process’ byproduct adenosine triggers dampening receptors in the brain.) 

He doesn’t give a straight answer to the question “Does our rapid formation of caffeine tolerance make its long-term effects zero-sum?” but the evidence isn’t good.

Thesis is that idea of beauty and of women were so intertwined a hundred years ago that Modernism was misogynistic - i.e. in form, as well as just some of its practitioners happening to be.

Unstereotypical gender sociology: traces the male revolt – years before the sexual revolution – against the comparably rigid breadwinner social role inflicted on them. At the time it was too universal to have a name; it was just known vaguely as 'Conformity' or 'Maturity'. On the white-collar worker:

<blockquote> Their labor had a ghostly quantity that made it hard to quantify and even harder to link to the biochemistry of blood and tissues.
</blockquote>



Its key virtue is that she sympathises (more with the Vidals and Roths than the Menckens and Kerouacs, obviously - but in general too). The key thesis:

<blockquote> In psychiatric theory and popular culture, the image of the irresponsible male blurred into the shadowy figure of the homosexual... Fear of homosexuality kept men in line as husbands and breadwinners; and, at the same time, the association with failure and immaturity made it almost impossible for homosexual men to assert a positive image...

Long, shallow parade of the tsars from 1600 onwards. Focusses on the wars, the mistresses and the lulz, not on welfare or data. Still good if you're completely ignorant, like me. 

One insight: when you read "Peter the Great", or "Catherine the Great" (or indeed Frederick), remember that this epithet only holds if you append "...For an Warmongering Autocrat" in your head. I wanted to like Catherine II, but on gaining power she of course betrays the ideals of her powerless writing.

In lieu of analysis, here's Peter the Great:

<blockquote> 
She was notoriously wanton and untameable. Even after he had married her off to Chernyshev, she was said to have given the tsar VD.
...Peter, suffering from a bladder infection possibly caused by VD, retreated to Astrakhan, but his troops took the key port of Baku.
...back in Petersburg Maria resumed her place as Peter's favourite. Rumours spread that she had given him VD.

The title's misleading: all three of those pro-colonialist environmental factors are merely proximate effects of what he argues is the ultimate cause of world inequality: domesticable crops and livestock on a continent which happens to be oriented in a way that makes its climate very similar across wide latitudes. His theory explicitly disclaims racist explanations of world history - e.g. his chapter on the conquistadors is the most harrowing account I've ever read - and he says things like

<blockquote>When I arrived in New Guinea for the first time, it became clear to me that New Guineans are curious, questioning, talkative people with complex languages and social relationships, on the average at least as intelligent as Europeans and Americans.  In New Guinea, I’m the dope who can’t do elementary things like follow an unmarked trail or light a fire in the rain. </blockquote>

I feel perfectly fair in explaining their rancour by his skilful scientific intrusion on their ill-tended turf. (Diamond was originally an ornithologist and geneticist.)

Engaging and original as it is, his thesis faces a hard explanatory limit: agriculture has not been the limiting factor on economies for more than 200 years, and yet the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divergence">Great Divergence</a> dates from then and not earlier. Diamond could appeal to simple path-dependency: "we win now because we won then" or argue that the technological and military edge yielded land, and that land yielded the economic miracle. But the evidence (also known as Gregory Clark) certainly does not warrant crop or zoological supremacism.

Anyway I know of no better introduction to cultural evolution theory, human population genetics, the Clovis / pre-Clovis controversy, philology, New Guinean traditionalism, the origins and downsides of civilization, animal husbandry, and the ancient history of Africa. The rub is that you can't stop with him, because he doesn't go for all the angles.

(c) Red Rationality (1987) by Wang Guangyi</div>

A slightly strained oral history of the least romanticised scientists: Bayesian statisticians. She makes up for the long-missing romanticism single-handed! The two-hundred year eclipse of the Bayesian method was much longer than that suffered by even the irrationally-maligned <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Continental_drift#/Rejection_of_Wegener.27s_theory.2C_1910s.E2.80.931950s">continental drift</a> theory (50 years). And this neglect and opprobrium was suffered by a paradigm now accepted everywhere as powerful and useful in literally all kinds of research. 

She wins us over, particularly with her chapter on the secretive, truculent, omnicompetent genius John Tukey, who used Bayesian methods for elections 40 years before <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">Fivethirtyeight</a>, with comparable success. But her prose is borderline, with lots of clear but dim-bulb sentences. 

She has one infuriating mannerism: she constantly refers to Bayes' rule, Bayesian logical foundations after Bayes, Bayesian inference, and personalist Bayesian epistemology by the single terrible metonym "Bayes":

<blockquote>At its heart, Bayes runs counter to the deeply held conviction that science requires total objectivity and precision. Bayes is a measure of belief.

...even many nonstatisticians regarded Swinburne's lack of care and measurement as a black mark against Bayes itself.

...Bayes, on the other hand, seemed to produce results that corresponded more closely to sociologists' intuitions.

...Wagner took along the youngest and greenest of his three-man staff, Henry Richardson, who had earned a PhD in probability theory all of seven months earlier. He would be Bayes' point man at Palomares.</blockquote>


I suppose she did this to elide away jargon, but it both equivocates between very different entities, hides the complexity of the 'Bayesian' marquee, invites the idea that the frequentists were attacking a logically sound theorem, and produces a whole list of bizarre images, where we see the reclusive Reverend doing all these things: cracking Enigma and Tunny, finding H-Bombs lost at sea, calculating appropriate worker's comp amounts in the absence of reliable data, attributing The Federalist Papers to Hamilton, and blocking 99.9% of the spam email from reaching you (yes, you). 

It is also even more unfair to Laplace than usual. (It was he who developed Bayesianism into the powerful applied framework it is, into more than a single gambler's theorem. Ok, so "Laplace-Coxism" is admittedly even less admissible as a term to which the wise and honest may repair.) 

Grammatical twitching aside this was a fun introduction to an important thing.

She focusses on the soft, social side (and on applications vaguely summarised). There was a huge amount of factional bitching between these serious and cloistered men:

<blockquote>Attending his first Bayesian conference in 1976, Jim Berger was shocked to see half the room yelling at the other half. Everyone seemed to be good friends, but their priors were split between the personally subjective, like Savage's, and the objective, like Jeffrey's - with no definitive experiment to decide the issue.
In a frustrated circle of blame, Persi Diaconis was shocked and angry when John Pratt used frequentist methods to analyze his wife's movie theater attendance data, because it was too much for the era's computers to handle. But one of the low moments of Diaconis' life occurred in a Berkeley coffee shop, where he was correcting proofs of an article of his and where Lindley blamed him for using frequency methods. "And you're our leading Bayesian", Lindley complained. Lindley, in turn, upset Mosteller by passing up a chance to conduct a big project using Bayes instead of frequency...
Asked how to encourage Bayesian theory, Lindley answered tartly, "Attend funerals".</blockquote>


This human focus means she gives no treatment of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cox's_theorem">Cox's theorem</a>, certainly the most remarkable result in formal epistemology (and probability theory?), and one of the main things which rationally warrants the partisanship and excitement she displays for Bayesian thought throughout. ("<a href="http://biasandbelief.pbworks.com/w/page/6537213/References%20on%20the%20Cox%20Proof">Justified fundamentalism</a>", as one great commentator puts it!) It proves that any attempt to use numbers to model belief must be Bayesian or logically equivalent to it. With other results, it raises Bayesianism to the only viable quantitative theory of rationality and of right learning, a behemoth of which Aristotelian logic is a mere special case. No doubt I'm unusual in finding this the most exciting bit.

She's to be applauded for digging out novel examples of Bayesian analysis which were classified or which avoided using the word: early actuarial work, Tukey's US election model, the pre-Three-Mile-Island federal report of reactor safety, and the entire field of operational research. But she is so concerned with emphasising the (genuine) long oppression of the paradigm that she under-emphasises the good reasons to resist Bayesian methods before 1980: they were simply computationally intractable before MCMC. (Which makes the sheer effort put in to shortcuts and approximation methods by ingenious people quite tragic; they just aren't needed anymore, thirty years later.) To her credit, she does mention the parallel dogmatism of the 60s Bayesians and the presumptive overenthusiasm of some people in the last 10 years. 

(The great contemporary frequentist, Deborah Mayo, is able to subtitle her blog "<a href="https://errorstatistics.com/about-2/">Frequentists in Exile</a>" without being absurd - even though Stats 101 and "Methods for [Social Science]" courses are still everywhere dominated by canned Fisherian tests and frames. She means exile from the philosophy of statistics and probability.)

Insofar as you want to understand the large trends of the present and coming age, you need to know its economics; insofar as you must understand the new economics, you must understand AI; insofar as you must understand AI, you must understand machine learning and decision theory; insofar as you must understand machine learning, you must understand <a href="http://blog.shakirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bayes_Deep.pdf">both frequentism and Bayesianism</a>. Insofar as you do not yet have the mathematics to understand Bayesianism, nor the excitement of the promise of a final, real synthesis of objective with subjective, you must read this gentle prose work. Once you are excited by its vague promises, you can find progressively more rigorous people and will have actually have reason to stomach the formalism.

3/5, 4*/5 for those just beginning the march.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745495)">"A Structured Approach to the Adam Smith Problem"</a></h3>

Hodder, Christopher (2016)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2016<br>
<br>
The third PhD I have ever read, the first to which I've contributed, and certainly the best-written. ”The "Adam Smith Problem" is just that Smith's two big books seem to dramatically contradict each other: <a href="http://econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html">WoN</a> is methodologically and normatively individualist and abstracts out the economy from the rest of human life, but <a href="http://econlib.org/library/Smith/smMS0.html">ToMS</a> is a holistic and altruistic picture, one which subsumes economic behaviour as a special case of all virtuous or vicious actions. Hodder's job, which, remarkably, went undone over 200 years of scholarly debate, is to consider the possible explanations (e.g. "Smith divides society into disjoint private and public spheres"; "one of the two books is ironic"; "he changed his mind"; "he was a idjit") through close exegesis and logical reconstruction, and somehow weigh them.

The conclusion is satisfying enough: What is the Adam Smith Problem?: A debate on a problem; the debate was the problem. Basically, a series of bad readers (from the German Historicists to Paul Samuelson) misread certain key terms and passages, imputed an anachronistic atheism and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes#Agent">efficient-causation</a> empiricism to him, and then propagated a straw-man ("a <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/226156/pdf">shadow history</a>") throughout the secondary literature and the tertiary sewer we call the media. (They also missed the timing and the explicit initial audience of WoN: the book is avowedly a polemic to affect British trade policy, and a highly successful one at that.)

Hodder writes with absolutely minimal jargon; this is as easily grasped as C18th political economy can be. One of my notes was that an institutionalised marker might penalise it for omitting jargon to the degree it does; after all, what's the point if just anyone can waltz in to constructive thought without using the gaudy tools made in desperation by knowledge pieceworkers?:

<blockquote>
Sympathy plays a far more foundational role in WN than has previously been noted by any scholar which I have encountered. If we return to the butcher, brewer and baker, example, where we address ourselves not to their benevolence but to their self-interest, all commentators seem to have overlooked the question of how we are to go about addressing ourselves to another's self-interest. The obvious and simple answer to this is Sympathy. We put ourselves in their place, we realise that they expect to be paid for their labour as we would expect to be paid for our own, and as a result we understand that the appropriate behaviour expected of us is to pay for their service. In the primitive society, where the hunter begins to trade his bows for food and starts down the long road towards commercial society, it must be Sympathy which alerts his fellow hunters that he wants something in return for the bows he produces. “Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want” requires that I can escape my own self-interest and understand what you want, and have at least a basic level of Sympathy for you otherwise I would not know what to offer you.

Sympathy must therefore apply to trade at a very foundational level, and that intimate Sympathy which fosters benevolence can take hold even in business relationships. All it requires is repeated dealings with the same person, and a character which is “well-disposed”. It is not said to be central to society - but this is entirely consistent with TMS, where Smith describes benevolence as “the ornament that embellishes” society, that which makes it happier rather than merely efficient.</blockquote>


I do wonder at the fact that someone with no historiographical background and only half an economics degree could make substantive corrections and suggestions at the very frontier of the field's knowledge of a canonical figure. In one way this is nice: reason is a universal solvent, and specific facts make up relatively little of total intellectual work! But in another way sad: the pompousness and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary-work">boundary-work</a> of the non-formal academic fields is again shown to be needless, and narrowing.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29429893)">"Blitzed: Drugs in Nazi Germany"</a></h3>

Norman Ohler (2016)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2017<br>
<br>
Such an insultingly dumb plot - "the Nazis act as they do because they are all on crystal meth" - except it's nonfiction and quite plausible. The 70-hour assaults of Blitzkrieg in particular could not have happened without heavy stimulants. And Hitler becomes much more understandable when you learn of his ten year binge on injected pharmaceuticals. 

Juicy bits:

<blockquote>[Around 1923] forty per cent of Berlin doctors were said to be addicted to morphine

Telling propaganda: ‘[Hitler] mortifies his body in a way that would shock people like us! He doesn’t drink, he practically only eats vegetables, and he doesn’t touch women.’ Hitler allegedly didn’t even allow himself coffee and legend had it that after the First World War he threw his last pack of cigarettes into the Danube near Linz; from then onwards, supposedly, no poisons would enter his body.

Telling propaganda: ‘For decades our people have been told by Marxists and Jews: “Your body belongs to you.” That was taken to mean that at social occasions between men, or between men and women, any quantities of alcohol could be enjoyed, even at the cost of the body’s health. Irreconcilable with this Jewish Marxist view is the Teutonic German idea that we are the bearers of the eternal legacy of our ancestors, and that accordingly our body belongs to the clan and the people.’

Chocolates spiked with methamphetamine were even put on the market. A good 14 milligrams of methamphetamine was included in each individual choc – almost five times the amount in a [prescription] pill.</blockquote>


Ohler argues that drugs have been overlooked as the (unsustainable) engine of the Nazi economic recovery, and of the alien intensity of the ideology, because people took Goebbels at his word about the Nazi drive for natural organic wellness and purity and so ignored this 'medicine' that millions of Germans were supplied by the state and IG. I don't know whether Ohler is making a revisionist stretch or not, but certainly Pervitin had a role.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45771)">"Signifying Rappers: Rap and Race in the Urban Present"</a></h3>

Mark Costello (1997)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2016<br>
<br>
The first book on hip-hop? Certainly the first High Academic one. Though, not really a book, as they frequently acknowledge: it's a "sampler". And not expert, as they constantly acknowledge: more than half of it is them pseudo-nervously hedging about being two elite white guys peering into what was then a fairly closed circle. A solid effort too - it knows and guesses and connects more than most critics today, despite the scene being far more ethnically closed, and far less obviously of artistic wealth; despite their often comically mishearing the lyrics; and despite not being able to find anything out about the people behind the music, because no-one returned their calls (until they pretended to be journalists).
 
Anyway this has 80pp of recognisably enervated DFW popping off the top of this allocortex, decent fuel for the fire of an admirer, or at any rate the only coal on offer (he was embarrassed by this book, but it is too stylish and enthusiastic to be embarrassing to us):

<blockquote>
Ironies abound, of course, as ironies must when cash and art do lunch. Tearing down the prop-thin symbolic walls, Run-DMC aim to celebrate desegregation, but miss the fact that Aerosmith, those whitest of white rockers, are merely big-budget Led Zeppelin ripoffs, and that Led Zep came straight outta the jet-black Rhythm & Blues of Chicago’s Chess Records. Dancing with Steve Tyler, Run-DMC forgets that Muddy Waters’ sideman Willie Dixon had to sue Led Zeppelin to get proper credit for their use of his blues. “Walk This Way” is an unwanted reunion of 80s black street music with part of its rich heritage, as that heritage has been mined and mongrelized by Show Biz. If this is desegregation, then shopping malls hold treasure...

It’s a new and carnivorous kind of mimesis that makes weary old ‘self-reference’ actually kind of interesting, because it enlarges Self from the standard rock-subjective–a bundle of hormone-drenched emotions attached to a larynx and pelvis–to a 'big ole head,’ a kind of visual street-corner, a monadic Everybrother, an angry, jaded eye on a centerless pop-culture country full of marginalized subnations that are themselves postmodern, looped, self-referential, self-obsessed, voyeuristic, passive, slack-jawed, debased, and sources of such prodigious signal-and-data bombardment that they seem to move faster than the angry eye itself can see…</blockquote>


I had been putting off reading this because of the title: I didn't know about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-PxCWwu5kQ">Schooly D</a>'s track, so I read the verb in a gross academic voice ("in which we give rappers true signification") rather than the adjectival sense they actually meant ("rappers who signify").
Costello's bits are ok, DJ "MC" to MC "DFW". Wallace is harder than Costello - noting that MCs really are just yuppies, that Chuck D's claims to not be glorifying violence are absurd, that part of the fascination of hard rap is the snuff-spiral of trying to be nastier and nastier than previous hard rappers, which is just the commercial impulse of Alice Cooper minus musicianship. But this is also a winning early bet: that rap is poetry, that it was and would be "the decade's most important and influential pop movement":

<blockquote>
Our opinion, then, from a distance: not only is serious rap poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great U.S. Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we’ve been encouraged sadly to write off, it’s quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. ‘Real’ (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocal, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn’t get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers..
</blockquote>


Your enjoyment will depend on you giving a crap about the sheer horror of rap's initial context and being able to tolerate intentionally torturous pomo prose and juxtapositions (e.g. I Dream of Jeannie vs race riots). I loved it and twice missed my stop on the tube reading it.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10887)">"Kissinger"</a></h3>

Walter Isaacson (2005)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2017<br>
<br>
Balanced coverage of the great monster, including his meteoric rise from penniless immigrant German Jew to a permanent spot in the highest caste of global influence; his academic conceit (the longest-ever thesis at Harvard), and his ceaseless inveigling and brown-nosing. (In case you don't know, Kissinger is probably the greatest war criminal in American history.) Res ipsa loquitur:

<blockquote>Whenever peace — conceived as the avoidance of war — has been the primary objective of a power or a group of powers, the international system has been at the mercy of the most ruthless member of the international community. [A more proper goal is] stability based on an equilibrium of forces.

If I had to choose between justice and disorder, on the one hand, and injustice and order, on the other, I would always choose the latter.</blockquote>



There's not a lot of editorial from Isaacson. He respects Kissinger's single-mindedness and intellectual clout, while giving us plenty of his egotism and blandly evil wonkishness:

<blockquote>
Here was an example of what would become a pattern in Kissinger’s diplomacy: his attempt to mediate a dispute by finding a semantic formulation to finesse differences. In this case it was devising a phrase that linked the bombing halt to the negotiations, without sounding like a condition. Later, at the end of the war, he would search for ambiguous phrases about the demilitarized zone and South Vietnamese sovereignty that could be read differently in Hanoi and Saigon. Sometimes these word games paid off. But usually they opened Kissinger up to accusations that he had left important disagreements unresolved by talking out of both sides of his mouth.

[during the 1970 election, R v N ] At the convention, the Rockefeller forces, with little to lose, sent Kissinger to talk to the Iowa delegation. “It was so novel to me,” he told a reporter at the time. “I’d never met working politicians before. I didn’t attempt to talk their language. I just talked what I knew.” The Iowa delegation voted overwhelmingly for Nixon.</blockquote>



Isaacson soft-pedals the mass chaos and death Kissinger gave rise to. And much more has come to light about Kissinger's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/opinion/sunday/nixons-vietnam-treachery.html?_r=0">personal</a> <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/henry-kissinger-hillary-clintons-tutor-in-war-and-peace/">responsibility</a> for it, since Isaacson published this. 

Dr Strangelove wasn't based on Kissinger, but I find it impossible not to think of Peter Sellars (or Woody Allen) when reading about the tragic success of this erotomaniacal egomaniac.

Hitchens' Trial of Henry Kissinger is much more salient.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939268)">"Universal Harvester"</a></h3>

John Darnielle (2017)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2017<br>
<br>
A horror story without antagonist. Honouring and questioning rural homeliness and human twistedness. Haunting, in a toothache-on-the-brain style, and with his characteristic eye for detail, but not operating at the heights of ravaged beauty we know he can reach.

<blockquote>In the movies, people almost never talked about the towns they spent their lives in; they ran around having adventures and never stopped to get their bearings. It was weird, when you thought about it. They only remembered where they were from if they wanted to complain about how awful it was there, or, later, to remember it as a place of infinite promise, a place whose light had been hidden from them until it became unrecoverable, at which point its gleam would become impossible to resist.</blockquote>


There are perhaps too many passages that drift off from a concrete event into abstraction, and which then finish on a short, suggestive raised-eyebrow sort of sentence. Like:

<blockquote>
He had lost a lot of blood. His eyes were half-open, and he seemed to recognize that somebody he knew was with him, but he said nothing. He drew great, deep breaths at intervals. The sky above was showing early afternoon flashes of orange, its constant variations flooding the horizon in changing color bars like on the title screen from that weird Charles Bronson movie, the one where he steals a sword from Toshiro Mifune on a train. Red Sun."</blockquote>

Joel Paris (2008)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2013<br>
<br>

Not what you’d expect (“DSM hiss!! Pharma woo!!”). An ‘evidence-based psychiatrist’ (a good guy), his main target is people who overinterpret current neuroscience and just churn out pills. He concedes that the old analysts were ‘brainless’ but calls the worst of the new brain-scan boom ‘mindless’. 

The evidence for talk therapy – things like CBT (for anxiety and personality disorders) – is much better than I’d thought, and Paris reckons this is now overlooked in favour of cheaper and truthier biological determinism. 

A good, hard thing to say: “What causes mental illness? By and large, advances in neuroscience notwithstanding, we still don’t know.”

Nice gentle probe of our faddish fear that tech is pumping too much info through us, and thereby vitiates our branes and produces ADHD. Working memory, if you haven’t heard, is trumpeted as the constitutive component of intelligence.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/392256)">"Desperately Seeking Paradise: Journeys Of A Sceptical Muslim"</a></h3>

Ziauddin Sardar (2005)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2013<br>
<br>
Wanted a life of Muhammad to match the life of Luther, but the available biographies were credulous, downplaying his Machiavellian – or rather, since he was successful, his ‘Napoleonic’ – accomplishments and mercantile background. 

So, the ‘sceptical Muslim’ it is: Sardar has been everywhere, involved in every other big event in the Muslim world for 40 years. He gets beaten up by Iranian revolutionaries; sees Bin Laden in Peshawar in ‘85; is offered £5m by the Saudis to shut up; is at Anwar’s side in Malaysia; his nephew worked in the WTC in late 2001. 

He shows the full crushing procession of forces in Muslims’ lives – Western bootprints old and new, Israel locking up 1.6 million and scattering a million others to the wind, the former Ba’athists, the Brotherhood, the ‘simpleton’ Tablighi Jamaat, Saudi power soft and hard, and a dozen home-grown oppressions and gross inequalities. 

Sardar in the middle: willing the backward chaos to end, but recoiling from the resulting medieval theocracies. “But maybe paradise does not want to be found”. Bit aimless but I suppose instructive.

<br>
Pop account of near-future technological accelerations and explosions. (AKA transhumanism v bioconservatism.) We face four types of dislocating technologies: Genetics, Robotics, Infotech and Nanotech. 

Garreau gives loads of stage time to two dogmatic cranks from each side: Kurzweil (booster technocrat), and Fukuyama (neocon fearmonger) as well as an unclassifiable polymath, Jaron Lanier. But this is sadly just the way <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ">science journalism is done</a>, and Garreau is later courageous in half-endorsing the transcendent transhuman rationale of beautiful bioprogressive Bostrom. Unfortunately his prose is Gladwellian, full of glib pop references and leaden line-break punch-lines. Still a balanced intro to the scenarios and figureheads.

<br>
Don’t like nature poets. The post-Thoreau tend to be casually nihilistic about science and humanity, however much beauty and innocence they display. 

But Heaney’s a naturalist, not a nature poet. He talks about the same few things – stone, dirt, the nature of light for a child, the act of building, wind – hundreds of times and still casts newness. It hurts to read for some reason – he’s never miserable, and rarely handles even abstract tragedy explicitly, but I get tight behind my eyes.

Incredibly detailed and fresh, but also repetitive and indiscriminate. Had to think quite hard looking at some of the many diagrams showing e.g. hundreds of thousands of years of almost-noise recombination.

Archeology has been transformed in the last decade, by the ancient DNA hunt. Reich allows us something precious, to see large and profound errors corrected, nearly as they are first discovered.

<br>
Lots to dislike but I like it. The prose is just a voiceover: short sentences, newline punchlines, chatty laddish bluster. You wouldn't want to spend time with young Bourdain; too edgy, too miserable, too addled. At no point does he disown his wild years, but this is written as a different, charming, distant man. I suppose this made him a star because honesty and filth are rare in high cuisine, or in the received notion of high cuisine. He refers to himself as a "cook" throughout (or even "cookie"), endearingly. 

Anyone else playing at being a junkie cuisinier, sexual tyrannosaurus, smash-hit author, primetime travel host, and, most recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmgRXUmYncE">jiujitsu japer</a> would surely be risible. But his enthusiasm is convincing.

It may well be that Bourdain was <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-good-is-Anthony-Bourdain-as-a-chef">a 6/10 chef</a>; I can tell you he's a 6/10 writer, at least as prose goes. But domains multiply when they intersect.

Yanis Varoufakis (2016)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2017<br>
<br>
Much better than I thought it'd be! Literary, clear, almost bipartisan. As a former socialist finance minister, he has a healthy blend of actual economic knowledge and smouldering will to improve an irrational status quo. (He uses "irrational" far more than the usual pejoratives: "greedy" or "exploitative" or "neoliberal".) 

He makes lots of literary allusions and shares personal tales of fascist Greece. These make the deadly dull business of postwar European monetary politics readable. He talks about the duty of surplus nations to stabilize the world system, which is true and good but unworkable. He has a remarkable admiration for American institutions and figures - not just the New Dealers, but also, in a way, for Volcker and Geithner - while also pointing out astutely. Full marks for tone, basically. 

A good writer, with only a couple of wrongfooted sentences. Potted history of post-war international macroeconomics. 

His policies do not much resemble socialism: all the same neoliberal institutions exist in Varoufakisland. He'd just use them to help the vulnerable. 

America (Harry White, Volcker) had a chance to stabilise the world, but instead grabbed national interest at the expense of others. Then - according to Varoufakis - they grabbed hegemony at the expense of their own, which is even more depressing.

His current-account focussed theory is a bit narrow. There is already a eurozone surplus recycling mechanism, for instance. His 2015 Greek finance policies continue to look better than the current blind bailout plus permadeflation solution: Greece should have defaulted. His (and Holland's) recommendations are very sensible.

Despite being short, it is really repetitive; I skimmed chapters 4-6 heavily. It is also disappointingly short on <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?dcr=0&ei=tPArWvfTNYLjUZaFqrAG&q=geithner+%22foot+on+the+neck%22&oq=geithner+%22foot+on+the+neck%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3...20157.22901.0.23060.4.4.0.0.0.0.237.567.0j2j1.3.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.0.0....0.E3lBGUarhPE">private gossip</a> about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_troika">dark back-corridors</a> of Brussels; he saved that for the next book.

Versified well, which makes even the boring bits about ploughs a pleasure. I read this aloud, and me and the audience had a long inconclusive discussion about how many of the claims are likely to be complete bullshit. 

Most interesting were: the prevalence of Greek myths among the Goths, and Tacitus' very early cross-cultural approval of some things.

<blockquote>For when on chastity a woman cheats 
She finds no mercy among the tribesmen
And cannot come by a husband again
No matter how young and rich and fair
Nobody laughs at these vices there
Or calls corruption a sign of the times.

Better still are the nations in those climes
Where virgins once only marry,
Willing for the right mate to tarry;
They take one husband, one body, one life -
No other thought or longing needs a wife
Who loves more than her man the married state...</blockquote>

<br>
Funny, bitchy slander of the hippies and pseuds of a century ago. Vague, snobbish, hypocritical, self-congratulatory, appropriative: that is, not much has changed in our New Agers. 

Repetitive – too many puns about howdahs, etc – and more than three-quarters of it assumes the voices of rhythmically insufferable idiots. 

Anyway its real value, apart from hammering home the difference between Marquis’ own true poetic voice and the banal vers libre he merely uses here, is as history lesson. Orientalist, relativist bohemian mysticism was far from an innovation of the Sixties, since the cant and conceit of Hermione's guests is a perfect match. 

Notice that, even while despairing of Hermione, Marquis hangs around her all the same, a hanger-on to hangers-on. <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hermione_and_Her_Little_Group_of_Serious_Thinkers">Give it an hour.</a>

Friendly and sensible grab-bag. He’s certainly much, much more trustworthy than other humanities academics, on either topic. 

His main question: what implications do the new cognitive and biological sciences have for yr subjective life and art? How damaged would the great novels be by decentreing and anti-human stuff? 

(Aside from the long and thoughtful opening essay, inspired in large part by Dennett, we are given a jovial bunch to consider: Dickens, Forster, Amis elder and younger, James, Updike, with Roth and Kierkegaard the outliers.) Closing interview, with Craig Raine, is seriously stilted, but it’s because he doesn’t want to play the invited game, waffling deepity. And so this book: refusing to hide from the reality of the mind, succeeding in holding books to that reality, against great odds.

Extended essay on the macroeconomics of space bitcoin and the Graeberian lightness of debt. Also dead good breakneck fun, as always. Protagonist is a historian of finance and a gentle soul in ravenous space capitalism. Set in the Saturn’s Children world, with perhaps too much in common with that book (a powerful, psychotic matriarch antagonist; economic pressure as main plot driver; a serially manipulated and unviolent lead; space travel is shit). But good.

Donella H. Meadows (2008)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Apr 2015<br>
<br>
An attempt to make holism rigorous; given holism's deep intuitive appeal for people, the attempt is worthy. But I was hostile to this at first – mostly because her field helped breed a generation of pseuds who use ‘reductionism’ as an insult (rather than as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">a straightforward fact</a>, or a useful way of thinking, instances of which denote the highest achievements of the species). Let's get clear:

<blockquote>
 “REDUCTIONISM” (to the pseud): The claim that complicated or immeasurable things do not exist.
 “SYSTEMS THEORY” (to the pseud): The only way of understanding things: as a whole. Everything else omits and so isn't full.
 
 REDUCTIONISM (ontology): The claim that complicated things are made of simpler things. Only the simplest of them are physically real; the rest are mental models of their interactions.*
 REDUCTIONISM (methodology): The attempt to isolate causes and treat phenomena in terms of their most basic units (whether quark, string, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodological_individualism">person</a>, transaction).
 SYSTEMS THEORY: When things get together, they exhibit features the individual things don’t.
</blockquote>



So stated, there is no conflict between good old reduction and shiny systems thinking. But Meadows distils the juicy bits into &lt;200pp here, and freely admits that systems theory has an intractable indeterminacy built into it, and says this, too:

<blockquote> Ever since the Industrial Revolution, Western society has benefited from science, logic, and reductionism over intuition and holism. Psychologically and politically we would much rather assume that the cause of a problem is “out there,” rather than “in here.” It’s almost irresistible to blame something or someone else, to shift responsibility away from ourselves, and to look for… the technical fix that will make a problem go away.

 Serious problems have been solved by focusing on external agents — preventing smallpox, increasing food production, moving large weights and many people rapidly over long distances. Because they are embedded in larger systems, however, some of our “solutions” have created further problems… Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability, unemployment, chronic disease, drug addiction, and war, for example, persist in spite of the analytical ability and technical brilliance that have been directed toward eradicating them. No one deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist nonetheless.

 That is because they are intrinsically systems problems – undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them. They will yield only as we reclaim our intuition, stop casting blame, see the system as the source of its own problems, and find the courage and wisdom to restructure it.
</blockquote>



Can it resolve empirical questions the way physics does, though? In saying, probably rightly, that a flow could go either way, depending on the state of the rest of the system and neighbouring systems, you lose or sideline <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimentum_crucis">crucial</a> power to find out a single cause's influence, and thereby know more or less exactly what to do to the system. In other places, knowledge comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus">isolating causes</a>. A reductionist can agree with all the clever diagrams in this, happily concede that they illustrate the gnarly problems of collective action and feedback and other ecosystems very clearly - and not give up their peerlessly successful method / ontological stance at all.

PHYSICALISM: Everything is made of physical things. (However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism#Strawsonian_physicalism">the physical may be stranger than you think.</a>) </blockquote>

<br>
Sharp and original mismash of intellectual history, law, political economy, as well as an ok bit of polemical sociology and theory of Design. His targets are the 'solutionists', those technocrat techies who derive from the half of the Enlightenment which became positivism. (It is roughly: the will to perfect things and people, plus theorism, plus economism, plus the sheer power and scope of modern software.) Morozov is, bluntly, afraid for us all because software is eating the world:

<blockquote>Imperfection, ambiguity, opacity, disorder and the opportunity to err, to sin: all of these are constitutive of human freedom, and any concentrated attempt to root them out will root out that freedom as well... we risk finding ourselves with a politics devoid of everything that makes politics desirable, with humans who have lost their basic capacity for moral reasoning, with lackluster cultural institutions that don't take risks and, most terrifyingly, with a perfectly controlled social environment that would make dissent not just  impossible but possibly even unthinkable...</blockquote>



But I do not want the freedom to believe harmful falsehoods, nor the freedom to hide my errors behind ambiguity; nor the freedom to throw away resources which others need. And I don't want the freedom to waste my life. Technology is the only untried way of responding to our grave Darwinian inheritance of intolerance, selfishness, and irrationality. But Morozov makes his case well about the specific case of technologised politics.

Repetitive and overwrought, but also of course astonishing and extravagant and humane. Quirky case-study format and title suggest a voyeuristic pop sci jaunt, but it’s deadly serious, theoretically couched, concerned with the poor buggers’ well-being. He’s against “mindless neurology and bodiless psychology”, the cognitive elitism and relegation of emotion and spirit of his field.

“Disease is not always just an affliction, but sometimes a proud engine of altered states” – so we see a man with severe Tourette’s is an excellent pro jazz drummer, a woman with debilitating migraines is the polymath Hildegard of Bingen. 

Sacks has a funny habit of using philosophers’ names as misrepresentative pejoratives – a man with radical amnesia is a ‘Humean’ (: a flow of unrelated sensations), a woman who loses sense of her own body has a ‘Wittgensteinian’ life (: doubting the hinge proposition ‘here is a hand’). Actually, that last one works, never mind.

Little counterfactuals involving single decisions in single lives that would (probably) have had vast effects on the present world. Needed this book because, at my school, the big historical cliches - Hastings - were divorced from their effects. Had Socrates died before meeting Plato, two thousand years of persuasive anti-democratic thought might have been prevented; had Zheng He just kept going, a Confucian America without a divine mandate to convert and subjugate, and an overwhelmed, boxed-in and thus united pre-colonial Europe might have resulted.

<blockquote>It may be coincidental, but it is suggestive nonetheless that the interest among serious historians in counterfactual analysis basically corresponds with the rise of a dramatically new way of looking at the physics of complex systems, known popularly as chaos theory.</blockquote>



They are also just great stories, cf. Adam Gopnik's

<blockquote>It is the aim of all academic historians in our time to drain as much drama from history as is consistent with the facts; and it is the goal of popular historians to add as much drama to history as is consistent with the facts, or can be made to seem so.

This is the former people doing the latter work. Damn good fun, and maybe valuable in the absence of proper modelling.

<br>
Christ: difficult. Very brief, very ordinary, and yet unsettling. 

Her language looks very clear – it's jargon-free – but on engaging with it you see it's blurred, terse, arduous. She never introduces the question at hand, nor does she make any introduction at all: on page 1 she sets about the concept with a monologue, an air of Wittgenstein's observational tragedy. 

Anyway I'm pretty sure it's about the problem of intention (‘what answers ‘why?’, and why does it?’ Or: ‘how can teleology be explained in terms of brute causation (science)?’). 

I think her points are that: 

* <li>intentions are justified with reasons and not evidence; </li>
* <li>intentional explanation is not causal explanation; </li>
* <li>intentional action is not amenable to a naturalist reduction (because to explain an action with reasons is precisely to not explain it with laws of nature); that intention is not a mental state but a process involving (?); </li>
* <li>that we have synthetic but non-observational and non-inferential knowledge of the world; </li>
* <li>that we have this simply because we 'know about' our bodies and intentions.</li>

(That needs more work to be representative: 
1) if you don’t know that you are doing something, you’re not doing it intentionally; 
2) if it’s only during, or after the fact that you infer you’re doing something, you can’t be doing it for reasons. 
So) if you are doing something intentional, you necessarily know you are doing it. 

She thinks this knowledge isn’t based on observing oneself or post-hoc theorising.

Intention was intended as the first piece of the first 'proper', psychologised account of agency. (She thought one needed an action theory before one could have a real moral theory. But consequentialism sidesteps that need, just as it ducks the free-will responsibility question, and the warm-glow problem, and the meta-ethical status of moral language... But a key need, one consequentialism can never avoid, is people’s need to assert their own importance and metaphysical uniqueness.)

If you take nothing else from it, take the "reasons" vs "causes" distinction seriously. It is a real problem, necessary for serious inquiry into humans.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1163691)">"Two Kafka Plays: Kafka's Dick and the Insurance Man"</a></h3>

Alan Bennett (1988)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2017<br>
<br>
KD is fun and uncliched but quite didactic. Its irreverence is not mostly directed at Kafka, despite the aggressive-seeming title. 

IM relies heavily on lighting, juxtaposition, and Daniel Day-Lewis' tics. Either play is much more likely to endear Kafka to you than his own books, or any of the absurd battery of critical texts on him. 

This is my favourite thing on Kafka:

<blockquote>There are many perils in writing about Kafka. His work has been garrisoned by armies of critics with some fifteen thousand books about him at the last count. As there is a Fortress Freud so is there a Fortress Kafka, Kafka his own castle. For admission a certain high seriousness must be deemed essential and I am not sure I have it. One is nervous about presuming even to write his name, wanting to beg pardon for doing so, if only because Kafka was so reluctant to write his name himself. Like the Hebrew name of God, it is a name that should not be spoken, particularly by an Englishman. In his dreams Kafka once met an Englishman. He was in a good grey flannel suit, the flannel also covering his face... The Channel is a slipper bath of irony through which we pass these serious Continentals in order not to be infected by their gloom. This propensity I am sure I have not escaped or tried to: but then there is something that is English about Kafka, and it is not only his self-deprecation. A vegetarian and fond of the sun, he seems a familiar crank; if he’d been living in England at the turn of the century, and not in Prague, one can imagine him going out hiking and spending evenings with like-minded friends in Letchworth...

In that department [DIY] certainly Kafka did not excel. He was not someone you would ask to help put up a shelf, for instance, though one component of his charm was an exaggerated appreciation of people who could, and of commonplace accomplishments generally. Far from being clumsy himself (he had something of the dancer about him), he would marvel (or profess to marvel) at the ease with which other people managed to negotiate the world. This kind of professed incompetence (‘Silly me!’) often leads to offers of help, and carried to extremes it encourages the formation of unofficial protection societies. Thus Kafka was much cosseted by the ladies in his office and in the same way the pupils of another candidate for secular sainthood, the French philosopher Simone Weil, saw to it that their adored teacher did not suffer the consequences of a practical un-wisdom even more hopeless than Kafka’s.

One cannot say that Kafka’s marvelling at mundane accomplishments was not genuine, was a ploy. The snag is that when the person doing the marvelling goes on to do great things this can leave those with the commonplace accomplishments feeling a little flat. Say such a person goes on to win the Nobel Prize: it is scant consolation to know that one can change a three-pin plug.

Gorky said that in Chekhov’s presence everyone felt a desire to be simpler, more truthful and more oneself. Kafka too had this effect. ‘On his entrance into a room,’ wrote a contemporary, ‘it seemed as though some unseen attendant had whispered to the lecturer: “Be careful about everything you say from now on. Franz Kafka has just arrived.” ’ To have this effect on people is not an unmixed blessing. When we are on our best behaviour we are not always at our best.

This is not to say that Kafka did not make jokes in life and in art. The Trial, for instance, is a funnier book than it has got credit for and Kafka’s jokes about himself are the better for the desperate circumstances in which they were often made. He never did win the Nobel Prize but contemplated the possibility once in fun and in pain, and in a fairly restricted category (though one he could have shared with several contemporaries, Proust, Katherine Mansfield and D.H. Lawrence among them). When he was dying of TB of the larynx he was fetching up a good deal of phlegm. ‘I think,’ he said (and the joke is more poignant for being so physically painful to make), ‘I think I deserve the Nobel Prize for sputum.’ Nothing if not sick, it is a joke that could have been made yesterday.

Dead sixty-odd years, Kafka is still modern and there is much in the present-day world to interest him. These days Kafka would be intrigued by the battery farm and specifically, with an interest both morbid and lively, in the device that de-beaks the still-living chickens; in waste-disposal trucks that chew the rubbish before swallowing it; and those dubious restaurants that install for your dining pleasure a tank of doomed trout. As the maître d’ assists the discerning diner in the ceremony of choice, be aware of the waiter who wields the net: both mourner and executioner, he is Kafka. He notes old people in Zimmer frames stood in their portable dock on perambulatory trial for their lives. He is interested in the feelings of the squash ball and the champagne bottle that launches the ship. In a football match his sympathy is not with either of the teams but with the ball or, in a match ending nil-nil, with the hunger of the goalmouth... he would be concerned with the current debate on the disposal of nuclear waste. To be placed in a lead canister which is then encased in concrete and sunk fathoms deep to the floor of the ocean was the degree of circulation he thought appropriate for most of his writing. Or not, of course...

Had Kafka the father emigrated to America as so many of his contemporaries did, things might have turned out differently for Kafka the son. He was always stage-struck. Happily lugubrious, he might have turned out a stand-up Jewish comic. Kafka at Las Vegas.

Why didn’t Kafka stutter? The bullying father, the nervous son – life in the Kafka household seems a blueprint for a speech impediment. In a sense, of course, he did stutter. Jerky, extruded with great force and the product of tremendous effort, everything Kafka wrote is a kind of stutter. Stutterers devise elaborate routines to avoid or to ambush and take by surprise troublesome consonants, of which K is one of the most difficult. It’s a good job Kafka didn’t stutter. With two Ks he might have got started on his name and never seen the end of it. As it is, he docks it, curtails it, leaves its end behind much as lizards do when something gets hold of their tail.

...Hermann Kafka has had such a consistently bad press that it’s hard not to feel a sneaking sympathy for him as for all the Parents of Art. They never get it right. They bring up a child badly and he turns out a writer, posterity never forgives them – though without that unfortunate upbringing the writer might never have written a word. They bring up a child well and he never does write a word. Do it right and posterity never hears about the parents: do it wrong and posterity never hears about anything else.

You do not necessarily need to read Kafka's Dick after reading that.

Christopher Hitchens (2010)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2016<br>
<br>
Stylish and consequential. He spread word of some of the most terrible injustices of his day; was arrested by several authoritarian regimes for it; he wrote three original, important books (on Teresa, Kissinger and Orwell); he had a lot of fun. That's a good life. Why, then, are we so uneasy? Because of his changing his mind so forcefully about revolution? About America? Because his direct, tactless opposition to conservative Islam sounds vaguely similar to that of contemporary racists? Because he <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/that-time-margaret-thatcher-spanked-christopher-hitchens/274779/">found Thatcher sexy</a>?

He raised my estimation of the British 'International Socialists' (i.e. Trots) of the 1960s by a giant interval: though nearly powerless and outnumbered on all sides, they really did resist both the US and Soviet empires and the humourlessness and cultishness of their peers, and post-modern, <a href="http://afterallitcouldbeworse.blogspot.co.uk/p/the.html">Foucaultian</a> passivity, and really did manage to help in undramatic ways (fundraising, letter-writing, war tourism). Bravura. 

How did he get from there to chilling with Wolfowitz? Well, on some points Hitchens didn't change at all; the Left did:

<blockquote>
[In 1968] people began to intone the words “The Personal Is Political”. The instant that I first heard this deadly expression, I knew as one does from the utterance of any sinister bullshit that it was very bad news. From now on, it would be enough to a member of a sex or gender, or epidermal subdivision, or erotic “preference”, to qualify as a revolutionary. In order to begin a speech or ask a question from the floor, all that would be necessary by way of preface would be the words, “Speaking as a…” Then could follow any self-loving description. I will have to say this for the old “hard” Left: we earned our claim to speak and intervene by right of experience and sacrifice and work. It would never have done for any of us to stand up and say that our sex or sexuality or pigmentation of disability were qualifications in themselves. There are many ways of dating the moment where the Left lost or – I would prefer to say – discarded its moral advantage, but this was the first time I was to see the sell-out so cheaply.

the Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwah... was, if I can phrase it like this, a matter of everything I hated versus everything I loved. In the hate column: dictatorship, religion, stupidity, demagogy, censorship, bullying, and intimidation. In the love column: literature, irony, humor, the individual, and the defense of free expression... To re-state the premise of the argument again: the theocratic head of a foreign despotism offers money in his own name in order to suborn the murder of a civilian citizen of another country, for the offense of writing a work of fiction. No more root-and-branch challenge to the values of the Enlightenment (on the bicentennial of the fall of the Bastille) or to the First Amendment to the Constitution, could be imagined.

I had become accustomed to the pseudo-Left new style, whereby if your opponent thought he had identified your lowest possible motive, he was quite certain that he had isolated the only real one. This vulgar method, which is now the norm and the standard in much non-Left journalism as well, is designed to have the effect of making any noisy moron into a master analyst.


Today I want to puke when I hear the word 'radical' applied so slothfully and stupidly to Islamist murderers; the most plainly reactionary people in the world.</blockquote>


But never mind that. Lots of gossip, lots of travel writing, lots of quotation from the heart, lots of interesting digressions about the old New Left, nationalisms, Jewishness - have you ever heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskalah">Haskalah</a>? - and two massive eulogies to his dear friends James Fenton and Martin Amis. Everything he said and did from the age of about 18 proceeded from a fully-developed worldview: sarcastic, elevated, British post-Marxist intellectuality.

He becomes the Hitchens you know - the drawling, boozy pal of neocons, more Dawkins than Dawkins is ("Everything about Christianity is contained in the pathetic image of 'the flock'.") - late on in life and even later in the book, so even if you refuse to forgive him his shocking, but internally consistent transformations, it doesn't warp the weft. Beautiful despite crudeness; very modern in several clashing senses.

In one sentence: The establishment's awful, until you get well in it.

<br>
Startling and witty analysis of the language of modern politics:

<blockquote>UNSPEAK - a mode of speech that persuades by stealth, e.g., climate change [rather than global warming], war on terror [rather than war on Afghanistan], ethnic cleansing [rather than genocide], road map [rather than plan], community [rather than 'some self-elected representatives of a supposedly unified group'], 'barrier' [rather than 'wall' or 'checkpoint' or 'annexation'].

With Ben Goldacre, Poole is a model for political writing: eloquent, empirical rage. 

The book's noticeably a product of the time - attacking New Labour and the Bush administration in particular - but its principles transfer.

<br>
Not a sequel: the third act of the first book. A strange mix of very clever and kind of ridiculous. The camp Gothic tone intensifies, piling mystery on the mystical, but eventually resolves in an unexpectedly rosy and metaphysical cadence. But you have to get through 450 pages of sand, impalings, twists, people writing poetry furiously as a walking knife guts them, etc. I'm not sure if it was worth it, but it certainly was Grand.

Ridiculous and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws#Variants_of_the_third_law">Clarke-magic</a>-based sci-fi like Dune, grim and spiked like Blindsight (though turned completely upside down at the end: Watts is a deadly serious treatment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism">epiphenomenalism</a> and illusionism; Simmons' universe is extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism">idealist</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism">dualist</a>), maybe the most extreme I've seen outside of medieval Christians or the hippies.)

Questions which get answered, usually 500 pages in:
* Why is the Shrike such an inefficient avenger?
* Why is John Keats being foregrounded 900 years later as a paragon of humanity? By robots?
* Why are deep ecologists so keen on space?
* What's so bad about the Hegemony?
* Why is there literally no detail about the Ousters?
* Why does Severn keep napping a dozen times a day? (Maybe it's the TB.)
* Why make a copy of Earth? Why preserve it empty?

<spoiler>A reconstructed cyborg Keats is the embodiment of the Human Spirit, able to affect the world (and the plot) as a ghost.</spoiler>

Its appetite for mysticism is surprising. The only super-AI shown in any real detail speaks in koans, and is not especially impressive.
<spoiler>The people who triumph in the end are odd: it's the deep ecologists and kibbutzim and Catholics - the ancient, normalised death cults - who thrive when modernity is withdrawn. The Ousters (and Simmons) equivocate between the Core plotting to murder everyone alive and the Core making everyone too comfortable to innovate and explore space. Which are not really morally equivalent when you think about it.

This is especially odd since the rest of the ending extols our creativity and scepticism and courage, i.e. the Enlightenment.
</spoiler>

The ending is both too neat - all the loose ends tied up, several revivals, the baddies gone without a fight, the missing element in the Grand Unified Theory is the Human Spirit - and surprisingly harsh <spoiler>all the millions dead, and the saviour who rightly killed them torn apart by the mob</spoiler>.

Too long and slow to recommend to everyone, but rich and novel for people who can get past that.

Half the characters in this are ghosts, and one of the less-noted things about ghost stories is that they are wildly optimistic: they tend to show justice prevailing. Yes, fine, the ghost's revenge is a gory, creepy, retributive justice, and a bit late, but it's still the victim's triumph.

The sumtym narayter Bascule makes or breaks the book. He's a good character - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Molesworth">Molesworth</a> on the Web - but I couldn't stand his phonetically told sections when I read this as a teen, and you'll see the reviews below focus on him despite him being only about a quarter of the focalisation. Bad spelling (cognitive dysfunction) is rare in sci-fi - let alone in SF titles - because the authors are trying to be taken seriously to make up for the genre fiction status? - and I've gotten over it since. Maybe better as audiobook. 

The characters are squatting their own civ. What lives on (after a relatively gentle apocalypse) is more self-conscious, historically conscious than that in Book of the New Sun. Not ruined, just forgotten, off the <a href="https://www.nellwatson.com/blog/technological-wavefront">wavefront</a>, using the space elevator as a house. The cyberspace is pretty good (better than Hyperion or Snow Crash or Neuromancer because less neat).

<blockquote>The mist was the world was the data corpus was the Crypto-sphere was the history of the world was the future of the world was the guardian of un-done things was the summation of intel­ligent purpose was chaos was pure thought was the untouched was the utterly corrupted was the end and the beginning was the exiled and the resiled, was the creature and the machine was the life and the inanimate was the evil and the good was the hate and the love was the compassion and the indifference was everything and nothing and nothing and nothing.

One virtuoso passage, on the species' trajectory after a nebula occludes the sun:

<blockquote>so humanity left the surface of the world to the ice, wind and snow, and sheltered, reduced and impoverished, within the stony depths of the planet's skin,  finally coming to resemble nothing more than parasites in the cooling pelt of some huge dying animal.

With it it took all its knowledge of the universe and all the memories of its achievements and all the coded information defining the animals and plants that had survived the vicissitudes of time and evolution and - especially - the pressure of the human species' own until then remorseless rise.

Those buried citadels became whole small worlds of refugee communities and spawned still smaller worlds as new machines took over the job of maintaining the levels of the crypt, until gradually more and more of what was in any sense humanity came to reside not simply in the created world of its tunnels, caverns and shafts but within those worlds in the generated realities produced by its computers...

Still, what was left of humanity persisted, retreating further from the open oven of the surface until it became trapped between it and the heat of the planet's own molten sub-surface.  It was then that the species finally gave up the struggle to remain in macrohuman form, pulling back fully into a virtual environment and resorted to storing its ancient biochemical inheritance as information only, in the hope that one day such fragile concoctions of water and minerals could exist again upon the face of the Earth.

Its time from then was long as people reckoned it from that point, short as they would have before.  The sun's photosphere continued to expand until it swallowed Venus, and Earth did not survive much longer; the last humans on Earth perished together in a crumbling machine core as its cooling circuits failed, the half-finished life-boat spaceship they had been attempting to construct already melted to a hollow husk beside them.

He suffered with each child abandoned to the snow; with every old man or woman left - too exhausted to shiver any more - under piles of ice-hard rags; with all the people swept away by the howling, fire-storm winds; with each consciousness extinguished - its ordered information reduced to random meaninglessness - by the increasing heat.

And he woke from such dreams sometimes wondering whether all that he was being shown could possibly be true, and on other occasions so convinced that it had been real that he would have faithfully believed what he had seen was the inescapable future, rather than some mere possibility, projection or warning.
</blockquote>



Problems: 
* Climaxes about 2/3 through. I suppose that's okay, it's not a three-act play.
* Bascule is hooked into the king's brain surveillance network, but regularly escapes the king's secret police.
* Banks shows the crypt people having <a href="http://ageofem.com/">Em</a> accelerated cognition (about 1000x), but without Ems dominating the economy and society. (Actually, no human besides the military, scientists and secret police are heard of doing any real work, so maybe this is the case in the background.) 
* It's set on Earth, which is odd for Banks, but this fact isn't used much. Some of us stayed behind.
* There are several virtual worlds in this (the bird crypt, the transport map, the interrogation allegories, the deep crypt with its garden) but they're insufficiently different from each other and base reality (all have a kind of fairytale logic, all have mythical beasts stalking around).
* None of the sheer stakes, grandeur, and philosophical tension of the Culture books.
* Fun but a mere sketch.

(e.g. Jeeves responds to highly surprising events by "twitching three hairs of his right eyebrow". It was a screenplay by someone else originally, which might explain its relative lack of subplots and higher-order intentionality.

<blockquote>"Faute de what?" 
"Mieux, m'lord. A French expression. We should say 'For want of anything better.'" 
"What asses these Frenchmen are. Why can't they talk English?" 
"They are possibly more to be pitied than censured, m'lord. Early upbringing no doubt has a lot to do with it."
</blockquote>



It's surely not coincidence that Jeeves' master in this is named Rowcester (pronounced "Rooster").

<blockquote>“Mr Wooster is attending a school which does not permit its student body to employ gentlemen’s personal gentlemen.”
“A school?”
“An institution designed to teach the aristocracy to fend for itself, m’lord. Mr. Wooster feels that it is prudent to build for the future, in case the social revolution should set in with even greater severity. Mr Wooster...

Starts terribly, with a brooding protagonist playing a grand piano outside in a storm. Also, despite being set in 3200CE or whatever, it makes dozens of of leaden references to the culture of C20th Earth. 

But the structure (6 tales from 7 travellers, cf. Chaucer) and the sheer variety of styles and themes soon kicks in and drags you through a delicious cyber-goth intrigue. The poet character is annoying, but he’s meant to be. (The key problem of metafiction: to write a great poet character, you really have to be a great poet yourself. Nabokov was, but even he dodged the issue by making Pale Fire about a flawed poet.) 

At one point it implies that Keats’ poems were retrocaused by schemes of time-travelling AIs, which is a thing I must admire.

Fox draws intense, evil significance out of ordinary irritations (a cat bite, a&nbsp;smashed window, a feud at work) -&nbsp;as we do when at our lowest. It's dark without being Gothic; apocalyptic without&nbsp;melodrama; heartbroken without self-pity. On a hospital waiting room:

<blockquote>It was a dead hole, smelling of synthetic leather and disinfectant, both of which odors seemed to emanate from the torn scratched material of the seats that lined the three walls. It smelled of the tobacco ashes which had flooded the two standing metal ashtrays. On the chromium lip of one, a cigar butt gleamed wetly like a chewed piece of beef. There was the smell of peanut shells and of the waxy candy wrappers that littered the floor, the smell of old newspapers, dry, inky, smothering and faintly like a urinal, the smell of sweat from armpits and groins and backs and faces, pouring out and drying up in the lifeless air, the smell of clothes... a bouquet of animal being, flowing out, drying up, but leaving a peculiar and ineradicable odor of despair in the room as though chemistry was transformed into spirit, an ascension of a kind...</blockquote>

 
The quiet, careful way that&nbsp;every character&nbsp;is sketched&nbsp;in their paranoia is convincing, and unnerving.&nbsp;Sure, it's about upper-middle class people's pain, but that's still pain. The least tractable kind, in fact.

Scott reuses certain idiosyncratic, ear-worm words – “illimitable”, “aviary” as an adjective for a woman – to good effect.

<blockquote>“She’s English.” I said. Alastair made a Scotch noise in the back of his throat.</blockquote>

 
Annoyed at the conclusion – it’s an Oxfordian twist that I resent. But the details make it – rationing, the Scotch cringe, the good and miserable wages of sin.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17122950)">"Heretics: Adventures With The Enemies Of Science"</a></h3>

Will Storr (2013)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2018<br>
<br>
Irritating but righteous. Not quite what it looks like: another <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/apr/07/society">Ronson</a>-<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Call-Weird-Travels-American-Subcultures/dp/0330435701">Theroux</a> journalist, accosting another set of tragicomic kooks). 

OK, it is that, but it's also a grim reflection on how confusing and muddy the world is, on the universality of extreme bias - plus dollops of Storr's personal traumas and peccadilloes. (Half the book is his confessing to childhood theft, psychosis, academic failure, and petty vendettas.) Rather than getting to the bottom of ESP, or morgellons, or homeopathy, or past-life regression, Storr tries to understand the character of the people who believe and disbelieve in them.

Besides confronting unusual beliefs without (as much) prejudice, The Heretics is about coming to terms with the fact that we are all riddled with deep obstacles to objectivity: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups">ingroupism</a> and confirmation bias; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_and_indirect_realism">representation realism</a>; emotional reasoning; the terrifyingly unreliable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_memory">reconstructive</a> nature of memory; the sad <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rationality-versus-intelligence?barrier=accessreg">nonidentity of intelligence and rationality</a>; evolutionarily adaptive delusions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias">superiority</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089.2016.1219030">agency</a>. These are illustrated by interviews with a <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/John_Mackay">creationist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Sheldrake">Sheldrake</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving">Irving</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramdev">Ramdev</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Monckton,_3rd_Viscount_Monckton_of_Brenchley">Monckton</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgellons">Morgellons</a> victims*, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi">Randi</a>.

<blockquote>
Stories work against truth. They operate with the machinery of prejudice and distortion. Their purpose is not fact but propaganda. The scientific method is the tool that humans have developed to break the dominion of the narrative. It has been designed specifically to dissolve anecdote, to strip out emotion and leave only unpolluted data. It is a new kind of language, a modern sorcery, and it has gifted our species incredible powers. We can eradicate plagues, extend our lives by decades, build rockets and fly through space. But we can hardly be surprised if some feel an instinctive hostility towards it, for it is fundamentally inhuman.
</blockquote>


Storr is seriously out of his depth on the science: he is always at least second-hand from the evidence (when interviewing researchers), and often third-hand (most of his citations are pop science books), and so several chapters suffer from journalism's classic problem, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ">false balance</a>. The reason this isn't a call to shut the book is because he doesn't spare himself, states this repeatedly - and this is in fact the theme of his book: that almost all of us are unable to infer the truth about a shocking diversity of things.*

For instance, not just the past-life cranks, but also the Skeptics he encounters are out of their depth, and deserve the calling-out they get from him. No one can think they're past the need for doubt.

<blockquote>I am surprised, for a start, that so few of these disciples of empirical evidence seem to be familiar with the scientific literature on the subject that impassions them so. I am suspicious, too, about the real source of their rage. If they are motivated, as they frequently insist, by altruistic concern over the dangers of supernatural belief, why don't they obsess over jihadist Muslims, homophobic Christians or racist Jewish settlers? Why this focus on stage psychics, ghosthunters and alt-med hippies?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>During our conversation, I asked Randi if he has ever, in his life, changed his position on anything due to an examination of the evidence. After a long silence, he said, 'That's a good question. I have had a few surprises along the way that got my attention rather sharply.' 
&nbsp; 'What were these?' I asked. 
He thought again, for some time. 'Oh, some magic trick that I decided on the modus operandi.'...
'So you’ve never been wrong about anything significant?'
'In regard to the Skeptical movement and my work...' There was another stretched and chewing pause. He conferred with his partner, to see if he had any ideas. 'No. Nothing occurs to me at the moment.'
</blockquote>


That's not how memory works though, is it? 

Even given his unusual humility, Storr is too literal-minded and prosecutorial ("I have been looking for evidence that James Randi is a liar"). Storr is disillusioned with particular Skeptics, and reacts by throwing out scepticism:

<blockquote> For many Skeptics, evidence-based truth has been sacralised. It has caused them to become irrational in their judgements of the motives of those with whom they do not agree...
This monoculture we would have, if the hard rationalists had their way, would be a deathly thing. So bring on the psychics, bring on the alien abductees, bring on the two John Lennons – bring on a hundred of them. Christians or no, there will be tribalism. Televangelists or no, there will be scoundrels. It is not religion or fake mystics that create these problems, it is being human. Where there is illegality or racial hatred, call the police. Where there is psychosis, call Professor Richard Bentall. Where there is misinformation, bring learning. But where there is just ordinary madness, we should celebrate. Eccentricity is our gift to one another. It is the riches of our species. To be mistaken is not a sin. Wrongness is a human right.
</blockquote>


And when Randi corrects himself in the course of a sentence ("I didn't go to grade school at all, I went to the first few grades of grade school"), Storr leaps on this as a serious contradiction rather than just the patchy nature of speech. Sure, he talks about his emotional bias against scepticism - but he still leaves in this idiot journo behaviour, the uncharitable coaxing out of flaws.

These chapters were a good ethnography of '<a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Traditional_rationality">traditional</a>' <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WeQv9LSCj9nYXoTwJ/what-is-wrong-with-traditional-rationality">(nontechnical) rationality</a>. But Storr doesn't know about the other kind (which both foregrounds and copes with all the cognitive biases he is so struck and scarred by), and so his conclusion about rationalism is completely awry.**

The title is fitting in a few ways: Storr sees these people as persecuted underdogs (he likes many of the quacks and fringeists, and so focusses on the arrogance and bias of the - however correct - mainstream figures dealing with them); and they certainly have the holy madness of people who cry out despite knowing they will be ostracised.

<blockquote>Over the last few months, John E Mack has become a kind of hero to me. Despite his earlier caution, he ended up believing in amazing things: intergalactic space travel and terrifying encounters in alien craft that travelled seamlessly through nonphysical dimensions. And when his bosses tried to silence him, he hired a lawyer. He fought back against the dean and his dreary minions. He battled hard in the name of craziness...
</blockquote>


David Irving is interesting in this regard: he does not act like a fraud (e.g. he sues people for libel, even though this brings intensive scrutiny of his research), but rather a sort of compulsive masochist-contrarian. Stranger still, his (beloved) family were all solid anti-Nazi soldiers in WWII. (Storr contorts himself to explain Irving's identification with Hitler as due to their sharing an admiration of the British forces (...)) 

Storr's awful experience on a Vipassana retreat is a vivid example of the Buddhist <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/the-dark-knight-of-the-souls/372766/">dark night of the soul</a>. We don't know what fraction of people suffer terribly from meditation, but despite its <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/23/1064082990875.html">cuddly image</a>, there's surely large overlap with the <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254610/WHO-MSD-MER-2017.2-eng.pdf;jsessionid=C7A88D6AF4B91BEB0EBF7EA1A65E2671?sequence=1">8% of people</a> who are clinically depressive and/or anxious.

The chapter on psi does not represent <a href="http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/2011/WagenmakersEtAl2011_JPSP.pdf">the state</a> <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033423">of evidence</a> <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/01/06/that_silly_esp/">properly</a> - perhaps because one of his proof-readers was <a href="https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/06/daryl-bem-proved-esp-is-real-showed-science-is-broken.html">Professor Daryl Bloody Bem</a>. ***

The ending is stirring but tilts over into relativism:

<blockquote>The Skeptic tells the story of Randi the hero; the psychic of Randi the devil. We all make these unconscious plot decisions...

We are all creatures of illusion. We are made out of stories. From the heretics to the Skeptics, we are all lost in our own secret worlds. 
</blockquote>


But the question is to what degree! And the degree of lostness, of inverse rationality, varies by many orders of whatever magnitude you wish to pick.

Storr's disquiet at the sheer power of cognitive bias, and the systematic failures of yes/no science (that is: statistical significance rather than effect size estimation) is well and good.

<blockquote>I think ‘the probability that a model or a hypothesis is true’ is generally a meaningless statement except as noted in certain narrow albeit important examples.</blockquote>

.) 
And his humane approach is certainly bound to be more compelling to mystics and flakes than e.g. deGrasse Tyson's smug dismissals. But Storr is scared of grey, of the fact that doubt is only reducible and not eliminable. This is because he doesn't know anything about our most beautiful weapons: probabilism, Bayesian inference, Analysis. 

I recommend <a href="http://elephantinthebrain.com/">Elephant in the Brain</a> or <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/">Rationality from A to Z</a> instead as an approach to the vital, dreadful side of cognition (including advice on avoiding being a fake, partial, traditional sceptic); they have less angst and false equivalences, and were written by people who understand the balance of evidence. 

Actually that's too strong; I am frustrated with Storr because he is so similar to me, except he doesn't grasp that the technical is the path out of (many) biases. There's a lot wrong with it and you should probably read it, and how often can one say that?

<br>
* Storr is right that skeptics can lack compassion. The "Morgellons" people are victims regardless of what their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology">etiology</a> turns out to be (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusional_parasitosis">mental illness</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formication">nerve disorders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithonyssus_bacoti">tropical rat mites</a>, or yes malicious sentient fibres). At minimum, they are victims of bad fortune plus rigid and actually unscientific medical practices. The Lesswrong style of rationalist has less of this problem IMO (more emotional literacy; a more Californian culture).

** Storr:

<blockquote>I am concerned that I have overstated my argument. In my haste to write my own coherent story, I have barely acknowledged the obvious truth that minds do sometimes change. People find faith and they lose it. Mystics become Skeptics. Politicians cross the floor. I wonder why this happens. Is it when the reality of what is actually happening in our lives overpowers the myth that we make of themselves? Are we simply pursuing ever more glorious hero missions?...

This is an imperfect system, as it relies on many secondary sources. Moreover, I do not declare myself to be free of the biases that afflict any writer, and I'm certainly not immune to making mistakes. If any errors are noted, or if new findings supersede claims made in the text, I would be very grateful to receive notification via willstorr.com, so future editions can be corrected.

*** Important caveat to the headline of that linked article from Gelman:

<blockquote>
The only thing I don’t like about Engber’s article is its title, “Daryl Bem Proved ESP Is Real. Which means science is broken.” I understand that “Daryl Bem Proved ESP Is Real” is kind of a joke, but to me this is a bit too close to the original reporting on Bem, back in 2011, where people kept saying that Bem’s study was high quality, state-of-the-art psychology, etc. Actually, Bem’s study was crap. It’s every much as bad as the famously bad papers on beauty and sex ratio, ovulation on voting, elderly-related words and slow walking, etc.

And “science” is not broken. Crappy science is broken. Good science is fine. If “science” is defined as bad articles published in PPNAS—himmicanes, air rage, ages ending in 9, etc.—then, sure, science is broken. But if science is defined as the real stuff, then, no, it’s not broken at all.

<br>
Picked this up looking for a laugh, so my god. Of sordid, heartbroken, soft totalitarianism. The ineliminable danger of being different, and the specific danger for one difference in particular. A companion piece to The Book of Dave, underneath Britain's (and humanity's) downside. 

: Britain insulates itself against a self-inflicted atrocity by pushing away history and strongly banning modernist or pessimist ideas and people. So many despicable characters, like the art professor who defines everything by how little it reflects darkness or human brutality, 'primitivism' and 'degeneracy' (the irony being that this attitude, of art as mere grinning decoration, is itself a backslide from modernism, however empty and stupid much conceptual art is).

<blockquote>There was something uncanny about her, the seriousness with which she took her work, her obduracy, the size of her vocabulary, the lack of bounce in her hair, the flat shoes she wore, her failure often to get a joke, her way of overdoing sympathy as as though understanding beat snogging.</blockquote>


The book (if not Jacobson) has a terrifying attitude towards bigotry: that it's never going away because it based on the deep need of exclusive identity, that bad marriages and ethnic atrocities appeal to something much deeper and more formal than what happens to have been socialised into us. 'Necessary Opposites', as he puts it:

<blockquote>'...Identity is nothing but illusion.'
'If it's all illusion, why has it caused so much misery?'
... 
'Only when we have a different state to strive against do we have reason to strive at all. And different people the same. I am me because I am not her, or you. If we were all red earthworms there'd be no point in life. Identity is just the name we give to making ourselves distinct.'
'So you're saying it's irrelevant what our identities really are? As long as we assume one and fight against someone else's.'
'I'd say so, yes. Pretty much.'
'Isn't that a bit arbitrary?'
'Perhaps. But isn't everything? There's no design.' </blockquote>

<br>
A pinnacle of style. He lays it out and winds it up within about 90 pages, then drawls out a subplot over the last 40. One reason it's still so fresh is the understatement. The "fuck"s are all em-dashed out, and basically everybody is constantly dry and laconic with each other, Marlowe most of all of course. In fact it's notable when one character is inarticulate ("Carol Lundgren, the boy killer with the limited vocabulary...")

<blockquote>"Sit down next to him," Brady snapped. "Hold it on him low down, away from the door..."
She came over and sat next to me on the davenport and pointed the gun at my leg artery. I didn't like the jerky look in her eyes.</blockquote>


("Leg artery")

It wears noir's obligatory cynicism lightly:

<blockquote>"I'm a copper," he said, "a plain ordinary copper. Reasonably honest. As honest as you could expect a man to be in a world where it's out of style."</blockquote>



<blockquote>Being a copper I like to see the law win. I'd like to see the flashy well-dressed mugs like Eddie Mars spoiling their manicures in the rock quarry at Folsom, alongside of the poor little slum-bred guys that got knocked over on their first caper and never had a break since. [But] We just don't run our country that way.</blockquote>


Constantly balances concision and winning detail, e.g:

<blockquote>"Ohls growled and turned to me, his eyebrows bristling. «You're on the air, Marlowe. Give it to him."
I gave it to him.
I left out two things, not knowing just why, at the moment, I left out one of them. I left out Carmen's visit to Brody's apartment and Eddie Mars' visit to Geiger's in the afternoon. I told the rest of it just as it happened.
Cronjager never took his eyes off my face and no expression of any kind crossed his as I talked. At the end of it he was perfectly silent for a long minute. Wilde was silent, sipping his coffee, puffing gently at his dappled cigar. Ohls stared at one of his thumbs.
Cronjager leaned slowly back in his chair and crossed one ankle over his knee and rubbed the ankle bone with his thin nervous hand.</blockquote>


Its homophobia is what dates it, with very contemporaneous nonsensical stuff like:

<blockquote>I still held the automatic more or less pointed at him, but he swung on me just the same. It caught me flush on the chin. I backstepped fast enough to keep from falling, but I took plenty of the punch. It was meant to be a hard one, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Cruz">a pansy</a> has no iron in his bones, whatever he looks like.</blockquote>

<br>
Heavy-handed metaphysical mystery (: there is another world - economic world, national world - visible but the vision suppressed). His usual incandescence is present, but under a shade: the prose is conventional, with spectacular Miévillian words like ‘topolganger’ (an identical-but-Other place) popping up only twice a chapter, rather than twice a page. Similarly scarce are his characteristic use of detail – protagonist Borlu is in an open relationship with a woman identified only as an economic historian. 

Hints of The Matrix’s ontological sensationalism and noir’s worn-out idioms, but it works because Mieville’s good enough (with ontology, but also generally) to redeem clichés. tC&tC twists repeatedly without losing credibility; the Cities’ omnimalevolent atmospheres make great noir. There’s even a rooftop showdown. An unfair consequence of extreme talent is that your ‘merely’ interesting, well-constructed books are marked down, judged by ghostly expectations.

<blockquote>
A year or so later, the polite cosmologist had been murdered by Algerian religious fundamentalists who thought his account of the universe a blasphemy against the words of the prophet Yusuf Smith as inscribed on his tablets of gold...

Somewhere along the line she, too, had changed. She’d spent decades— the best part of her second life —fighting nuclear proliferation. Starting out as a dreadlocked direct-action activist, chaining herself to fences, secure in the naive youthful belief that no harm could befall her. Later, she figured out that the way to do it was wearing a smart suit, with mercenary soldiers and the threat of canceled insurance policies backing up her quiet voice. Still prickly and direct, but less of a knee-jerk nonconformist, she’d learned to work the system for maximum effect. The hydra seemed halfway under control, bombings down to only one every couple of years, when Bertil had summoned her to Geneva and offered her a new job. Then she’d wished she’d paid more attention to the cosmologist—for the Algerian Latter-Day Saints had been very thorough in their suppression of the Tiplerite heresy-but it was too late, and in any event, the minutiae of the Standing Committee’s investigations into chronological and probabilistic warfare beckoned...

She’d done her share of shooting, too, or at least directing the machinery of preemptive vengeance, wiping out more than one cell of atomic-empowered fanatics—whether central-Asian independence fighters, freelance meres with a bomb too many in their basement, or on one notable occasion, radical pro-lifers willing to go to any lengths to protect the unborn child. Idealism couldn’t coexist with so many other people’s ideals, betrayed in their execution by the tools they’d chosen. She’d walked through Manchester three days after the Inter-City Firm’s final kickoff, before the rain had swept the sad mounds of cinders and bone from the blasted streets.

<br>
As a student I was much vexed by analytic philosophy. This was partially sour grapes (because I didn't know enough maths to keep up with some of it), but also partially fair: it isn't what it says it is. Roughly: modern, modest, science-friendly clarification.) 

Preston's polemic is that analytic philosophy isn't real and never was, in the sense that it isn't actually a school, a set of views, or even a methodology. (Instead it's a Anglophone social clique.) The nominally distinctive part of it was, according to Preston, the linguistic thesis: that "philosophy is wholly or largely a matter of linguistic analysis." While some analytics in the canon did think this, most don't and never did. This is dodgy.

John Wisdom is quoted saying that what analytics have in common is their seeking "new insight into old truths". Amazingly, that seems about right, and in the plainest possible terms.

Exciting but excessive.

Too full of infodumps and too circuitous to reach his personal best (which I would say is the genre's personal best): it lacks the grander metaphysical framework of the Culture books, which handle civilization at the limit - where philosophy is at last unavoidable because practical matters have been solved and tucked away. It does have a right good baddie - a calm galactic overlord driven to be demonic and obscene for PR reasons. But the protagonist, a thoughtful manipulated academic, isn't interesting. I missed the book's grand conceit the first time I read this: the MacGuffin that drives everything is an epic, lost book called the The Algebraist, described only as being:

<blockquote>
all about mathematics, navigation as a metaphor, duty, love, longing, honour, long voyages home... All that stuff.</blockquote>

Quite lyrical but exhausting. All the way from Galen to personal oncogenetics.

The section on pre-anesthesia radical surgery was truly nauseating. A horrendous macho fad:

<blockquote>Haagensen wrote in 1956: 'it is my duty to carry out as radical an operation as the... anatomy permits.'

The radical mastectomy had... edged into the “ultraradical,” an extraordinarily morbid, disfiguring procedure in which surgeons removed the breast, the pectoral muscles, the axillary nodes, the chest wall, and occasionally the ribs, parts of the sternum, the clavicle, and the lymph nodes inside the chest.

Breast cancer, [Halsted] claimed, spun out from the breast into the lymph nodes under the arm, then cartwheeled mirthlessly through the blood into the liver, lungs, and bones. A surgeon’s job was to arrest that centrifugal spread by cutting every piece of it out of the body, as if to catch and break the wheel in midspin. This meant treating early breast cancer aggressively and definitively. The more a surgeon cut, the more he cured.</blockquote>



The sheer amount of money and genius thrown at cancer - <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/01/cancer-progress-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">with merely gradual returns</a> - is not really considered in terms of its opportunity cost, by Mukherjee of anyone - what diseases might we have cured with those hundreds of billions? What giant, clever prevention studies run? But never mind: cancer won the PR war (against apathy, against political indifference, against more cost-effective causes) very early on, with the chemo pioneer Farber and his use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jimmy_Fund">Jimmy</a>

<blockquote>The campaign against cancer, Farber learned, was much like a political campaign: it needed icons, mascots, images, slogans—the strategies of advertising as much as the tools of science. For any illness to rise to political prominence, it needed to be marketed, just as a political campaign needed marketing. A disease needed to be transformed politically before it could be transformed scientifically.

Cool blast through three-and-a-bit millennia of talk of Christ’s bowels and fucking shit. She distinguishes between ‘obscenities’ and ‘oaths’ (the first takes profane subjects, the second sacred) and then between the proper and the vain oath (e.g. “Bejasus! Godammit! Hell’s teeth!”). 

Adding the generalisation that ‘we swear about what we care about’, she can use known changes in the expressive power of swearwords to cleverly trace the movement of taboos across cultures and over time. (Very broadly: power went from Shit’s precedence to Holy and now back and with more political terms.) Rome’s nasty little sexuality is seen to be the model of a lot of our crap associations; in the Middle Ages vain oaths were criminal while scholars and physicians used ‘cunt’ in textbooks without heat. 

In our time, racial slurs (very young as slurs – only around WWII for their worst malevolence) have taken the biscuit from sex, excrement and God - which you can see as encouraging (if that means we now care about the targets of racial language) - or depressing (if that means we now care more about Race, dividing lines for their own sake). 

Mohr is full of fact without being trivial; she lets graffiti, court records, and primary quotation damn the damnable – e.g. DH Lawrence’s holy cock-mysticism, the spume of Twitter bigots.

<br>
Descartes teaches lots of things, but the most relevant is the terrible power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning">motivated reasoning</a> to pervert someone - even if the reasoner is hugely intelligent. 

But not only. Catherine Wilson forced me to think of Descartes as more than a strong mathematician, incomplete scientist, bigoted apriorist and shoddy Analytic. Not least, she wrote <a href="http://www.philosophica.ugent.be/fulltexts/76-4.pdf">this</a>, maybe the brassiest passage I've ever seen in an academic journal:

<blockquote>if Descartes had written a Preface to the Meditations that was truthful, faithful to his firmest convictions, and philosophically consistent, the relevant section would have gone something like this:

<blockquote>
I cannot demonstrate the immortality of the human soul, and probably no philosopher can. Immortality is not logically impossible, but it wouldn’t be what you are probably imagining it to be either. Perception, like sensation and emotion, is a registering by our minds of occurrences in our nerves and brain. If our minds endure after death, therefore, as far as the philosopher can tell, they will feel neither pain, nor pleasure, for they will no longerform a composite with our bodies. We will no longer see colours, touch objects, and hear sounds. We will not remember events ofour past lives. We will be numb and inert. Animals will be, as both Aristotle and Lucretius thought, nothing after death, and wehumans will be almost nothing - at most capable of imageless thought and intellectual memory. Of course, we can hope for more than this. Perhaps our bodies will be resurrected and reattached to our minds, so that we are restored to awareness of a world. But this is a matter of faith and cannot be philosophically demonstrated, whereas more important truths such as the excellence of our minds and bodies can be philosophically demonstrated. 

Be that as it may, we are not mere animals. Our language and rationality indicate that we are specially favoured by God. As to whether animals are conscious, I do not know. I avoid speculative philosophy. But everyone can appreciate that animalscannot carry on a conversation, and I seriously doubt that animals reason, for I can show how their behaviour is mediated by the brain to which their sensory organs report, without ascribing reasoning to them. 

The Fathers of the Church were wrong to scorn the human body asa source of moral corruption and to suggest that it is a shell that we will happily cast off.

<br>
A dizzying parade of names, about three-quarters of which I'd never heard of. Completely idiosyncratic - for instance he doesn't rate the Beatles at all - but absolutely consistent and catholic.

One of his principles: He maintains an art vs pop distinction I don't agree with anymore:

<blockquote>fundamentally, being an art musician is a different kind of job... than the job of popular entertainer. The art musician is pursuing a research program that will be appreciated mainly by his peers and by the “critics” (functioning as historians of music), not by the public... The goal of an art musician is, first and foremost, to do what s/he feels is important... 

Art music knows no stylistic boundaries: the division in classical, jazz, rock, hip hop and so forth still makes sense for commercial music (it basically identifies the sales channel) but ever less sense for art music whose production, distribution and appreciation methods are roughly the same, regardless of whether the musician studied in a Conservatory, practiced in a loft or recorded at home with a laptop. </blockquote>


He is willing to forgive incompetence, contempt and if only there is a cup of originality in it.

This is really a stand-in for <a href="http://www.scaruffi.com/music.html">his website</a>, which is an astonishing, rambling, deep testament to him, on history, neuroscience, AI, poetry, politics and whatever. I hope I leave behind something nearly as towering and distinctive.

<br>
Updikean satire, more delightful than funny. Its surrealism, puns (Mrs Risenshein, an LOL in NAD [litle old lady in no obvious distress]), sexual glibness earn it a right to sentimentality in the face of human filth and pain:
<blockquote>
We fought. She probably knew we were fighting about Dr. Sanders’s long dying and about the illusion in my father’s letters and about my plethora of absent role models and the blossoming idea that the gomers were not our patients but our adversaries, and most of all we were fighting over the guilt that I felt for having Molly in a dark corner of the ward standing up, this Molly, who, like me, wouldn’t stop and think and feel either, because if she ruminated on what she felt about enemas and emesis basins, she’d lose faith even in her centipede and want to kill herself too. Our fight was not the violent, howling, barking fight that keeps alive vestiges of love, but that tired, distant, silent fight where the fighters are afraid to punch for fear the punch will kill. So this is it, I thought dully, four months into the internship and I’ve become an animal, a mossbrained moose who did not and could not and would not think and talk, and it’s come like an exhausted cancerous animal to my always love, my buddy Berry, and me–yes it’s come to us: Relationship On Rocks...</i</blockquote>


Shem's dialogue is pleasurable - the Flann O'Joyce variety of brainy silliness. His two eloquent Irish cops are the best people in the book:

<blockquote>"Top o' the morning to you, brave Sergeant Finton Gilheeney."
"Is it the Commissioner?"
"None other. The young doctor says that with the aid of an operation, with the usefulness of the scalpel being demonstrated, you will survive." 
"-Dr Basch, I believe that I now have no need of the last rites. If so, could the priest depart? He scares me in the memory of how close to heaven or that hot other place I came."
"-And is there a message for the little woman, the wife?" the Commissioner asked as the priest left...
"Ah well, all the best boyo, and I'm on my way to your wife and will soothe her with my boyish good looks and TV-cop mien. Good-bye, and for the young scholar here who saved your fine red life, SHALOM and God bless."
Savage, all of it, savage.</blockquote>


Like any psychologically ambitious work of the mid-C20th, it has a lot of Freud in it, much of it going unchallenged. The book is also about the distress and pain of an extremely lucky and insulated and remunerated man surrounded by women who do massive amounts for him, but you mostly forget this, it is that good. 

I imagine there are still pockets of people out there who still believe in the 1950s George Clooney heroism and omnicompetence of doctors.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6691)">"My Uncle Oswald"</a></h3>

Roald Dahl (1986)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Mar 2013<br>
<br>
Comic novella about raping famous men for money. So, one of the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction#Timeline">real person slashfics</a> in history. Actually scandalous; one can only imagine the ruckus if it was published today.

The eponymous rogue teams up with a livestock scientist and a beautiful accomplice ("Yasmin Howcomely, a girl absolutely soaked in sex") to date-rape the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Uncle_Oswald#Victims_of_Oswald.27s_plot_.28in_order_of_appearance_in_the_book.29">great men</a> of early C20th Europe. Then blackmail them, and steal their semen to sell off. Drugging Freud, Monet and Proust with a psychotic aphrodisiac, the three conspirators collect a Nobel sperm bank. Most of the men are disposed of in one pithy paragraph, with only comic details supplied. 

It's scandalous because of its levity. The plot has more in common with <em>A Serbian Film </em>than <em>Carry On</em>, yet it keeps up the latter's matey banter. At one point Yasmin comes across Picasso, who promptly rapes and dismisses her, without need of the "Sudanese blister beetle" drug. Needless to say, this is tremendous sport:

<blockquote>"Do you know what he did afterwards?" Yasmin said. "He just buttoned up his trousers and said, ‘Thank you, mademoiselle. That was very refreshing. Now I must get back to my work.’ And he turned away, Oswald! He just turned away and started painting again!"
"He’s Spanish," I said, "like Alfonso." I stepped out of the car and cranked the starting handle and when I got back in again, Yasmin was tidying her hair in the car mirror. 
"I hate to say it,” she said, "but I rather enjoyed that one."
"Tell me," I said, "is Monsieur Picasso a genius?"
"Yes," she said, "it was very strong. He shall be wildly famous one day."
</blockquote>



The sexual prowess of the drugged men is a means for Oswald to reflect on their overall quality. (The volume they produce is shorthand for his esteem of them, e.g.: "Fifty straws from Kipling.") It leaves Dahl room to propound a general ranking of the giant personalities of the eC20th. For instance, Einstein and Freud are able to resist their inverted rape for some minutes, earning both respect and suspicion. And of Freud:

<blockquote>"You should have seen his face, Oswald. You really should have seen it. The Beetle was hitting him and the sexcrazy glint was coming into h</span></span><span style="color: #783f04; font-family: inherit;">is eyes and he was beginning to flap his arms like an old crow. But I’ll say this for him. He didn’t jump me right away. He held off for at least a minute or so while he tried to analyze what the hell was happening. He looked down at his trousers. Then he looked up at me... He was really very decent about it all. As soon as he’d had his first explosion... he jumped away and ran back to his desk stark naked and began writing notes. He must be terrifically strong-minded. Great intellectual curiosity."
</blockquote>



The low point comes in the treatment of Shaw, by this stage a celibate disabled old man. They drug him three times the dose and:

<blockquote>"Who is there?" shouted a voice from behind the hut. It was a male voice, but high-pitched and almost squeaky. Oh God, I though, the man is a eunuch after all...

[after]... I heard a yell from the garden and in the half-darkness I saw this tall, ghostlike, whitebearded figure charging down upon us stark naked and yelling, "Come back, you strumpet! I haven’t finished with you yet!"

I saw Mr. Shaw capering about on the sidewalk under the gaslight, white-skinned all over save for a pair of socks on his feet, bearded above and bearded below as well, with his massive pink member protruding like a sawn-off shotgun from the lower beard. It was a sight I shall not readily forget, this mighty and supercilious playwright who had always mocked the passions of the flesh, himself impaled now upon the sword of lust</span>..."
</blockquote>



He is made into a real man - no more humourless vegetarian prude. Sad and standard in "one of [Dahl's] lightest comic works".

Oswald is not Dahl; some of Oswald's opinions of his victims are cartoonishly snobbish; its <a href="https://readysteadyno.blogspot.com/2010/02/propos-of-lady-chatterleys-lover-dh.html">idiotic, Lawrentian theory</a> of virility is only used because it is very funny; and Oswald receives a brutal comeuppance for exploiting Yasmin that it's implied he never recovers from. 

A dazzling and ridiculous book, and as far as I can tell it evaded all opprobrium because it was published in the gap between the sexual revolution and the rise of PC. From the above you already know if you should avoid it.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89187)">"Revelation Space (Revelation Space, #1)"</a></h3>

Alastair Reynolds (2002)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2016<br>
<br>
Sorta sterile prose but still very readable goth space opera. Simmonsian - "Stoners" and "shrouders". Herbertian atavism and castes. Shadowplay is good. Ideas are good - but I compare everyone's ideas to Banks and Stross. POV switches way too frequently - sometimes on every other page. This produces glibness. The narrative takes a series of 10 year slips, or 22 year slips, between scenes, which produces agreeable disorientation. Absolutely incredible denouement, best in recent memory.


How does it do as Serious science fiction?

Social development: Notable because of its lack of play with human nature: Reynolds' people - no matter how bionic or brainwashed by aliens - are just us in a weird setting. Also the same politics and same weapons. The aliens are properly alien, though. 

Software development: None I can remember.

 Actual Science: Not its game.

Ann Leckie (2013)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2018<br>
<br>
Extremely similar to Left Hand of Darkness: undidactic gender-bending, bonding on an ice world, the grey realpolitik of empires, cultural interpenetration, high variance in tech levels.

Leckie's world has a lot of detail but she mostly manages to avoid this kind of opaque sentence:

<blockquote>On Shis'urna, in Ors, the Justice of Ente Seven Issa who had accompanied Lieutenant Skaaiat to Jen Shinnan's sat with me in the lower level of the house.</blockquote>



Best bit is the implications of high-tech dictatorship: the dark emperor has surveillance footage of everything within their domain, and thousands of clones of themself, and can edit memories, etc. This makes for extreme stability.

(The bit that reassured me, early on, that this wasn't going to be irksome is that the Terrible Galactic Imperialists are the ones with the post-gender society.)

The politics aren't that prominent; the quest looms larger. There is this section, which doesn't manage to be <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7443812-the-fact-is-that-civilisation-requires-slaves-the-greeks-were">as thoughtful as Oscar Wilde in 1891</a>:

<blockquote>here's the truth: luxury always comes at someone else's expense. One of the many advantages of civilization is that one doesn't generally have to see that, if one doesn't wish. You're free to enjoy its benefits without troubling your conscience.
</blockquote>



That seems to be true of her imperialists, the Radch. But why? They have extremely competent superhuman AIs, like the protagonist, but for some reason their economy is still scarce and material.

The protagonist One Esk is quite good; think Commander Data plus an oath of vengeance. The superior force serving a blithe master: I'm actually reminded of Jeeves (high praise). That said, the morality of her vengeance quest is dubious: she knows she's setting off a galactic civil war and doesn't even think her assassination will accomplish anything. Maybe the next book will do a Dune Messiah and turn the triumph of this book to ashes and despair.

Jaan Kross (2003)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2017<br>
<br>
Pleasant, mostly fabricated historical novel about an obscure Estonian nobleman who sent his friend Czar Alexander a draft constitution which ended the absolute monarchy, and inherited titles, and removed the Czar from military command, and gave out universal education and the franchise, and who got what you'd expect in return. All the events come to us filtered through a ignoble narrator representing the standard 'enlightened' view of the time: sure the Romanovs are evil, but for God's sake don't say so. 

Lots to admire, in the slow, tense pace - nothing really happens in the present, it's all uncovered in letters - or in his handling of Timo's idealism/insanity. This prison scene made me laugh, on the tube:

<blockquote>'Timo - are you really sure it was the Czar?'
"I wasn't sure at first. He was wearing a short black cloak with a hood covering his head. I couldn't open my eyes and look straight at him, because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Then I recognized him with certainty, in the light... he stepped back from my cot, and – just imagine this! – knelt down on the floor that was covered with rat droppings – I watched him through my eyelashes – and began to pray – two feet away from my ear! I could hear every word he whispered: 

'... I beseech Thee, Lord, make him see reason and make him apologize to his Sovereign for his unimaginable words — so that I might forgive him and become free of the burden it is to me to keep him im­prisoned...’ He closed his eyes and said, as if to himself: ‘But if Thou hast decided otherwise, I say like Thy son said to Thee at Gethsemane: Father, I pray to Thee — but let Thy will be done, not mine. ’ And then, Jakob — then he lowered his head and opened his eyes, and looked straight into mine...
“Well. Two words was all we exchanged. He whispered:
'...Timothee?!'
And I said, 'Tartuffe!'

“He covered his ears with his palms and ran out of the casemate, in rather an unimperial fashion. And I haven’t seen him since.” Timo cleared his throat and added, sounding somewhat self-deprecating: “At least not awake, that is...”
I said, “Timo, this story — surely it was only a dream?”
Timo had walked over to the far corner of the room where the
shadows cast by the sconce mirrors combined to create near­
darkness. He stood there, almost invisible; even the glow of the
pipe he was holding had gone out. Then he laughed and said: 
“Well — whatever you think best... ”
</blockquote>


But Kross is clumsy in inserting an enchanting peasant as Timo's wife; everyone who knows her is a complete Eeva fanboy, rhapsodising. But it's not clear why; she's brave and catty but otherwise pretty indistinct. There's definitely an undercurrent of promoting Estonian accomplishments here - not many of Timo and Eeva's grand and broad virtues are attested in the evidence, which makes them <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary</a> and <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu">Marty</a> Sue in Kross' fanfiction - but it strikes me that this is not just chauvinism, given Kross' context. Consider: an Estonian living under Russian totalitarianism writes about an Estonian speaking out against Russian totalitarianism.

I resent Kross for the M. Night Shymalan ending, a bit, though it is possible that I should be resenting the narrator's fantasies of it instead.

Ivy League Arts boys fail at life, cut coupons, measure themselves ironically against Lenin –

<blockquote>At the same time, Mark had not been with a woman in many months. What would Lenin have done? Lenin would have called Mark’s hesitation a social-democratic scruple. It’s pretty clear what Lenin would have done.</blockquote>

 
- ‘Blech’, I hear you say. But it flows so smoothly that it’s hard to hold its tragic treatment of untragic subjects against it. 

It follows real life quite closely – we see [Al Gore]’s daughter at college, and a cartoon [Chomsky] –<blockquote>Lomaski in his office was sweaty, skinny, ill-preserved, drinking tea after tea so that his teeth seemed to yellow while Sam watched.</blockquote>

 

There are gauche jpegs of Hegel, Lincoln, Gore inserted in the text, in an equivocal Safran Foer way. Meh. 

The women – i.e. the boys’ ideas of the women – are the fixation: they set the structure and timbre and volume of everything else. I think I am hard on it because I might have written it in a different life. Clever, but. (Extra half point for an unclichéd Palestine chapter.)

Hot-footed mystical parable, afloat on a bed of Tao, psychoanalysis, and Nietzsche. Bad guy’s a Grand Unscrupulous Utilitarian: excellent, manipulative, and innocently destructive (Confucius?). Her memorable para-omnipotent protagonist George Orr is put-upon, dismissible, infuriatingly passive (or, rather, wu wei): the Tao. 

Scifi has a lot of conventions which can easily end in literary clumsiness – think contrived alien names, more or less stupid extrapolations from current science, brooding passages about the curst Capitalised Social Change of Twenty-three-dickety-four – but LeGuin, even this early, was in charge of them. Gripping, but top-heavy.

<br>
Grand account of London’s strange socio-emotional contortion up to 2008. When he listed the banker’s sky-high rationalised outgoings (“nanny: £20,000 plus employment tax nonsense”), I thought Capital was going to be didactic; when its first chapters revealed its prose to be a plain story-book, I thought it was going to be pat and mundane. 

Instead it’s humane, deliberate and clear, implying radical critique while focussing on the inside of the matter, flicking between a dozen vivid characters (who collide neatly in the very way of The C21st Novel) and noting the sharp line between the City people and the immigrants who serve them. 

(There’s a sick sharp bit where a pro bono human rights lawyer wants to be begged for their services.) 

Lanchester uses whodunit tension without detracting from his main achievement, which is engrossing ordinariness (traffic wardens and Polish rewiring, infidelious twinges and infant irrationality).

Cynical comedy about the radical hippies. DeLillo on MDMA. 

The narrator is loud (talking to his typewriter and the moon), louder even than say Douglas Adams:

<blockquote>It worked. Mongooses did kill the rats. They also killed chickens, young pigs, birds, cats, dogs, and small children. There have been reports of mongooses attacked motorbikes, power lawn mowers, golf carts, and James Mitchener. Hawaii had traded its rat problem for a mongoose problem...  Society had a crime problem. It hired cops to attack crime. Now society has a cop problem
</blockquote>


While it mocks New Age politics, Robbins still loves an outlaw and a weirdo, and so he takes on their anarchic personal project, to "preserve insanity" and all that.

<blockquote>A better world has gotta start somewhere. Why not with you and me?</blockquote>


Conclusion is funny and irresponsible: when faced with a conflict between social good and romantic individualism (as we all always are), ditch the former.

She waited with longing for a denial. "You are lovely, brilliant, witty", the incredible words which would relieve her of any need to repay him or refuse his gifts; loveliness and wit were priced higher than any gift he offered, while if a girl were loved, even old women of hard experience would admit her right to take and never give. But he denied nothing. His answer was almost insulting in its simplicity.
"I can talk easily to you. I feel I know you." She knew what that meant.

Charles Stross (2008)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Apr 2014<br>
<br>
Morbid, playful. Robots emancipated by our death fall into slaving each other. Stross’ science makes it: he defamiliarises ordinary human conditions (e.g. water is just another arbitrary compound to them, and the emphasis on, well, time that fiction about humans finds it hard to do without is off), he focusses on the many many vagaries of spaceflight (“The dirty truth is that space travel is shit…”), and offers a harsh, clean sociology (“Architecture and economics are the unacknowledged products of planetography”)...
 
Prose is hard to describe: there’s definitely a Douglas Adams twinkle in there, but it’s buried beneath hard science, sexual complexity and glib lifts (“that corner of me which is forever Juliette”). His society’s accidental oligarchy is dissatisfying; the plot’s repetitive and disintegrates towards the end. Still cool, obtrusive.

Richard K. Morgan (2005)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2015<br>
<br>
<a href="//4.bp.blogspot.com/-35sT3bx58zA/Vg5vpURP1pI/AAAAAAAACZU/YR1BVkwS3tI/s1600/480x270x340510.jpg.pagespeed.ic.xDd2H0EnOL.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a></div>

So totally a book of its time: of cinematic Adbustersish rage and paranoia. By 2086, military aid has been fully privatised, making a free market of unilateral political force:

<blockquote>All over the world, men and women still find causes worth killing and dying for. And who are we to argue with them? Have we lived in their circumstances? Have we felt what they feel? No. It is not our place to say if they are right or wrong. At Shorn Conflict Investments, we are concerned with only two things. Will they win? And will it pay?</blockquote>



Morgan's ultra-capitalism is internally coherent, but weighed down by Chomskyan exaggeration and a clumsy Mad Max road-rage system in which people drive FAST and MEAN to get corporate promotion. (Awwwww shit: metaphor!!) Like many a bright-eyed anti-globaliser, Morgan overdoes it; at one point, a senior partner at Shorn erupts into a caricature inhuman plutocrat. I've added numbering to the exec's rant because it is such a dense cluster of Chomskyan muddled good intentions:

<blockquote>Do you really think we can 0) afford to have the developing world develop? You think we could have survived the rise of a modern, articulated Chinese superpower twenty years ago? You think we could manage an Africa full of countries run by intelligent, a) uncorrupt democrats? Or a Latin America run by men like Barranco? Just imagine it for a moment. Whole populations getting 1) educated, and 2) healthy, and 3) secure, and 4) aspirational. 5) Women's right's, for god's sake! We can't afford these things to happen, Chris. Who's going to 6) soak up our subsidised food surplus for us? 7) Who's going to make our shoes and shirts? 8) Who's going to supply us with cheap labour and cheap raw materials? 9) Who's going to buy our arms?" </blockquote>

<blockquote>0) A totally false dichotomy: uncoerced trade is never zero-sum! Also, everyone has an economic interest in the economic development of the world; roughly, the richer my neighbours are, the more they can buy from me, the richer am I. <br>
a) Corruption is terrible for business; it subsumes about <a href="http://www.oecd.org/cleangovbiz/49693613.pdf">one dollar in twenty</a> of the entire world's output. Individually beneficial acts of bribery collectively lead to a ludicrously bad (and anti-capital!) state; 
<br>1) Education is good for economies, and thus good for the West (by point 0); 
<br>2) healthy workers are very good for economies; 
<br>3) suffering war disrupts consumer spending more than anything else (as opposed to the economics of inflicting war, admittedly, but that isn't the plutocrat's point); 
<br>4) (a certain limited form of) aspiration is the very heart of a consumer economy; 
<br>5) there were huge economic gains from feminism; 
<br>6) <a href="http://www.ictsd.org/downloads/2012/08/net-food-importing-developing-countries-who-they-are-and-policy-options-for-global-price-volatility.pdf">this is mildly true</a>, but governmental horrors like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy#Anti-development">CAP</a> give Morgan's rage some urgency;  
<br>7) By 2086? Robots; 8) By 2086? Robots; 
<br>9) This one is true and horrible.
</blockquote>



This economic naivete is balanced by his characteristic virtues: pace, cool uncliched weapons, pro-social rage (here, wifebeaters and Nazis suffer atrocities). In a rarity for SF, Morgan underestimates the rate of tech growth (by 2086): for instance, their drones are much larger and more limited in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqHrTtvFFIs">application</a> than ours are already. (The book is also a good portrait of ordinary marital pain.)

<blockquote>One of his warders offered to let him have some books, but when the promised haul arrived, it consisted of a bare half-dozen battered paperbacks by authors Chris had never heard of. He picked one at random, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon">luridly violent far-future crime novel</a> about a detective who could exchange bodies at will, but the subject matter was alien to him and his attention drifted: it all seemed very far-fetched.</blockquote>



A few nice meanings in there: Morgan's apparent self-deprecation is actually bragging about his still being in print in a hundred years; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Kovacs">Kovacs</a> is just this book's Faulkner character plus genetic mods; thus Faulkner finding the book "alien" is a serious comment on his lack of self-awareness, and explains why the loss of Carla is so fatal to his character (he can't introspect enough to prevent his fall). 

Crass and flashy, but psychologically ambitious. I've read everything Morgan has written despite usually disagreeing with him.

Jonathan Meades (2003)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2018<br>
<br>
Unsentimental, by which I mean unpleasant.

On fertility and death, delusion and meaning, undertakers and civil engineers. Many beautiful passages, much reflection on the course of recent British history - but never didactic -

<blockquote>Ben and Ben's fellow squash prodigy, keen, bulgy-muscled Nolan Oates lolled side by side on a striped recliner and a Portofino chair chosen by Naomi and bought by Henry out of the fruits of his labours burying and burning the dead for the children of the dead.
</blockquote>



<blockquote>They cycled through the night, not knowing where they were going, ignoring maps, signposts, stars, anxious only to be far from that flat scrubland. Fear fuelled their tendons, pushed the pedals hard. They were oblivious to the sycamore’s grazes and to the stiff hills. Their tyres purred. They passed hamlets, silos, byres, kennels, the illumined windows of hostile hearths. The swarthy bulk of a moor’s escarpment slumped against the sky, a beast best left to lie. The world was every shade of black: slave, sump, crow, char. Clumsy clouds lumbered into each other, blind, bloated, slomo, piling up in a piggyback of obese buggers over the terrible trees. The night was loud with the shrieks and moans of creatures berating their fate and their want of shelter. When the rain came it was from a sluice that stretched from one horizon to the next. The road became a tide against them.
</blockquote>


and anyway it's extremely well-grounded in Meades' obsessive attention to detail (not just artistic detail, any detail)

<blockquote>The miracle of life. That baby could now bring a carbon-fibre racket into contact with a rubber ball travelling at 90 m.p.h. in such a way that the ball’s speed would be so reduced that when it touched the front wall of the court it would plummet vertically to the floor. That was a miracle. And so was the human ingenuity which made the connection between that ball’s terminal trajectory and a dead bird and advertised that ingenuity by the use of the figurative construction ‘to kill a ball’. Telephones, butterfly stroke, nylon-tip pens, the emotive capability of music, the way some people are blond and some are left-handed, the shapes of faces in clouds, water’s inability to flow uphill, the tastiness of animals’ flesh, pain, bustles, reptiles’ poison sacs, sinus drainage, cantilevering, DNA testing – miracles of life, all of them.
</blockquote>



Meades is an aesthete - but still rightly unforgiving of art in the wrong place, here an experimental postmodernist roundabout that kills five.

It get better when it stops sneering. The middle section portrays two professions, two quiet lives: funeral director and civil engineer, warm family man and late bloomer:

<blockquote>Exclusion, Henry recognised, was what defined every profession. He practised it himself. It was what differentiated him from civilians. Without exclusion and the stamp of expertise it brought … well, the unthinkable might occur: the bereaved might realise that they could do it themselves, take the law into their own hands. They’d conduct backyard cremations. They’d dig graves in their gardens as though burying the family pet.
</blockquote>


The middle seems natalist; the nuclear family seem much happier. Just wait. The death of your parents as only their being "denied a future of rages, chair-lifts, incontinence, slobbering aphasia, fright, wind, butter on the rug, soup on the cardie...  How long he would have had to prepare himself for the embalming job of a lifetime, how long he would have had to watch as all dignity left her and she became a machine for processing soup into diarrhoea. It might be painful watching them turn into veg, decline into insentient senescence before our eyes but at least it’s a process that acquaints us with loss gradually.".

(Meades contrives a neat point about human nature: when the Crystal Palace burns down, the fire engines couldn't reach it to save it because the roads are congested with spectators. This isn't accurate but whatev.)

Oscillates between sympathy and unforgiving light; suddenly swerves away from two offered happy endings. Not sure what to make of the grim climax - the cuckold going off the deep end, becoming unmoored from his home, his work, his decency. Meades is no patriarch, so the implication shouldn't be 'so would you'. I think it's about the madness of biology, its inhumane imperatives and tragic spread.

Meaty, fine. Book has far fewer plot holes than the show. (Still some though: why does Johnson not put any of his people on the flight to Eros? Why are these intelligent characters so idiotic about aseptic procedure when handling the ultra-horror organism?)

How does it do as Serious science fiction?

Social development: The Belters are an ok attempt at showing the start of speciation. Their creole language is pretty good, also the mannerisms designed for legibility in an EVA suit.

Software development: Naomi is the only coder, maintaining however many million lines.

 Actual Science: the spaceflight physics is good. The economics of the Belt make little sense. The protomolecule (a nanotech spore virus capable of infecting anything regardless of biochemistry) strains belief even before it starts messing with the nature of electromagnetism and gravity in an entire AU volume.

<br>
Faust in Moscow with laffs and a less-straightforward moral; also a solemn and harrowing Passion play; also a revenge play on the various apparatchiks and shill artists that made Bulgakov's life a constant question mark. I loved book one, in which the devil upends Stalinist control with seances, magic tricks, telegram lulz, and horrible trolling of only somewhat venal people.

<blockquote>Love leaped out in front of us like a murderer in an alley leaping out of nowhere, and struck us both at once. As lightning strikes, as a Finnish knife strikes!
</blockquote>

 

It has a sweet fairytale air over and above the murders and the Satanic chaos.

<blockquote>Follow me reader! Who told you that there is no true, faithful, eternal love in this world! May the liar's vile tongue be cut out!</blockquote>

 

Was wondering if it's a Christian novel, but it is heretical to balls. Yeshua to Pilate:

<blockquote>	In fact, I'm beginning to fear that this confusion will go on for a long time. And all because [Mark] writes down what I said incorrectly.</blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885)">"Pride and Prejudice"</a></h3>

Jane Austen (2000)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2010<br>
<br>
I somehow managed to read this right through without grasping an absolutely basic point - which stops it being the tittering romantic comedy it is mistaken for:

The reason everyone in this is obsessed with frilly things like suitors and débuts and balls is that marriage was the most important decision in a woman's whole life, one of the few she had power over.* You only got one shot. The result determined whether your life was an abusive wreck, or hey pretty ok. 

(At the time, to get a divorce you needed 1) to put up with it for three years, 2) to then blow the annual salary of 5 people (£200 then, ~£100,000 in today's money) bringing a fucking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrimonial_Causes_Act_1857#Background">private Act of Parliament</a>; 3) to publicly and credibly state your husband's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_England_and_Wales#History">incest, sodomy, bigamy, or desertion</a>" (not his adultery) and maybe also deal with MPs leering at your sex life. 

Oh, and no remarriage ever, i.e. no socially acceptable relationships ever again.)

All this makes the book about something important, rather than important (or readable) itself. And Austen hardly covers this grimdark aspect. But I will probably have to read it again.

---

* You might say that the primary-relationship-hunt is still the most important decision in modern people's lives. I think that's right for some people, but it's still less important than it was: now it's not the only decision in your life, and now you get to try again if you are unlucky or unwise.

<br>
Read immediately after the 2nd book. This one errs on the splattery side: cybersplatterpunk. Nasty, entertaining look at revolution and market forces. Quotable too: On oppression: “This enemy you cannot kill. You can only drive it back damaged into the depths, and teach your children to watch the waves for its return”; on political pieties: “it’s amazing how constant repetition can make even the most obvious truths irritating enough to disagree with”. 

Morgan still manages to surprise – e.g. the fully sadistic massacre of misogynist priests is hard to forget. The sea planet itself is the best of the new characters, weird and postmodern in layout, mechanics, oligarchy, mores. 

--
How does it do as Serious science fiction?

Social development: The last of the Kovacs novels – I’ll miss the nasty universe, with its fully fleshed-out cybersociety – its religions still boycotting technologies, its new dilemmas (which clone should I repay if their interests conflict?) and crime; its remarriage customs when one spouse gets a new body… It holds up.  

Software development: No.

Minking, mankit, but only superficially amoral - the spike in the femoral artery, the period blood in the soup, the desperate crab-bucket scrabble away, away from the meaningful (the comparatively boring).

Genuinely part of a renaissance in Scots self-consciousness. Which tells you more about how low that was, before. (This was me and my mates' mantra at school:

Another chronicle of Culture fuckups; this time, trying to reform a caste system and sparking a genocidal civil war. It's tense and unpleasant throughout, because of this moral mud.

<blockquote>
'You want to die because your mate is dead and you are pining for her, is that not the truth?'
'I would put it a little stronger than pining. But it was her death that took the meaning out of my life.'
'The lives of your family and your society in this time of need and restructuring; these mean nothing to you?'
'Not nothing, Estodien. But not enough, either. I wish that I could feel otherwise, but I cannot. It is as though all the people I care about but feel I ought to care about more are already in another world from the one I inhabit.'
'She was just... a person, just one individual. What makes her so special that her memory... outranks the more pressing needs of those still alive for whom something can still be done?'
'Nothing, Estodien. It is-'
'Nothing indeed. It is not her memory; it is yours. It is not her specialness or uniqueness that you celebrate, Quilan, but your own. You are a romantic, Quilan. You find the idea of tragic death romantic, you find the idea of joining her - even if it is joining her in oblivion - romantic.' The old male drew himself up as though getting ready to go. 'I hate romantics, Quilan.

<br>
Enormous steampunk social commentary dressed in gorgeous nasty prose&nbsp;(think Nabokov on America). His dank, evil&nbsp;city, 'New Crobuzon', is&nbsp;a dark reboot of Terry Pratchett's Ankh-Morpork (itself a funhouse mirror of Elizabethan London)&nbsp;without&nbsp;its animating sense of fun and justice. Instead, it has class consciousness; satires on academic, tabloid and political speech,&nbsp;misogyny, and a tainted political economy of science/capital/government.

<blockquote>Its substance was known to me. The crawling infinity of colours, the chaos of textures…each one resonated under the step of the dancing mad god, vibrating and sending little echoes of bravery, or hunger, or architecture, or argument, or cabbage or murder or concrete across the aether. The weft of starlings’ motivations connected to the thick, sticky strand of a young thief’s laugh. The fibres stretched taut and glued themselves solidly to a third line, its silk made from the angles of seven flying buttresses to a cathedral roof.</blockquote>

 

What I take to be the central metaphor: one of the oppressed races are found to have a native power - the 'potential energy of crisis' - which, with a scientific harness, could revolutionise the world: i.e. Classical Marxism. Our heroes are not&nbsp;especially heroic.

Aging Romantic pessimist Harry comes to a crisis, and learns that fun is fun (and meaningful). I’ve been avoiding this book because of its status in rockist, hedonist circles, but after the first 50 pages it begins to subvert this reputation, and itself, over and over again until charming. 

Hesse also inserts himself, as the domineering, sparkling ‘Hermine’ which is strange and excellent. 

Would’ve changed my life if I’d read it aged 16, or in 1930. As it is, Regina Spektor, the Supremes and DJ Hixxy had already forced me to admit the existence and glory of non-cognitive, non-consequential, non-political quality.

 Gentle, silly-solemn but limp campus novel. Examines being middle-class middle-age without angst, despite the narrator’s being very hard of hearing. Though there is a sudden token Auschwitz section which gets about one page of build-up and is soon left behind (when the actual plot revives itself). 

It's less farcical - its characters' ambitions less contemptible - its plot less unabashedly neat than Lodge's usual style (though there is this: “Perhaps one day we’ll turn up in a campus novel” – “God, I hope not”). I miss that.

<br>
Funny idle-rich tragedy as usual. Read aloud, and I was at the limits of my sight-reading here; Waugh’s timing and compression are too grand to be scudded, really. 

Check this out for tight material symbolism:<blockquote>Beaver had a dark little sitting-room (on the ground floor, behind the dining room) and his own telephone… objects that had stood in his father’s dressing room; indestructible presents for his wedding and twenty-first birthday, ivory, brass-bound, covered in pigskin, crested and gold-mounted, expressive of Edwardian masculinity…</blockquote>

 (implies Beaver is subordinate to guests and his dead dad, who was married before 21, unlike him...). 

Is Brenda’s infidelity punished in a regressive Victorian way? Yes. But pater gets his too: the nasty colonialist final act is topped off with a crushing twist: Dickens unto death.

Sickly-satisfying but blunt satire on memory, gender and the dark side of memes.

(Not to mention the sinister panopticon modifications of the experimenters, with a public point-scoring table of conformism and no contraception.) The space-opera frame (a software virus that censors people's minds) is good too, wielding the deepest creepiness: brainwashing which actually works.

His first album, with all the glad rough edges and density of new ideas that implies. Bunch of short stories showing off his range and introducing themes. About half are very good, though the others are becoming very dated as the last twenty years of tech and tech hype overtake his speculations.

Heady subversions of the Lovecraftian, the Clancyan, the techno-optimist, and the Doctorovian. The stories are also often silly and humane. His books sometimes receive <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/category/charles-stross-seminar/">symposia from eminent academics</a>.

<br>
Men in Black crossed with the organisational despair of Dilbert , rather than the existential awe of Lovecraft. (“My department, Forecasting Operations, is tasked with attempting to evaluate the efficacy of proposed action initiatives in pursuit of the organization’s goals—notably, the prevention of incursions by gibbering horrors from beyond space-time.”). 

The first Stross I read. I expected forbidding, stark post-Ballard literariness, but it’s matey, British, nerdy (BBC, C++, and Bayes jokes).

Joe Abercrombie (2007)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2013<br>
<br>
Prose is a delight, very free-flowing . There's a sarcastic wizard, a torturer for a protagonist, a corrupt feudal society. 'The blade itself' is from Homer - a rare moment where he recriminates about war. Good details - the torturer's inner monologue is always asking questions, casting doubt - the amputee waggling his stump thoughtfully, scared people forgetting where their sword is (when it's in their hand). Addictive.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46755)">"Surfacing"</a></h3>

Margaret Atwood (1998)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2018<br>
<br>
Ponderous and mean, gnomic and agnostic, as usual. Lots of good details about oafishness and gendered crappiness between and within genders, as usual. Her friend applying makeup is

<blockquote>a seamed and folded imitation of a magazine picture that is itself an imitation of a woman who is also an imitation, the original nowhere, hairless lobed angel in the same heaven where God is a circle, captive princess in someone's head. She is locked in, she isn't allowed to eat or shit or cry or give birth, nothing goes in, nothing comes out. She takes her clothes off or puts them on, paper doll wardrobe, she copulates under strobe lights with the man's torso while his brain watches from its glassed-in control cubicle at the other end of the room, her face twists into poses of exultation and total abandonment, that is all. </blockquote>


The anti-Americanism of the (Canadian) protagonists - so venomous it actually deserves the full title racism - is funny. It hides behind deep-ecology and Romantic critique:

<blockquote>It doesn’t matter what country they’re from, my head said, they’re still Americans, they’re what’s in store for us, what we are turning into. They spread themselves like a virus...  Second-hand American was spreading over him in patches, like mange or lichen. He was infested, garbled, and I couldn’t help him...

My country, sold or drowned, a reservoir; the people were sold along with the land and the animals...

I realized it wasn't the men I hated, it was the Americans, the human beings, men and women both. They'd had their chance but they had turned against the gods, and it was time for me to choose sides. I wanted there to be a machine that could make them vanish, a button I could press that would evaporate them without disturbing anything else, that way there would be more room for the animals, they would be rescued
</blockquote>


David (a rapey leftist idiot) is anti-Yank from the start, but the narrator eventually sinks into a similar kind of hallucinatory environmentalist racism, as part of her rejection of 'the city' and the modern world.

It's unclear why her friends are her friends, since they are trivial and cruel, as she is (initially) not. There's maybe one sympathetic character in the whole book, a taciturn Quebecois handyman who doesn't symbolise much of anything, as far as I can see (not the city, sure, but neither her mystical primitive).

The narrator is full of non sequiturs like "If you tell your children God doesn’t exist they will be forced to believe you are the god", little anti-rational digs which never go challenged. Just because both revolution (David) and the status quo ("Americans"), men and women, are awful, doesn't mean that nature is any better.

She starts off with strong run-on stream of consciousness -

<blockquote>I slide my tongue around the ice cream, trying to concentrate on it, they put seaweed in it now, but I'm starting to shake, why is the road different, he shouldn’t have allowed them to do it, I want to turn around and go back to the city and never find out what happened to him. I’ll start crying, that would be horrible, none of them would know what to do and neither would I. I bite down into the cone and I can’t feel anything for a minute but the knife-hard pain up the side of my face. Anaesthesia, that’s one technique: if it hurts invent a different pain. I’m all right.</blockquote>

 - but apparently forgets this sentence structure about halfway through.

Oddly, it's sort of mirror of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Dream_(novel)">An American Dream</a>: the same atavism, same disgust with modernity, but with violence suffered rather than gleefully inflicted.

Surfacing gets called 'important'. I suppose because of the affectless, doubting-feminist agency of a divorcee angle; I hope it isn't because people think the protagonist had an admirable spiritual journey when really she's driven insane by mistreatment and boredom.

William J. Baumol (2007)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2019<br>
<br>
Thoughtful and lucid nontechnical essays on the very different structures hiding behind the vague anticoncept 'capitalism'. The title alone beats most leftists and rightists, who tend to tacitly deny the existence of good or bad capitalisms, respectively. (Where by good we mean "good for growth and eliminating poverty".) The authors go further of course, with four ideal types:

* state-guided capitalism (China, 60s Japan, Singapore)
* big-firm capitalism (South Korea, Japan, France, North Carolina)
* entrepreneurial capitalism - high growth from small companies doing actually new things, high distribution of gains - (Ireland, UK, California)
* oligarchic capitalism - low growth, low distribution of gains - (Russia, Italy, sometimes South Korea)

They tie these to specific policies, often lacking in these kinds of books. They also accept that what's "good" economic policy depends on your existing base (cf. Ha-Joon Chang's argument for trade barriers for pre-industrial countries). Most of the book is about the conditions and effects of entrepreneurship, but they also find big firms actually necessary ("the best form of capitalism is a blend of entrepreneurial and big-firm"), well before <a href="https://read.macmillan.com/lp/big-business-by-tyler-cowen/">Tyler Cowen</a>.

Decent paean to the moral importance of growth too:

<blockquote>slow growth, especially when coupled with widening inequality, can provide an environment that breeds distrust and often hate. It is not an accident that some of the worst periods of intolerance to African Americans and immigrants in United States history (the late 1800s, the 1930s, 1970s) occurred during periods of slow or negative growth. The worst-case example of this was, of course, the rise of Nazism...

Michael Mandel: 'Such technology-driven growth is essential if we are not to drown in our own problems... Without breakthroughs in medical science, it won't be possible to supply the healthh care to a generation of aging Americans without bankrupting the young. Without breakthroughs in energy production, it won't be possible to bring Third World economies up to industrialised living standards without badly damaging the environment...' </blockquote>

Good book for anyone who thinks they hate economics, or economists, or neoclassical economics, or growth itself. Certainly much more readable and fair than Piketty's mega-bestseller.

<br>
Good example of the most distinctive literary trend of the day: web serial fiction / wiki fiction. Also of the shortcomings of same: the committee fragmentariness and unmanageable hugeness. (I cut this short at page 1000. And this is only one of three giant ebooks of the whole wiki. Phew.)

That's the medium. Its genre is post-pulp post-Lovecraft urban fantasy-horror - the most popular genre? (Aside from old stalwarts, trash romance and MFA lit.) And style's the uncommon pseudoacademic register of Lovecraft's original pulp. 

Its achievement is to dispense with characterisation and rely entirely on atmosphere and startling concepts. There's no protagonist and only hints of antagonists (besides the thousands of SCP objects themselves). 

The Foundation is ludicrously powerful - they've global jurisdiction over law enforcement, run hundreds of fatal human experiments, retain a vast staff and holdings. In order for this to work as horror, they need equally elevated foes - and so they do: they're always being infiltrated, manipulated, stolen from, exsanguinated or bombed. The Foundation commits many atrocities (contrast Delta Green, Dresden Files, Agents of Shield, the X-Files, which are much more anti-authority).

It has all the ordinary kinds of horror - monsters, disease, body horror, mind-rape, invisible forces, alien geometries - but also the greater, rare horror of exponentiation, of facing a foe with the potential to suddenly explode beyond all containment and never stop growing. Another distinctive bit is its <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-048">meta</a> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-049">horror</a>: objects which know the rules of the story and about other objects.

I recommend reading this with the images disabled. They're a labour of love, I know, but the imagination is easier to scare than the eye. Good queasy fun.

<br>
Tiny extract from Walden, which I tried / pretended to read as a teen. great example of a completely different ethos from mine.

He opens with a little C18th verbal dance about how immodest and outré it is to write in the first person about your own life. I sometimes miss that norm, which he helped kill. Then there's the quiet misanthropy and primitivism inside certain forms of the love of nature, which I can't really attribute to him. And lastly the contempt for work, all work except food and shelter and confessional writing anyway.

<blockquote>Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so they take a thousand stitches to-day to save nine tomorrow. As for work, we haven’t any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus’ dance, and cannot possibly keep our heads still. </blockquote>

<br>
Lovely bundle of high school physics and beautiful prose. He is more sensible in this than elsewhere - a young man, close to his technical training, not yet paid to speak nonsense. He sees various things coming twenty years early, like uncrewed probes and transposition, docking, and extraction manoeuvres.

He is said to have "invented" the geostationary satellite. Was he really the only one using basic maths and engineering to think a little way forward in 1945?

Classic prose:

<blockquote>The rocket has already been the instrument of evil, and may be so again. But there is no way back into the past: the choice, as Wells once said, is the Universe - or nothing. Though men and civilisations may yearn for rest, for the Elysian dream of the Lotus Eaters, that is a desire that merges imperceptibly into death. The challenge of the great spaces between the worlds is a stupendous one; but if we fail to meet it, the story of our race will be drawing to its close. Humanity will have turned its back upon the still untrodden heights and will be descending again the long slope that stretches, across a thousand million years of time, down to the shores of the primeval sea.</blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/510493)">"Muscle: Confessions of an Unlikely Bodybuilder"</a></h3>

Samuel Wilson Fussell (1992)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Mar 2021<br>
<br>
Clever portrait of his own descent into madness, or into subculture. The pain and the disgusting force-feeding would be enough, but on top of that there’s the steroids, the constant talcing and oiling, the insane fasting, the niacin overdose to make you flush all over, the injection of inflammatories... He openly depicts his bulking up as a tactic to face the violence and mania of New York, but he is soon swept into growth for growth’s sake. He hates himself, and for four years he takes hyperbolic vengeance on his body.

Weights were more stigmatised in the 80s, so part of this is an apologia, including many moments of giant generosity from his fellow meat-men. But most of it shows the grotesqueness of contorting a body like this, of forcing a life to be about one thing only, any one thing. (Only a very small part of the horror comes from Fussell - a sensitive perceptive Ivy League shoo-in - doing it.) The mental poverty of the lifter credo is yet another stricture.

You should not underestimate the psychological effects of exercise this intense. He becomes a swaggering, brutal loon within months; he stops doing anything at work:

<blockquote>
at work my muscular behavior became a cause of concern on the floor. It was the general consensus that I had gone too far. Way too far. Some could understand the need to “fill out,” as I put it, and gain a few pounds. But two hour sessions in the morning and two more hours at night, five meals a day, vitamin supplements, and protein shakes?
And if that wasn’t enough, well, there was the noise of my accouterments and the demands of my discipline. I installed an industrial-strength stainless steel blender in my cubicle for my shakes. I monopolized the floor’s sole refrigerator for my meats and milk and eggs, and continuously worked the microwave for a fresh feeding.

My cubicle, which I renamed The Growth Center, became a depot for desiccated beef liver tablets, multivitamin packs, bag after bag of branch-chain amino acids, cartons of Carboplex (a carbohydrate concentrate), and protein powder. What with the magazines and the canon scattered across the floor, the whole place was a muscle minefield, but I didn’t see it that way, not then. Not when I was caught in the full raging force of “the disease.”

... Childhood friends called me in consternation. Apparently, my folly was so spectacular, so profoundly perverse, that even they had gotten wind of it. It was worse, somehow, than enlisting in the Marines or buying finger cymbals and joining the Hare Krishnas.

... “Hasn’t it ever crossed your mind that this whole enterprise is rather vulgar? Is it your parents you want to hurt? Is that it? Is it your friends? Are you waiting for this to appear in the Alumni Notes? Goddamnit, why not do something with your life you can really be proud of?”

... “My physical metamorphosis had brought with it a completely different way of perceiving the world and my place in it... I had needed an attitude adjustment. And I don’t know exactly when the transformation happened—all I can say is that it did. Without being fully aware of it myself, I became the kind of man I had once feared and despised. I became, in fact, a bully...

Then, my manner of speech. It had been too tame before, too timid. No wonder I never got my way in life. I went from answering the phone meekly to shrieking “SPEAK!” into the receiver on the first ring
</blockquote>



It’s extremely well written, tasteful and droll and honest, and rammed full of unusual detail. But something is missing.

How much of the spiritual effects were from weights, from pharmaceuticals, or from simply overloading a devotion to something, anything?

I lift, but never like this. I don’t think I do anything so intensely. I, my style and viewpoint, would not survive it.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22245334)">"The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy"</a></h3>

David Graeber (2015)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2015<br>
<br>
Bureaucracy is the dominant structure in adult life throughout the world. And everybody hates it, including the people nominally in power. How does that work? This book is his answer and is full of his usual sparkling sentences and big dubious historical claims:

<blockquote>The organization of the Soviet Union was directly modeled on that of the German postal service.</blockquote>



He is sadly <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2434061627">not to be trusted on technical matters</a> or in fact anything really contentious. But he's good on some other things.

He notes that corporate life is just as bureaucratic as the public sector, but that corporations are rarely called bureaucracies. This is important! He further notes that left-wing utopias tend to envision vastly stifling regulation and committees as their only lever against unfairness and abuse. 

The book is slightly overegged - but compared to most anarchist social theory he is a model of rigour, epistemic care and systematic focus. In fact he is critical of his people's theorists and practitioners:

<blockquote>Foucault’s ascendancy in turn was precisely within those fields of academic endeavor that both became the haven for former radicals, but that were themselves most completely divorced from any access to political power, or increasingly, even to real social movements—which gave Foucault’s emphasis on the “power/knowledge” nexus, the assertion that forms of knowledge are always also forms of social power, indeed, the most important forms of social power, a particular appeal. <br><br>No doubt any such historical argument is a bit caricaturish and unfair; but I think there is a profound truth here. It is not just that we are drawn to areas of density, where our skills at interpretation are best deployed. We also have an increasing tendency to identify what’s interesting and what’s important, to assume places of density are also places of power. The power of bureaucracy shows just how much this is often not the case. </blockquote>


He yields too much to standpoint theory when he is told that they had similar ideas earlier (which he hadn't read and which they didn't put so clearly). But he's fun and witty, heretical to his tribe, original as always.

<blockquote>...if we’re going to actually come up with robots that will do our laundry or tidy up the kitchen, we’re going to have to make sure that whatever replaces capitalism is based on a far more egalitarian distribution of wealth and power — one that no longer contains either the super-rich or desperately poor people willing to do their housework. Only then will technology begin to be marshaled toward human needs. And this is the best reason to break free of the dead hand of the hedge fund managers and the CEOs—to free our fantasies from the screens in which such men have imprisoned them, to let our imaginations once again become a material force in human history.</blockquote>

Norm Macdonald (2016)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Mar 2022<br>
<br>
Not a memoir, not a novel. Very like Hunter Thompson: haha-misery half-obscured by hedonism and trolling. Yes, it’s just a joke, but it’s pretty brutal even by that standard. It simply won't work if you don't have his delivery in mind - the giant child, the diamond pretending to be coal, the anarchist with a penchant for 1950s dad jokes.

This book fakes vast misery so that we won't notice the smaller real stuff.

<blockquote>I’ll claw and tear into this showbiz career of mine and I’ll let the filth fly, like a mad dog digging up bones he buried deep and long ago. And I’ll name names. And I’ll drop bombshells. I bet they’ll pay good money for that kinda thing. For the straight dope on the Hollywood crowd, and the SNLers too. And I need money. I need money to live.
Damn near fifty.
I open the curtains and it’s raining outside. I catch an image of myself in the window, and the rain blurs my thin reflection as if I’m barely there at all. And I see there’s a bruise under my left eye and some dried blood. I look down at my hand, and the heel of my thumb is swollen purple and hurts like a bastard and that makes me happy. It means the girl on the bed was fought for and not bought.</blockquote>



It's way too long, but one of the running gags is that he's just padding it out to meet the contract.
<spoiler>There are three main conceits: 1) Norm constantly jokes about how stupid he is; 2) his friend Adam is even stupider and also a gay prostitute; 3) the book is being written by a ghostwriter slowly being driven insane by Norm's crassness and thoughtlessness.</spoiler>

If it was all true or false you’d know how to feel about it. People say how hilarious they found it, but the first half is grim. He covers his greatest hits, the moth joke and Farley stories. The Weekend Update gags (mostly not written by him) are without exception terrible, instantly dated and weak.

His own are occasionally brilliant.

<blockquote>“I specialized in unskilled labor, and I was good at it.”

"I was making $21.20 a day for Charlie, and Mark was offering fifteen dollars a set. A set took about five minutes and you could do two a night if you were lucky, so the decision was pretty easy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I pull out a vial of liquid morphine and sink my cigarette in it. The narcotic dries fast, adhering to the tobacco. I light up and inhale deeply, listening to the wondrous crackling as the fire hits my lungs and the smoke hits my brain. Then the smoke clears and in the place where it was is now a picture.

A picture hung on the wall of our parlor. In it, a woman was taking a shirt from a clothesline. She had clothespins in her teeth and it was windy and a boy was tugging at her dress. The woman looked like she was in a hurry and the whole scene gave me the idea that, just outside the frame, full, dark clouds were gathering. But that was not what it was.
It was paint.
So I decided right then and there to see the picture as it really was. I stared at the thing long and hard, trying to only see the paint. But it was no use. All my eyes would allow me to see was the lie. In fact, the longer I gazed at the paint, the more false detail I began to imagine. The boy was crying, as if afraid, and the woman was weaker than I had first believed. I finally gave up. I understood then that it takes a powerful imagination to see a thing for what it really is.

...so I glanced back at the open door, where Old Jack stood, but his back was to me now and it was blocking out the light of the moon. I suddenly remembered that I’d read somewhere how the light of the moon was just an illusion and the moon was only a cold, cold stone. I watched Old Jack look from side to side before he turned his gaze on me, and his eyes flashed black like the wing of a crow. He closed the door and the inside of the shed went black. Then I heard the bolt.
I forget what happened next.</blockquote>


That’s a stone dead thing to winkingly fabricate. You need to imagine Norm’s delivery to laugh.

<blockquote>off the captain came over the intercom, as is the custom on airplanes. ‘Good morning,’ the captain said. ‘This is your captain, Pat Johnson, and we will be flying—’ and Sam gave out a wild scream: ‘NOOOOOO!!!!! NOT CRASH JOHNSON! NOT CRASH JOHNSON!!!!!!!!! AAAAA​AAAAA​AAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!’</blockquote>


One of the few actual jokes is him putting dreadful opinions in his mate Eget’s mouth

<blockquote>"Yeah,” says Adam Eget. “I really wish I’d met him, but it was before my time. There are so many great Kinison stories at the Store. It’s so unfair that guys like Sam have to die so young and a sonofabitch like Nelson Mandela lived to be an old man.”
“Nelson Mandela wasn’t a sonofabitch. He fought apartheid and they put him in prison for more than twenty years. And when they finally released him and he took power, he never exacted revenge on his enemies. Instead, he exacted forgiveness on them and brought his torn nation together.”
“I thought he stole some diamonds.”
“No.”
“Didn’t he steal a bunch of diamonds and then sell them back to the guy he stole them from?”
“No.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>I had gotten a gig doing comedy at a hospital, for the patients… I was getting close and getting nervous too. Maybe it was the barbed wire around the perimeter or maybe it was the armed guards. What kind of hospital was I playing, anyway? I got my answer quick enough, because it was written on a big sign: HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE. My agent had never been big on details.
It took me a while just to get into the place. First they patted me down and took all my weapons and my drugs. Then they looked up my ass and took those weapons and those drugs as well<blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Where do I fit in?”
“If I win, you become my head ranch hand and make five percent more money than the other ranch hands and get beaten far less often.”
“Sounds good.” Adam Eget beams. “Do I get my own horse?” “No.”
“But what if you lose and kill yourself? Then where do I fit in?”
I guess that would hurt most men—a guy you’ve known for twenty years asking what he gets when you toss away your soul in a Las Vegas hotel room—but I understand the ways of men, all right. Everybody’s in it for himself. Adam Eget’s just like everyone else. And my Plan B also takes care of him after I murder myself in cold blood.
“You’re the one who finds me dead, and you cry and shake like a little girl, the way you just did a minute ago. Then later you write a book about me and they pay you money.”
“But I can’t write. I’m not smart enough.”
“Don’t worry about that, Adam Eget. For idiots like you, they provide a ghostwriter. A ghostwriter is a man blessed with bright talent but cursed with dim luck. The brilliant ghostwriter will do all the work and receive a pittance, while you, an illiterate fool, will be given a king’s ransom. That’s God’s great joke, my son.”</blockquote>



<spoiler><blockquote>My name’s Keane. I’m a ghostwriter. Nothing you have read in this book has been written by Mr. Macdonald. That is my job, to write these sorts of books for these sorts of people. But this one I was excited about. I was a very, very big fan of Norm Macdonald.

And suddenly I found myself an old man standing in a doorway as Mr. Macdonald spoke of how he didn’t trust Eskimos and never would. I had never felt such instant animus toward anyone. And I remember thinking that this time I might not take the job. I might just walk out of the office.
But I stayed put as Mr. Macdonald mercifully finished his “story.”
“...and so, anyways, the point is I’ve never met an Eskimo I liked. Not once. Not ever. As a matter of fact I don’t think I’ve ever even met an Eskimo. I call them blubber-eaters, by the way. And don’t even get me started on the filthy Swedes.” He struck the table with his fist and Julie burst into laughter. I’d heard many silly celebrities tell their silly stories in my time. They always amused me, the way a harmless child amuses me. But Mr. Macdonald appalled me. The way a harmful child appalls me.</blockquote>

Lots of outre gags from the short window between Lenny Bruce and Louis CK:

<blockquote>I’m willing to make a deal with you, Adelman. We are both civilized men. You quit raping me right now and there’ll be no hard feelings. And you won’t see a reprisal rape outta me either, I promise you that.”</blockquote>



The gambling sections are probably psychologically true, which I judge by how moving they are.

<blockquote>I remember a psychiatrist once telling me that I gamble in order to escape the reality of life, and I told him that’s why everyone does everything... why the attraction? Most people would think it’s the wins that keep the gambler going, but any gambler knows this is not true. As you place your chips on the craps table, you feel anxiety and impatience. When the red dice hit the green felt with a thunk and you’re declared the winner and the chips are pushed toward you, you feel relief. Relief is all. And relief is fine, but hardly what a man would give the whole rest of his life to gain. It has to be something else, and the best I’ve come up with is this: It is a particular moment. A magic moment that occurs after the placing of a bet and before the result of that bet. It is after the red dice are thrown but before they lie still on the green felt where they fall. It is when the dice are in the air, and as long as they are there, time stops. As long as the red dice are in the air, the gambler has hope. And hope is a wonderful thing to be addicted to.
“Better luck next time, sir."<br><br>

...my chip denominations had climbed from the original five-dollar chip to a thousand-dollar chip, and finally, at about the hour mark, I was playing with the maximum five-thousand-dollar chip. The funny thing is, the five-dollar chip was the very same size as the five-thousand-dollar chip. Probably cost the same to make. But it was worth a thousand times more.

I was winning big time now. I began to feel an extraordinary transformation taking place deep within me, one that mirrored my chip’s transformation, for I felt myself double in value and then redouble and press to the maximum. I was the same exact size physically, and yet I was worth much more, a thousand times more, and that lingering suspicion that I might be a nobody was long gone. The Asian player rolled for twenty more minutes, and finally he rolled a seven and the run was over. Everyone cheered and I had a hundred eighteen thousand dollars in chips. I colored up, threw a fifty-dollar tip on the table, and left in perfect calm and elation, big as God inside</blockquote>

<blockquote>Miles craned his neck for a look out the window as the glittering lights of Greater London and its island fell away beneath them. In another moment he could see the river mouth, with its great dykes and locks running for forty kilometers, defining the coastline to human design, shutting out the sea and protecting the historical treasures and several million souls of the lower Thames watershed. One of the huge channel-spanning bridges gleamed against the leaden dawn water beyond. And so men organized themselves for the sake of their technology as they never had for their principles. The sea’s politics were unarguable.</blockquote>

I’m away from home, and so must have a falsely distinctive version of it.

He avoids the kailyard by focussing on tatties instead (the Classics, drunks and work-sore backs, over the lad o’ pairts and the light on the rapeseed).

<br>
Quite scattered and prolonged, with too many plots, thus ending up feeling like no plot. But still good. (People say this is the worst one but it is still better than most novels.) There are 30 notable moments (sailors as manservants, Mrs Williams’ idiot machiavellianism, Scrivens’ poster, the Canning offer, the experimental weapon, press-ganging the debt-bailiffs, dressing Jack as a bear, the undischarged duel, Jack’s powerful fear of bees) and 5 or so bravura passages

<blockquote>Tides, tides, the Cove of Cork, the embarkation waiting on the moon, a tall swift-pacing mule in the bare torrid mountains quivering in the sun, palmetto-scrub, Señor don Esteban Maturin y Domanova kisses the feet of the very reverend Lord Abbot of Montserrat and begs the honour of an audience. The endless white road winding, the inhuman landscape of Aragon, cruel sun and weariness, dust, weariness to the heart, and doubt. What was independence but a word? What did any form of government matter? Freedom: to do what? Disgust, so strong that he leant against the saddle, hardly able to bring himself to mount. A shower on the Maladetta, and everywhere the scent of thyme: eagles wheeling under thunder-clouds, rising, rising. 'My mind is too confused for anything but direct action,' he said. 'The flight disguised as an advance.”

“The lonely beach, lanterns flashing from the offing, an infinity of sea. Ireland again, with such memories at every turn. 'If I could throw off some of this burden of memory,' said Stephen to his second glass of laudanum, 'I should be more nearly sane. Here's to you, Villiers, my dear.' The Holyhead mail and two hundred and seventy miles of rattling jerking, falling asleep, waking in another country: rain, rain, rain: Welsh voices in the night. London, and his report, trying to disentangle the strands of altruism, silliness, mere enthusiasm, self-seeking, love of violence, personal resentment; trying too to give the impossible plain answer to the question 'Is Spain going to join France against us, and if so, when?' And there he was in Deal once more, sitting alone in the snug of the Rose and Crown, watching the shipping in the Downs and drinking a pot of tea: he had an odd detachment from all this familiar scene - the uniforms that passed outside his bow-window were intimately well known, but it was as though they belonged to another world, a world at one or two removes, and as though their inhabitants, walking, laughing, talking out[…]” </blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Two roast-beefs to see you, sir,' said an orderly.
'Oh no!' cried Captain Christy-Pallière, 'not at this hour, holy name. Tell them I am not here, Jeannot. I may be back at five. Who are they?'
'The first is Aubrey, Jacques. He claims to be a captain in their navy,' said the orderly, narrowing his eyes and scanning the official slip in his hand. 'Born 1 April 1066, at Bedlam, London. Father's profession, monk: mother's, nun. Mother's maiden name, Borgia, Lucrèce. The other pilgrim is Maturin, Etienne -'
'Quick, quick,' cried Captain Christy-Pallière. 'My breeches, Jeannot, my cravat -' for ease and commodity he had been sitting in his drawers. 'Son of a whore, my shirt. Penhoet, we must have a real dinner today - find a clothes-brush, Jeannot - this is the English prisoner I was telling you about. Excellent seaman, charming company. You will not mind speaking English, of course. How do I look?'
'So pimping as possible,' said Captain Penhoet in that language. 'Camber the torso, and you will impose yourself of their attention.  </blockquote>



But all the foxhunting and marriage chitchat does derail things a lot. A perfect summary of Jack’s foolish idea of romance, which is still the default one:

<blockquote>It occurred to him that he should put some order into his thoughts about these two [women]. Yet there was something so very odious, so very grossly indecent, in making any sort of comparison, in weighing up, setting side by side, evaluating. Stephen blamed him for being muddle-headed, wantonly muddle-headed, refusing to follow his ideas to their logical conclusion. 'You have all the English vices, my dear, including muddle-headed sentiment and hypocrisy.' Yet it was nonsense to drag in logic where logic did not apply. To think clearly in such a case was inexpressibly repugnant: logic could apply only to a deliberate seduction or to a marriage of interest. </blockquote>


O’Brian does the following often (a quick cut, or object transition, or something):

<blockquote>‘If you are to see the First Lord in the morning, your mind must be in a condition of easy complaisance, in a placid, rested state. There is milk in the little crock - warmed milk will relax the fibres.'

Jack warmed it, added a dash of rum from his case-bottle, and drank it up; but in spite of his faith in the draught, the fibres remained tense, the placidity of mind a great way off. </blockquote>



The first paragraph is at a party; the second is back at home, with the farewells, cloakroom, cab-hailing, ride, and key-fumbling all elided. Jack has warped through the mention of milk, to the milk. So simple, but because it demands an inference it slows me down and gives me a lift, once or twice a chapter. Flatters the reader, saves on boring exposition, and provides a visual click, all in one.

Not impressed with Villiers yet.

<blockquote>Even a frigid, self-sufficing man needs something of this interchange if he is not to die in his unmechanical part: natural philosophy, music, dead men's conversation, is not enough...

It was not that he did not like the land - capital place; such games, such fun - but the difficulties there, the complications, were so vague and imprecise, reaching one behind another, no end to them: nothing a man could get hold of. Here, although life was complex enough in all conscience, he could at least attempt to cope with anything that turned up. Life at sea had the great advantage that - something was amiss.</blockquote>

Chinese is great for aphorism, because it’s so concise and full of rhymes. But the content of this disappointed me; I was looking for wit, something I’d want to use, and mostly got hectoring maxims in a parental or lordly mode. Lots of comparing people to work animals or resources (lumber).

A lot of the advice, like the whole section about shutting your mouth, is overfit to China, or ancient China. Either way, revealing. But nothing here is as crystallised as the admonition to a loud or whirling child: “[have a] <a href="https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=https://zh.m.wiktionary.org/zh-hans/%25E5%25B0%258F%25E5%25BF%2583&prev=search&pto=aue">small heart!</a>” 

Very good beginner’s Mandarin practice. The originals are sometimes pithy, the translations are mostly trite (two or three times as long), and easily improvable (see below). The hanzi are very simple, HSK3 would do.

To actually learn (grok) something, you need

1. To do it, not just read about it
2. To read it several times
3. To feel challenged but not overwhelmed by it

And 2&3 conflict.

Kind of annoying that the figures are never next to their discussion. And I was hoping this would make me like R but I can't and I don't. But good.

One of the few machines I love (despite always going on about how machines are as distinctively human and at least as expressive of deep values as paintings or concertos).

They built 32 of them; 12 of them crashed. That looks absurdly poor, but it represents 11 thousand hours flying at Mach 3, over thirty years service. And only one death somehow.

This book is dry and rote, the prose of a man who has written sixty years of memos and nothing else. Worth it for the hilarious, terrifying deadpan of some of the pilots. Bill Weaver:

<blockquote>Without proper scheduling, disturbances inside the inlet could result in the shock wave being expelled forward—a phenomenon known as an “inlet unstart”... An immediate unstart occurred on the right engine, forcing the aircraft to roll further right and start to pitch up. I jammed the control stick as far left and forward as it would go.
No response. I instantly knew we were in for a wild ride.
I attempted to tell Jim what was happening and to stay with the airplane until we reached a lower speed and altitude. I don’t think the chances of surviving an ejection at Mach 3.18 and 78,800 ft. were very good. However, g-forces built up so rapidly that my words came out garbled and unintelligible, as confirmed later by the cockpit voice recorder... Everything seemed to unfold in slow motion. I learned later the time from event onset to catastrophic departure from controlled flight was only two to three seconds. Still trying to communicate with Jim, I blacked out, succumbing to extremely high g-forces.
Then the SR-71... literally disintegrated around us...
Before the breakup, we’d started a turn in the New Mexico-Colorado-Oklahoma-Texas border region. The SR-71 had a turning radius of about a hundred miles at that speed and altitude, so I wasn’t even sure what state we were going to land in...
Extracting myself from the parachute harness, I discovered the source of those flapping-strap noises heard on the way down. My seat belt and shoulder harness were still draped around me, attached and latched. The lap belt had been shredded on each side of my hips, where the straps had fed through knurled adjustment rollers. The shoulder harness had shredded in a similar manner across my back. The ejection seat had never left the airplane; I had been ripped out of it by the extreme forces, seat belt and shoulder harness still fastened. I also noted that one of the two lines that supplied oxygen to my pressure suit had come loose, and the other was barely hanging on...
Parts were scattered over an area approximately fifteen miles long and ten miles wide. Extremely high air loads and g-forces, both positive and negative, had literally ripped Jim and me from the airplane. Unbelievably good luck is the only explanation for my escaping relatively unscathed from that disintegrating aircraft.

Teeters on the edge of greatness.

Interesting for the jeopardy it places its characters in despite their great and magic tech. Somehow his soft technologies - the "stasis field" and the "variable-sword" (lightsaber) - feel real, because he pays consistent attention to tolerances, constraints, parameters.

Not literary, not hard, and yet not pulp. successful.

What's the name of the thing where you don't like a genre, but you do like deconstructions of it? I have it with horror (Cabin in the Woods and Tucker and Dale vs Evil!) and now, to my surprise, with shonen anime (Evangelion, Mob Psycho and this). Despite appearances OPM is a serious comment on credentialism, mob psychology, existentialism. The heroes and monsters are all ranked, but the ranking has little relation to their power. The unboundedly powerful protagonist is quite depressed because nothing in life is a challenge to him any more, no foe ever lasts.

(Disappointed by the second series of the TV show, so turned to this.)

The art is <a href="https://preview.redd.it/vqnhaxbaitw11.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c4cc33087cad3c5525aa2de6e30368a3659d3aa6">surprisingly bad</a> (though the creator improved massively over a couple of years). Unlike most manga it looks like what it is: a five day rush job. The show plays with this by using art crudeness to represent Saitama's emotional state: when he's actually focussing <a href="https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F736x%2Fc4%2F9d%2F7f%2Fc49d7fc8126b50f8f4d21f500d69b2ef--puch-saitama-one-punch-man.jpg&f=1">he's drawn</a> <a href="https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2Ffe%2Fc2%2F29%2Ffec229decb761c4f5d77e72ae87f8b1a.png&f=1">in great detail</a>. The other 99% percent of the time he's round-faced, blank, and unshaded to represent how little effort he is giving whatever perilous situation the world is in.

<br>
<blockquote>[Mexico is] a foreign country where I spent a day or so under two months... Superficial acquaintance is one of the materials of our trade.  Other professions are equally culpable; the barrister spends an evening or two studying his brief, pleads in court as though he had never had any other interest in life than the welfare of the litigants, and, over his luncheon, forgets... everything about them. The medical specialist gives his diagnosis in an hour on a patient he has never seen in health and of whose life history he knows no more than a few routine questions will elicit. Compared with them a journalist is less presumptuous. </blockquote>


A <a href="https://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/places-to-visit/worth-abbey">bought</a> polemic against nationalization ("when a rich and essential British industry was openly stolen in time of peace") - journalism with a foregone conclusion (as usual) but even more sordid. So I expected to find it sick, but Waugh is of course fizzing and charming. (As so often, the trouble is the shill is actually honest - he believes everything he's saying; the money did not in fact get him to change his views. The <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/filtered-evidence">corruption</a>, such as it is, happens before, when he was picked because they knew he'd say the right thing on his own.

<blockquote>At the age of thirty-five one needs to go to the moon, or some such place, to recapture the excitement with which one first landed at Calais. For many people Mexico has, in the past, had this lunar character. Lunar it still remains, but in no poetic sense. It is waste land, part of a dead or, at any rate, a dying planet. Politics, everywhere destructive, have here dried up the place, frozen it, cracked it and powdered it to dust...

Having read this brief summary of the political opinions I took with me to Mexico, the reader who finds it unsympathetic may send the book back to her library and apply for something more soothing.</blockquote>


(Written in 1939 - checks out.)

Surprisingly little of it is about the oil nationalisation. ("in common speech and in historical fact, Mexico is the tableland—the Mesa Central de Anahuac, a vast, rocky, temperate area tilted towards the Pacific, 1,500 miles long by 500 or 600 miles in width. It is superb country, mountainous, volcanic, cracked and pitted with green cultivable valleys and wooded slopes rising above the snow line, into angular shining peaks ; graced, every few miles, by the domes and facades of the conquerors’ churches ; when the clouds lift, everything is a shade sharper and brighter in the thin, dry air of the highlands than seems natural to Northern eyes.")

Waugh is conventional in an extremely unconventional way, and idiosyncracy is the first if not the only requirement of literature.

<blockquote>It is a long abandoned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_hypothesis#Criticisms">belief</a> that tourism, like competitive athletics, makes for international friendship. The three most hated peoples in the world — Germans, Americans and British— are the keenest sight-seers. There are very few English villagers who have seen an Egyptian; very few Egyptian villagers who have not seen an Englishman ; the result is that the English generally are well disposed towards Egypt, while the Egyptians detest us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Some of the Mexicans in the government party have realized that the tourists do not come simply to exercise their motor cars or, now that Prohibition is more or less over, to drink imported whiskey... that if you want some proofed canvas to patch a roof it is cheaper in the long run to buy a piece, than to clamber onto the altar of the village church and cut a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Cabrera_(painter)">Cabrera</a> out...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Americans undoubtedly feel a sense of responsibility towards Mexico... not so much kinship as proprietorship... His was the attitude of the nineteenth century Englishman towards Ireland... he overlooked the one vital difference — that Mexico was a foreign country. His attitude, I think, is still in the main that of the State Department at Washington.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Besides the holidaymakers and the sentimentalists there is a third rapidly increasing group of foreign visitors to Mexico. These are the ideologues ; first in Moscow, then in Barcelona, now in Mexico these credulous pilgrims pursue their quest for the promised land ; constantly disappointed, never disillusioned, ever thirsty for the phrases in which they find refreshment. They have flocked to Mexico in the last few months for the present rulers have picked up a Marxist vocabulary</blockquote>

Anthony Giddens (2006)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2014<br>
<br>
(Credibility note: I went to sociology lectures I wasn’t registered for; that plus this book is all I know. The following thus risks making the mistake of disgruntled undergrads everywhere: assuming that my limited understanding of a field is all the field is. Still:) 

Even that might have exhausted the intellectual benefits. Owing to blameless methodological difficulties (e.g. the 'causal density' of human behaviour, that <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_3_social-science.html">little experimentation is possible</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effects</a>, low statistical power), those benefits are mostly 1) reminders and details of how social structures hurt people, and 2) some new vocabulary - rather than subterranean insight or predictive progress in the understanding of societies. 

(Kudos to Giddens for this passage: “…is sociology merely a restatement, in abstract jargon, of things we already know? Sociology at its worst can be exactly that…”)

(1): If you already don’t persecute people out of ignorance, and already know which groups are ill-treated or unlucky (whether or not you ill-treat them), then (1) is already checked off.

(2): Some of those new words: ‘socialisation’ vs ‘<a href="http://www.theory.org.uk/giddens2.htm">structuration</a>’, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verstehen">Verstehen oder Erklärung</a>, or the disturbing hypothesis <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/">stereotype threat</a>, or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_status">master status</a> of a given society, or the ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_and_latent_functions_and_dysfunctions">manifest</a>’ vs the ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_and_latent_functions_and_dysfunctions">latent</a>’ functions of an action. 

Sociology seems good at unpicking ‘neoliberal’ delusions (roughly the set of theodicies that say, “Everything bad about society is just individuals making free decisions, so back off”) – but is (<a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2014/03/27/book-review-punk-sociology-by-david-beer/">usually</a>) poor at following through with the counterpart doubt: wondering if our neat structural explanations are as applicable or explanatory as we like to think. 

Interactionism is one clearly valuable strand, because it's empirical and bottom-up. (It is harder for us to disappear up our own ass with our ear that close to the ground.) Also there's whatever school <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/">Kieran Healy</a> represents - unless, cruel fate, he's the only one.

<br>
The smug faultlessness of Kellhus, already annoying in the last book, becomes an intolerable drone through all of this one.

Bakker remains wise and eloquent in places, and the battles are good. He's particularly good at showing the horror in being <a href="https://arbital.com/p/uncontainability/">cognitively enclosed</a>; sex; and the weakness of reason against social proof / ratfucking / etiquette.

<blockquote>For a long moment no one dared speak, and with startled wonder, Achamian realized he had actually reached them. For once they’d listened with their hearts! They believe! Then Ikurei Conphas began stamping his foot and slapping his thigh, calling, “Hussaa! Hu-hu-hussaaa!” Another on the tiers, General Sompas, joined him . . . “Hussaa! Hu-hu-hussaaa!” A mockery of the traditional Nansur cheer. The laughter was hesitant at first, but within moments, it boomed through the chamber. The Lords of the Holy War had made their wager.</blockquote>



But this was a fawning slog.

<blockquote> To be a teacher was to be a student anew, to relive the intoxication of insight, and to be a prophet, to sketch the world down to its very foundation—not simply to tease sight from blindness, but to demand that another see.

[mindgames], as the Ainoni were fond of saying, brooked no consent. If one man played, everyone played.

it was the principle that galled her, not some dimwitted feminine confusion of hope and piety

His large eyes glittered through the fingers of his fraudulent face. 

When one believed, one’s soul was moved. When one didn’t, everything else moved.

All men are greater than dead men.

If one couldn’t trust the God’s own voice, if one refused to listen—even for sentiment’s sake!—then everything became scepticism—scholarly disputation. Xinemus listened to his heart, and this was both his strength and his weakness. The heart recited no scripture...

[Mocking theism's selfishness:] "Give without expectation of reward, and you can expect a huge reward!’” Achamian

To open a book was not only to seize a moment of helplessness, not only to relinquish a jealous handful of heartbeats to the unpredictable mark of another man’s quill, it was to allow oneself to be written. For what was a book if not a long consecutive surrender to the movements of another’s soul?

the sin of the idolater is not that he worships stone, but that he worships one stone over others</blockquote>



I notice that both Cnaiur and Achamian are or were "weepers". And they've grown out of it, by which I mean they have hardened into lifeless husks.

<blockquote>Not once had he wept for his friend. He, the weeper. . . </blockquote>

<br>
Flashes of brilliance but he mostly continues to squander the amazing setup from book 1.

Like any good manipulator, Kellhus often says true things:

<blockquote>' "Why do so many give, when it is so easy to take?" But you ask these questions because you know nothing of strength. For what is strength but the resolve to deny base inclinations—the determination to sacrifice in the name of one's brothers? You, Ikurei Conphas, know only weakness, and because it takes strength to acknowledge weakness, you call your weakness strength.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>The world is about to end. The world is about to end. Said enough times, any phrase — even this one — was sure to be leached of its meaning... Two thousand years of preparation, it seemed, had left them utterly unprepared...

Esmenet felt it then, overpowering her, and in the strange fashion of moving souls, she struggled to ward it away. But it was too late. For what seemed the first time, she understood: his pointless urgency, his desperation to be believed, his haggard love, his short-winded compassion—shadows of the Apocalypse, all. To witness the dissolution of nations, to be stripped night after night of everything cherished, everything fair. The miracle was that he still loved, that he still recognized mercy, pity

when the gears do not meet, they become as teeth. So it is with men and their machinations... Only when things were broken did their meaning become clear.

"For your entire life you yearned for a bold God, not one who skulked in scriptoriums, whispering the inaudible to the insane."

"The players of viramsata have made games of truth. They tell lies about who said what to whom, about who makes love to whomever, and so on. They do this continually, and what is more, they are at pains to act out the lies told by others, especially when they are elegant, so they might make them true. And so it goes from tongue to lip to tongue, until no distinction remains between what is a lie and what is true. "In the end, at a great ceremony, it is the most compelling tale that is declared Pirvirsut, a word that means 'this breath is ground' in ancient Vaparsi. The weak, the inelegant, have died, while others grow strong, yielding only to the Pirvirsut, the Breath-that-is-Ground. "Do you see? The viramsata, they become living things, and we are their battle plain."

the feeling of certainty is no more a marker of truth than the feeling of will is a marker of freedom

Kellhus had given these men more than gestures or promises, more even than insight or direction. He had given them dominion. Over their doubts. Over their most hated foes. He had made them strong. But how could lies do such a thing? ...what looked like hope or truth or love from within could be a scythe or a hammer, things wielded for other ends, when seen from without.

...He was no longer of the People. He was more. There was no thought he could not think. No act he could not undertake. No lips he could not kiss ... Nothing was forbidden... there were truces, the coming together of coincidental interests, but nothing else, nothing meaningful. Kellhus had taught him that. He cackled aloud when the revelation struck, and for a moment the world itself wobbled. A sense of power suffused him, so intense it seemed something other might snap from his frame, that throwing out his arms he could shear Joktha's walls from their foundations, cast them to the horizon. No reason bound him. Nothing. No scruple, no instinct, no habit, no calculation, no hate ... He stood beyond origin or outcome. He stood nowhere. "The men wonder," Troyatti said cautiously, "what amuses you, Lord." Cnaiür grinned. "That I once cared for my life."

[With horror:] They make us love! They make us love!

<br>
All the classic contradictions - kawaii and banality, sullen obesiance and batshit intensity, mono no aware and sexual frustration.

There are five great stories (“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Screen">Hell Screen</a>”, '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanshir%C5%8D_(novel)">Sanshirō</a>', “<a href="http://www1.udel.edu/History-old/figal/hist371/assets/pdfs/or4.pdf">American Hijiki</a>”, “<a href="https://granta.com/pink/">Pink</a>”, “Mr. English”) and 10 or so enjoyable squibs (out of around 40). There aren't many great sentences, but greatness doesn't strictly need em.

<blockquote>spinning slowly all in unison, and Naomi found herself joining them, looking up into the sky just as she had before, but this time she felt she was falling, and...perhaps... they could go back to before they'd twisted their bodies in wicked prayer and find some other way to free themselves from a world become a living hell, and so she vowed that once they'd wound the world back a full nineteen years, they would take it in their hands again and make it theirs at last; on and on she spun, every revolution a prayer in reverse.</blockquote>



Conspicuous by its absence is Shōwa fascism* - there are no positive or negative references, nor (modern German-style) defensive rightful disownment. The war is there, the terrible firestorms, the terrible hunger; but nothing of the cult (a <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-zen-ideas-that-propelled-japan-s-young-kamikaze-pilots">death cult</a>, king cult, Prussia cult, and race cult) that caused them. There is a little bit of Edo totalitarianism (a lord having a maiden burned alive to render a painting of hell more realistic) at least. 

That said, one of the great achievements of 'American Hijiki' is to show how resentment and insularity can come from other sources than hibakusha trauma or psychotic Imperial pique.

<blockquote>no Japanese can understand it, probably, if he's not my age. No Japanese who can have an ordinary conversation with an American, who can go to America and have Americans all around him without going crazy, who can see an American enter his field of vision and feel no need to brace himself, who can speak English without embarrassment, who condemns Americans, who applauds Americans, no Japanese like this can understand... what I have is an incurable disease, the Great American Allergy.
</blockquote>



The allure and/or horror of Western things (booze, books, bodies) features in maybe half of these. It is very common for the stories to end on an inconclusive, ambiguous, middle-distance-staring notes.

I continue to see little in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima">Mishima</a>'s lascivious, sadistic honour, though I suppose I should thus admire the portrayal of an alien outlook, which might well have overtaken the liberal-ironic-rationalist one. But Akutagawa does that better. In general I didn't see much correlation between eminence and quality (though this judgment is from behind that thick screen, translation).

Only one piece, 'Same as Always' (about harming your child) stands for Japan's powerful, distinctive kind of horror.

The Hiroshima piece is surprisingly flat, journalistic. I've cried at exhibits about the bombs before, so it ain't me.


I liked Murakami's introduction, where he admits hostility to, and ignorance of, modern Japanese fiction:

<blockquote> for a long while I was convinced that, with a few exceptions, early modern and contemporary Japanese literature was simply boring. There were many reasons for this, but foremost among them may be that the novels and stories we were assigned to read in school were pretty bad. My “I-novel allergy” was also quite strong back then (these days, to be sure, it has become less intense), and since you can’t hope either to make your way through or to understand modern Japanese literature if you’re going to avoid its constitutional predisposition to producing “I novels,” I made a conscious effort while young to avoid getting anywhere near Japanese literature.
</blockquote>



though both of his included stories are kind of dull, unaffecting.

An enormous collection of novels - a spy thriller, and a military farce, and a comparative history (of Showa Japan, Churchill Britain, Roosevelt America, the pre- and post-Marcos Philippines), and an oral history of computing, and a modern legal psychodrama, and a family saga of three large dynasties. And a divisive book:

1) It is extremely focussed on men and masculine mindset - guts and brutality, mathematical facility, mind-numbing horniness, how shit works, emotional impermeability, pride in being a stereotype. (Scroll down to see reviews reacting in highly exaggerated ways to this fact, with either horror or delight.)

<blockquote>Men who believe that they are accomplishing something by speaking speak in a different way from men who believe that speaking is a waste of time... there might be a third category... [Waterhouse] speaks, not as a way of telling you a bunch of stuff he's already figured out, but as a way of making up a bunch of new shit as he goes along. And he always seems to be hoping that you'll join in. Which no one ever does.</blockquote>


On the wonder and absurdity of social etiquette:<blockquote>The room contains a few dozen living human bodies, each one a big sack of guts and fluids so highly compressed that it will squirt for a few yards when pierced. Each one is built around an armature of 206 bones connected to each other by notoriously fault-prone joints that are given to obnoxious creaking, grinding, and popping noises when they are in other than pristine condition. This structure is draped with throbbing steak, inflated with clenching air sacks, and pierced by a Gordian sewer filled with burbling acid and compressed gas and asquirt with vile enzymes and solvents produced by many dark, gamy nuggets of genetically programmed meat strung along its length. Slugs of dissolving food are forced down this sloppy labyrinth by serialized convulsions, decaying into gas, liquid, and solid matter which must all be regularly vented to the outside world lest the owner go toxic and drop dead. Spherical, gel-packed cameras swivel in mucus greased ball joints. Infinite phalanxes of cilia beat back invading particles, encapsulate them in goo for later disposal. In each body a centrally located muscle flails away at an eternal, circulating torrent of pressurized gravy. And yet, despite all of this, not one of those bodies makes a single sound during the sultan's speech.</blockquote>


Half of this is an accurate portrayal of 40s gender politics, half a defensive reaction to contemporary blank-slateism. I don't think it's a malign kind of masculinity, though there are only a couple of female characters who don't have at least peripheral or inverted sexiness - if you can't handle that I'd avoid it. A good point to bail out would be the bit where Waterhouse models the effect of masturbation vs sex on his cognition as a periodic timeseries. I'm very hard to offend, but the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/04/style-guide-not-sounding-like-an-evil-robot/">constant use</a> of "females" got to me, by page 400.

<blockquote>Randy stares directly into the eyes of the female customs official and says, "The Internet." Totally factitious understanding dawns on the woman’s face, and her eyes ping bosswards. The boss, still deeply absorbed in an article about the next generation of high-speed routers, shoves out his lower lip and nods, like every other nineties American male who senses that knowing this stuff is now as intrinsic to maleness as changing flat tires was to Dad. "I hear that’s really exciting now," the woman says in a completely different tone of voice, and begins scooping Randy’s stuff together into a big pile so that he can repack it. Suddenly the spell is broken, Randy is a member in good standing of American society again, having cheerfully endured this process of being ritually goosed by the Government.</blockquote>



2) It is also a partisan in the Arts vs STEM "culture war". (In fact Stephenson is often dismissive of all academia - "grad students existed not to learn things but to relieve the tenured faculty members of tiresome burdens such as educating people and doing research".) One of the most important scenes in the book shows a lone techie clashing with a self-appointed jury of stereotypically appalling critical theorists: they speak nonsense about an objective matter, he correctly calls them on it, they cover him in ad hominem bulverism until he gives in. It's not without nuance: his champion in the fight Randy is later shown sulking and reliving it and admitting his own pettiness:

<blockquote>“I strenuously object to being labeled and pigeonholed and stereotyped as a technocrat,” Randy said, deliberately using oppressed-person’s language maybe in an attempt to turn their weapons against them but more likely (he thinks, lying in bed at three A.M. in the Manila Hotel) out of an uncontrollable urge to be a prick.</blockquote>

 

3) There are a lot of coincidences, much more than the novelistic baseline. Characters meet Atanasoff and Turing and Reagan and MacArthur. (A Nazi submarine captain makes a sneering reference to a bureaucratic nightmare being something out of "that Jew Kafka". I thought this was an absurd anachronism, but looking into it, the Nazi could easily have read him, but could not have made the reference to a Brit and expected it to stick. English translation of Das Schloss in 1930 but it didn't take off until after the war.) This is cute/trite on its own, but I find it helpful to imagine Stephenson looking down at history, selecting a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Littlewood">particularly interesting sub-graph</a> from the population

4) There are lots of info-dumps. Large sections of this are indistiguishable from nonfiction. ("This pause is called the horizontal retrace interval. Another one will occur...") People seem to hate this, but it is fine since it's done through aspie characters who absolutely do talk like that.

5) It has a lot of pulpy Feats, fuck-yeah setpieces which fiction this good usually foregoes. Tropical headhunters; escape from a collapsing mineshaft; cryptocurrency in the 90s; tactical blackface; drinking and lolling with your Nazi captors; etc.

<blockquote>It would be an idyllic tropical paradise of not for the malaria, the insects, the constant diarrhea and resulting hemorrhoids, and the fact that the people are dirty and smell bad and deat each other and use human heads for decoration.</blockquote>



---

It's easy to miss the uniting theme, and thus call it "not a novel" or whatever, because it only unmasks on p.791. It is Ares v Athena, rage v cunning, politics v engineering, normies v geeks, law v ethics, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/">conflict v mistake</a>, local maxima v the search for the global. This overloaded binary is embodied in Andrew v Randy, the Dentist v Avi, Rudy v Göring, All of Japan v Dengo.

Now, it suits me to have litigious bastards and culture-warriors be the inheritors of Ares, of mindless destruction. But it would be silly to think that the stakes are comparable between the plot strands: it's WWII vs the Struggles of Some Cool Crypto Entrepreneurs. But Stephenson is obviously not equating them, and might be pointing out that stakes are now in general lower, even when you're up against contemporary gangsters.

Another giant theme is the emergence of one new masculinity, beyond the taciturn physical hero: the geek. This is the "third category" above. (Is this really that new? Isn't it just the Scholar?)

Misc notes

* Waterhouse seems to be taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Tutte">Bill Tutte</a>'s space in history and seizing it for America but ok.

* Bobby Shaftoe is the noblest junkie character I've ever seen - ingenious in his pursuit of morphine, but slightly more keen on Marine honour than on it.

* I was not expecting Stephenson to use converting to Christianity as the symbol for Dengo leaving sick ultranationalism behind. Compassion and liberalism are far larger and better than the Christian launchpad they happened to use, after all.

* Relatedly there's his preference for cute family-values Christianity over postmodern critical theory:

<blockquote>To translate it into UNIX system administration terms (Randy’s fundamental metaphor for just about everything), the post-modern, politically correct atheists were like people who had suddenly found themselves in charge of a big and unfathomably complex computer system (viz, society) with no documentation or instructions of any kind, and so whose only way to keep the thing running was to invent and enforce certain rules with a kind of neo-Puritanical rigor, because they were at a loss to deal with any deviations from what they saw as the norm. Whereas people who were wired into a church were like UNIX system administrators who, while they might not understand everything, at least had some documentation, some FAQs and How-tos and README files, providing some guidance on what to do when things got out of whack. </blockquote>



* Some surprisingly deft notes on kink and the exogenous/preconscious nature of sexuality, in the bit where they're spying on Tom Howard.

* This line accurately portrays the mindset of certain wizard types like Turing:

<blockquote>It is exciting to discover electrons and figure out the equations that govern their movement; it is boring to use those principles to design electric can openers.</blockquote>


though it is discreditable and nongeneralisable to hold.

* I learned a lot of words. 

* There are dozens and dozens of depictions of Japanese war crimes before we get any note paid to the horrendous suffering of the Japanese troops. But after that it is suitably even-handed in its tragedy. One of the saddest sentences I've ever read: "They are strafing the survivors".

* Root is a tech determinist about the war - the Allies won because their tech was better, end-of. I seriously doubt historians would go with this. 

* <spoiler>I struggle to fit Root into the world. His death and reappearance is the only magical element in the entire thing (coincidences aside), and clashes with the main bloody theme. I am toying with the idea that Root is a collective name like James Bond, but I suppose it'll just be some switcheroo bullshit.</spoiler>

---

There's a lot wrong with it - it's about twice as long as it needs to be, the gender stuff is overdone, it is intentionally annoying to its outgroup, succumbing to 'conflict theory', and none of its antagonists (Loeb, the Dentist, Wing, Crocodile) are fleshed out despite him having 900 pages of opportunities for fleshing them -  but it's grand, clever, full of ideas, funny, full of great setpieces, and foresaw a couple of things about our decade.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73700)">"Distant Neighbors: A Portrait of the Mexicans"</a></h3>

Alan Riding (1989)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2022<br>
<br>
I am not surprised that Riding left Mexico after writing this. The first chapter's brutal generalisations feel like something from the 1930s - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Benedict">Ruth Benedict</a> shit.

<blockquote>Because of the risks involved in defining oneself, most important academic treatises about Mexico have been written by foreigners...

In its soul, Mexico is not—and perhaps never will be — a Western nation. But by trying to make the country more superficially democratic, more Western, more “presentable” abroad, the system’s roots in the population have weakened. It has become less truly democratic because it is less representative of real Mexicans. The more the system responds to the Americanized minority, the more blatant will be the contradictions within the country...

more evident than in Mexico’s almost aggressive sense of nationalism. The threats, attacks, invasions and occupations that have come from abroad since the time of Independence are more than sufficient to justify Mexico’s unspoken xenophobia... Feeling imprisoned historically and economically by the United States, Mexico has used a series of lesser political issues as loudspeakers for its nationalism. Its strong influence over local media and the discipline of its political apparatus enable the government to switch on nationalist “shows” at its convenience: issues that in one year become tests of national honor may be ignored the next year. Major “victories” have therefore been recorded on problems of little consequence to the United States and of great symbolic weight to Mexico... A drought that severely damaged Mexican agriculture in 1980 was attributed by some officials to hurricane seeding by the U.S. National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration. On this occasion, embarrassed Mexican diplomats conceded privately that the nationalism was misplaced and the media “show” had taken off on its own. The following year, no credit was given to the United States for an excellent rainy season.


Mexico alone is truly mestizo: it is the only nation in the hemisphere where religious and political—as well as racial—mestizaje took place; it has the only political system that must be understood in a pre-Hispanic context; and its inhabitants alone are still more Oriental than Western</blockquote>


Some ridiculous apophasis too:

<blockquote>Conversely, the wife, who as an object of sex is considered an aberration from feminine perfection, must be humiliated, since a husband’s faithfulness or excessive affection would imply vulnerability and weakness

Whether or not this neo-Freudian analysis is wholly valid, the male-female relationship in Mexico is often marked by tension and distrust.</blockquote>



I wondered how he could keep up this level of English disdain for 500 pages but he rights himself and goes on to give a good, value-laden potted history of 3000 years of the territory. Big focus on incredible inequalities and "internal colonialism".

Dozens of remarkable details, like the folk hero Pancho Villa <a href="https://lithub.com/the-forgotten-massacre-of-chinese-immigrants-during-the-mexican-revolution/">slaughtering Chinese civilians</a>; or the left populist Echerverria who killed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Dirty_War">hundreds</a> of leftists.

<blockquote>soon became apparent that much of the crime, in the main holdups and kidnappings, was being carried out in Mexico City by current and former members of the local police

on numerous occasions each year, politicians—men and women—will line up for hours in the hope of receiving an abrazo from the President.

the INI moved to recover direct control over Maya, Tarahumara, Mixtec and Nahuatl radio stations thought to be too independent.

Given the fatalism of the Indians and the repression prevailing throughout the country, revolution could only begin in the middle classes.

Today, Mexicans resent the arrogance of many Spanish migrants, with their well-earned reputation for “exploiting” local workers, but they feel drawn to all things Spanish, from singers and bullfighters to food and wines. At a national level, even though Mexico is today richer, more populous and more influential than Spain, it continues to look, perhaps subconsciously, for the mother country’s approval.</blockquote>


I am surprised the PRI was so successful at suppressing the church:

<blockquote>In 1992, Salinas restored Mexico’s diplomatic relations with the Vatican and relaxed controls on church activities. For the first time in seventy-five years, the clergy stopped being official pariahs.</blockquote>



He claims that the anti-Americanism was actually just an elite thing not shared by the populace (until 1990, when the elites started to kowtow):

<blockquote>There is resentment bequeathed by the loss of so much territory in the nineteenth century and by U.S. military interventions as recently as 1916. There is resistance to the oppressive weight of continuing U.S. political and economic influence in Mexico. There is intellectualized contempt for the materialistic culture exported by the United States. And there is the reassuring belief that “clever” Mexicans can always outwit “naïve” Americans. But among ordinary Mexicans there is also admiration for the United States and, above all, for its organization, honesty and affluence.</blockquote>



Overall, tragedy piled haphazardly on tragedy.

<blockquote>the country’s own historical record of defeats and betrayals has prepared Mexicans to expect — and accept — the worst. The official heroes — from Cuauhtémoc to Emiliano Zapata—have invariably been murdered, while the ideals enshrined in laws and constitutions have been universally betrayed. “The hero’s tomb is the cradle of the people,” the poet Octavio Paz</blockquote>



This was risible:

<blockquote>[The US is separated by] language, religion, race, philosophy and history. The United States is a nation barely two hundred years old and is lunging for the twenty-first century. Mexico is several thousand years old and is still held back by its past.</blockquote>


A classic mistake, forgetting that nation-states are very new and simply not identical with their geography. (In what sense is the current administration or population the same as that of the Olmecs?)

This was wrong at the time:

<blockquote>No former colony with a large indigenous population has ever climbed out of underdevelopment. No valid blueprint exists, no improvised plans seem to work. Even if Mexico’s political system survives in its present form, its managers harbored few illusions that the country’s deep social problems would be resolved before the year 2000: optimistically, it might resemble Greece; pessimistically, it will be more like India</blockquote>


(Canada.) Chile is now above a reasonable definition of middle-income, but this is mostly growth since 2000.

A Cold War book. Mexico is a different country now, more different than most countries 40 years on.

Some slang:

* "Priista": member of the PRI, previously the dictator party.
* "mordida": bite, small routine bribe
* "cacique": boss, chief, in particular the monopsonist exploiter of rural workers.
* "chingadazo is a heavy physical blow, and a chingadera is a dirty trick. A Mexican can warn, jokingly or threateningly, no chingues, meaning “don’t annoy me,” and if he loses out in some way, he will admit that me chingaron. It is high praise to describe someone as chingón—that is, he is clever enough to chingar others"

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64341)">"The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect"</a></h3>

Roger    Williams (2003)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2022<br>
<br>
I've been judging this book as a debate partner - as if it was real (hard sci-fi), when in fact it has many fantasy elements: <spoiler>The infinite magic quantum energy, the apparently viable human population from one bloody pair, ...</spoiler>. This is an involuntary compliment! 

It's better than ordinary fiction in some ways (rawer, less constrained by taste), worse in some (pornified). It's like a prototype of 'ratfic'. Like Brave New World but about a million times more intense: a long sordid argument against Asimov's three laws and transhumanism. (Williams himself is not into primitivism, but his book sure is.)

Take the content warning seriously for once: lot of horrible shit in it. As ever with horror, the chief nastiness is not the gore or maiming or corpse-shagging, but the misanthropy, moral degradation, and existential doom those things highlight.
<spoiler>

<blockquote>The dirt and grass whizzed by her so fast it was nothing but a blur, so fast that she had no time to see the hazards which caused bruises and cuts to collect on her like bird droppings on a seldom-washed car.</blockquote>


</spoiler>
Caroline, the protagonist for most of the book, is a failure. She isn't wise after 600 years. She isn't mindful, she doesn't manage to construct meaning out of her (admittedly ultra weird) life. She's only able to find meaning by doing the opposite of what the AI god wants: her seeking maximum abuse. Her one virtue is cussedness: to nurse resentful resistance for centuries, to never ever sell out, to do the most vile and self-destructive things out of spite, to remember what full freedom is and demand it. 

Her conception of meaning is that choices need to be permanent to be meaningful, that meaning is the destruction of measure, so that I am a <a href="<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4395554366?utm_medium=email&utm_source=like_notification&ref_=pe_7171740_475446060">">philosophical vampire</a> to other timelines. This is a sad and hopefully surmountable way of seeing the world.

It is one of the better depictions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misaligned_goals_in_artificial_intelligence">misalignment</a>. (It's an uncrowded field.) Certainly a good depiction of how "90% aligned" is still <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/more-realistic-tales-of-doom">terrible</a>. (Keywords: value lock-in, leaky abstractions, human alignment, Nearest Unblocked Neighbor, corrigibility, strong evaluation.) Even if you could implement Asimov's laws, it still wouldn't save you. (Asimov knew this, but a surprising number of scientists still don't.) 

Aside from that, if you are a paternalist in ordinary matters and don't see why everyone is against you, this might show you.

Even so I distrust this book: it is in love with extremes. There is no word on how the trillions and trillions of other people live. There is only the rage and sadism of the 100 most monstrous and maladapted: "infinitely masturbating vegetables, Death Jockeys, and discorporate entities". Williams shows no one learning anything with the help of their god-teacher. (In passing he also mentions that people don't see the point in researching anything, that scientists ran out of questions to ask PI within a month. But the mathematicians never will! And nor the literary critics.) I view this as a profound failure of spirit: his society has far less ability to produce its own goals and meaning than the average 6 year old.

I agree with Williams that videogames, or rather the grand and unprecedented artform that succeeds them, will take over from work in the post-scarcity world. I agree that a tiny number of people will want snuff and degradation and horrorshows from them.


<spoiler>Were they right to crash Prime Intellect? On one side: trillions and trillions of lives lost. On the other: one woman's quest for authenticity and woodsmanship. (One way of making sense of Caroline's reroll is to assume that the steady state of the PI world is that every human will buckle after millennia and lose all sense - and that the PI would be maintaining trillions of fully dissociated unreasoning bundles forever. Catatonia as replacement for death. But even then it's far from clear, just as Williams intentionally leaves it unclear if the aliens were put back. [I bet not.])
</spoiler>

Williams just worries about the march of technology, and this book is him entertaining the hypothesis that we are losing the main thing of value about us: authenticity, agency, struggle, transience. But it entertains it really hard. 
<spoiler>
There was nothing we couldn't have for the asking. There was nothing we couldn't do. Nothing could ever hurt us." She coughed again. "It was fucking boring."
Their eyes met.
"It was the worst thing ever. Nothing mattered. Not pain, not accomplishments, not anything."</spoiler>

<a href="https://www.gleech.org/culture">Iain Banks struggled with this theme a lot</a>, and I was no more convinced by his treatment.
<spoiler>"It was surprising how many things one took for granted until one had to make them from scratch. The value of a needle and a few meters of thread, for example, had taken on a significance Lawrence would have found incomprehensible for most of his life... kind of contentment he had never even realized was possible."

The book ends with Caroline, destroyer of worlds, setting up an incestuous tribe of nontechnological offspring, mandating all the struggles of early humanity, in a doomed attempt</spoiler>

Plus one star for conceptual clarity, hammering on its mistaken argument all the way to the end of the line. Minus one for being simplistic where its author is not.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156785)">"Diaspora"</a></h3>

Greg Egan (2000)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2022<br>
<br>
Does three things unusually well: hardness, alterity, and scale. Maybe uniquely well. Unfortunately these are not enough for a great book. 

Hard. For years I’ve wanted to write actually hard science fiction. Stuff like computing a full dynamical model of each plotline and space trajectory. Hard budget for delta-v. Deriving counterfactual physics from strange axioms. Showing the crucial moments in the plot, and quantifying their crucialness. 

Egan has done basically this in Diaspora, but he goofed by including much of his model in the prose (where I was going to hide it away on github). Probably about a quarter of this book is physics and physicslike exposition.

<blockquote>The classical properties of a fermion were having a spin of half a unit, obeying the Pauli exclusion principle (which kept all the electrons in an atom, and neutrons and protons in a nucleus, from falling together into the same, lowest-energy state), and responding to a 360-degree rotation by slipping 180 degrees out of phase with its unrotated version. A fermion needed two full rotations, 720 degrees, to come back into phase. Bosons needed only one rotation to end up exactly as they began.

Any long particle made up of an odd number of individual fermions would retain the first two fermionic properties, but if it also included any bosons, their presence would show up in the pattern of phase changes when the particle was rotated. A long particle with a wormhole sequence of "fermion-boson-fermion-fermion" would go out of phase and back like a simple fermion after one and two rotations, but a third rotation would bring it back into phase again immediately. Successive rotations could probe the wormhole's structure at ever greater depths: for each individual fermion in the chain it would take two rotations to restore the particle's phase, while for each boson it would take just one.</blockquote>



<spoiler>the characters leave spacetime to transit in higher dimensional realms, then leave that higher realm, then leave that one. They make this ascent trillions of times.</spoiler>

<blockquote>“It was meaningless to ask how many universes each handful of vacuum here contained. The Handler's revelations meant that even in the home universe, there were an infinite number of levels below them.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“They [fast-forwarded time] for a millennium”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“They granted themselves eight-dimensional senses, and sat on the girders of an 8-scaped Satellite Pinatubo, watching perpendicular pairs of slender three- and five- dimensional artifacts rotate in and out of view. It was like whirling around a spiral staircase running from macrosphere to macrosphere, dimension to dimension”</blockquote>



<spoiler>

<blockquote>“Taken together, the artifacts comprised a giant sculpture, spanning more than a quadrillion dimensions. The Transmuters had built a structure that dwarfed universes, but touched each one only lightly”</blockquote>


</spoiler>

Alterity. It's one of the few depictions of posthumans that makes you want to be there. The hints of their art we see are way beyond ours. It's a libertarian paradise, where rights are enforced at the OS level. There's no antagonist as a result. Physics, mathematics, and the relation of computation to meaning are the great challenges. 

I liked the political struggle between escapists and starfarers, metaphysicians and positivists. <spoiler> in the end even the positivists sort of become escapists, by finding the natural em carpets and by ascending away from the original reality.</spoiler>

<blockquote>"we choose to value the physical world. That's what defines us, but it's as arbitrary as any other choice of values. Why can't you accept that? It's not the One True Path which the infidels have to be bludgeoned into following.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Everything goes on in a multidimensional frequency space. I've Fourier-transformed the edge into over a thousand components, and there's independent information in all of them. We're only in a narrow cross section here, a sixteen-dimensional slice—but it's oriented to show the principal components, the maximum detail."
Paolo spun in a blur of meaningless color, utterly lost, his surroundings beyond comprehension. "You're a gleisner robot, Karpal! Only sixteen dimensions! How can you have done this?"
Karpal sounded hurt, wherever he was. "Why do you think I came to C-Z? I thought you people were flexible!"
"What you're doing is…" What? Heresy? There was no such thing. Officially. "Have you shown this to anyone else?"
"Of course not. Who did you have in mind? Liesl? Hermann?"
"Good. I know how to keep my mouth shut." Paolo jumped back to the dodecahedron; Karpal followed. "How can I put this? The physical universe has three spatial dimensions, plus time. Citizens of Carter-Zimmerman inhabit the physical universe. The false promises of Kozuch Theory kept us from the stars for a thousand years. Higher-dimensional mind games are strictly for the solipsists...

Paolo felt himself being tempted. Inhabit a sixteen dimensional slice of a thousand-dimensional frequency space? But it was in the service of understanding a real physical system—not a novel experience for its own sake.
And nobody had to find out.
He ran a quick self-predictive model. There was a ninety-three percent chance that he'd give in, after a kilotau spent agonizing over the decision.</blockquote>




Scale. The second half of the book just doesn't stop escalating. Some of the ems live for millions of years subjective, billions objective. <spoiler>Each neutron is used to store vast amounts of data, more than we store on our planet of hard drives. They visit dozens of worlds and then trillions of dimensions. Until they are perfectly alone, until the milky way is dead.</spoiler>

---

* It has a very strong philosophy of science, underdetermination:

<blockquote>Blanca accepted that it was possible that all of Kozuch Theory's successful predictions were due to nothing but the "mirroring" of the logical structure of wormhole topology in another system altogether. The motion under gravity of an object dropped down a borehole passing through the center of an asteroid obeyed essentially the same mathematics as the motion of an object tied to the free end of an idealized anchored spring—but pushing either model too far as a metaphor for the other generated nonsense. The success of Kozuch's model could be due to the fact that it was just an extremely good metaphor, most of the time, for some deeper physical process which was actually as different from extra-dimensional wormholes as a spring was different from an asteroid.</blockquote>




* Egan is modish, anti-growth:

<blockquote>Fleshers used to spin fantasies about aliens arriving to 'conquer' Earth, to steal their 'precious' physical resources, to wipe them out for fear of 'competition'… as if a species capable of making the journey wouldn't have had the power, or the wit, or the imagination, to rid itself of obsolete biological imperatives. Conquering the galaxy is what bacteria with spaceships would do—knowing no better, having no choice.

Our condition is the opposite of that: we have no end of choices. That's why we need to find another spacefaring civilization. Understanding Lacerta is important, the astrophysics of survival is important, but we also need to speak to others who've faced the same decisions, and discovered how to live, what to become. We need to understand what it means to inhabit the universe.</blockquote>




* <spoiler>In passing he solves Fermi: they’ve all gone to the second macrosphere for some reason, two dimensions rotated away from us.</spoiler>

* Paolo is a moody bastard who never grows. Many such cases. Also he’s one of the only sims to have gender; even his dad, who was born biological, ends up using the neuter “ve”.

<blockquote>Ve stared down into the expanding well. "I'm doing this because of some badly-chosen fields in my mind seed. What's your excuse?"
Paolo didn't reply.
Yatima looked up. "Well, you should be good company”</blockquote>


But this stubborn stasis is exactly what he needs for his plotline, <spoiler>what it takes to be one of the few appreciators of the greatest artwork possible, to remain himself over 90 billion years</spoiler>.

* I love "bridging", his depiction of how to do first contact: you produce a clone of yourself who is less like you, more like the alien. You repeat this process n times until the nth clone can communicate with the alien and their n-1, who explains it to n-2…

<blockquote>There was a world where that being had lived… but ve could neither name it nor clearly imagine it. With the symbols gone for most of the original's episodic memories, the clone's strongest inheritance was a sense of urgency, yet the edges of the lost memories still ached, like the vestiges of some plotless, senseless, unrecoverable dream of love and belonging.</blockquote>



* The emotional heft of having a clone, and reintegrating them:

<blockquote>“I'll merge with you. If you really are willing."
Orlando examined his strange twin's face, wondering if he was being mocked, or tested. "I'm willing. Are you sure it's what you want, though? When I merge with the other thousand, what will a few megatau of your experience in 5-scapes amount to?"
"Not much," the clone conceded. "A tiny wound. A subtle ache. A reminder that you once embraced something larger than you thought you could."
"You want me to find sanctuary, and still be dissatisfied?"
"Just a bit."
"You want me to dream in five dimensions?"
"Now and then.”</blockquote>



* Egan is genuinely successful at making em relationships romantic:

<blockquote>Paolo took the responsibilities of intimacy seriously; his lover before Elena had asked him to erase all his knowledge of her, and he'd more or less complied the only thing he still knew about her was the fact that she'd made the request.

Paolo brushed the dew from his skin. "Can I hold you in my mind? Just below sentience? Just to keep me sane?"
Elena sighed with mock wistfulness. "Of course, my love! Take a lock of my mind on your journey, and I'll carry a lock of yours on mine."</blockquote>

Nick Harkaway (2017)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2022<br>
<br>
Aims for Eco and Calvino, hits Nolan and Stross. Unsugared mind candy. About twice as long as it should be. 

How do you have a horror film when the characters have mobiles? How do you have a whodunnit when the entire world is on camera? What if you automated totalitarianism, and it somehow actually made almost everyone safe and happy? Gnomon is a well-executed mistake.

I loved the initial Kyriakos (the Greek debt crisis of 2009 dramatised; the right kind of conspiracy thinking) and Athanasai segments; initially it felt like Cloud Atlas but irreverent and stronger at sentence level. The depiction of the Athenian mob is extremely acute. But the second half ruins it. <spoiler>The Erebus section attempts the awesome energy of DOOM but is somehow just dull</spoiler>.

In spending so much time in the head of an intentionally obscure novelist / conspirator, Harkaway has the perfect excuse to go full hog on the idiocy and hallucinations of semiotics, the maniac idea that puns and etymologies reveal Reality. The constant repetition of a few abstruse ideas is meant to be a profound weave but it's just boring. Catabasis torn gnomon gnomon gnomon. But a lot of the SHEER DETAIL is actually cool, not just the usual tired mythic icons: a measured account of how collateralised debt obligations are unfairly demonised, a Space Truckers reference, details of St Augustine's youth. It would be fine if the central symmetries were less contrived. (All of these four people... have at some point been in a small room!!) So I can't avoid mentioning Dan Brown can I, even if Harkaway's prose is suspended entirely above that. 

<spoiler>Another main weakness is the facelessness of the metaphysical villains, Harkway's paranoia, which is a common paranoia. Fascists take Britain, Greece, Ethiopia. Fascists are lurking behind everything. They subvert the police and MI5 somehow.</spoiler>

It's very romantic, underneath the verbal pyrotechnics. We know that the panopticon state is wrong before anything goes actually wrong because it is sterile. The jumbled literary rebellion of Hunter (Diana! geddit) is portrayed as enough to shake the totalitarian. Neith is sterile too: even her scepticism and openmindedness are tame and ultimately help close her off.

One brilliant thing is how banal the mindrape technicians are. Like Brazil except without Gilliam's gurning and cartoonish sensibilities.

The pareidolia proliferation pogo can be great - Labatut or Delillo, Ghost in the Shell.

The main problem is that Lipovaca spends so long on syntax and basic procedural stuff that you barely get a favour of what's distinctive about Haskell, type inference. But then the monads chapter is the best there is.

Oddly unaffecting - I loved What If?, and this follows a very similar formula, but it's flatter somehow, the understatement less funny, the maths less astonishing.

The few chapters where he starts with a ridiculous naive approach (e.g. ski by dragging a train of liquid nitrogen which you spray in your path) and then iterates until he gets to the existing technology (roller skates) are satisfying. Chris Hadfield's nerd-chic understatement is funny, but that's probably just because of who he is.

Vinge is without peer at two things:

Neal Stephenson (2000)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Dec 2020<br>
<br>
Amazed that this is from 1995; its concerns feel very current - too current. The nations of the world collapse from cryptocurrency destroying the tax base; they are replaced with <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Polystate-Thought-Experiment-Distributed-Government-ebook/dp/B00IM5EM7W">voluntary</a> <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/">ideological associations</a>, including trads ("neo-Victorians" and techno-Confucians) who are shown thriving where others suffer civil war, state failure, and ordinary poverty and abuse. Everyone has fancy nanotechnology, which solves absolute poverty and allows massive structures to be built of solid diamond.

That's all in the background, where the foreground is a theory of education and rebellion, of social degeneration and regeneration. The leader of the Victorians designs the best educational game ever, a 12-year-long adventure game with live narration. He does this because there's a shortage of subversion and rebellion in his society, and he wants to train his granddaughter to be independent. (He also says the neo-Vickys have an associated shortage of great artists, but to put it mildly this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Victorian_novelists">not something</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_artists#Born_1800%E2%80%931899">the originals</a> suffered.)

In particular, Stephenson was <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html">a bit</a> obsessed with moral relativism in the 90s; he harps on the superiority of realism, or communitarianism, or status regulation, or sincerity, or something, in most of his books. Superficially, his concern matches one annoying strain of internet writing of the last few years - the clickbait strawmaneering of the Petersons and the Lindsays. But French Theory <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/french-thought-once-dazzled-the-world-what-went-wrong">fell</a> in the meantime, outside of a few academic subcultures with little influence, so Stephenson can be right while these guys are wrong. An excess of scepticism and irony - a deficit of shaming and judgment - does not strike me as the first problem with the mores of 2020.

Stephenson saves most of the nice bits of the book for the Vickys, and his attempt to recover what was good about the original Victorians (their energy, inventiveness, duty, taste) ignores a lot of what was bad about them. (Though he actively endorses their hypocrisy about sex, he would have to think again about their betraying their Christian universalism with retributive justice and imperialism.)

<blockquote>
"when I was a young man, hypocrisy was deemed the worst of vices," Finkle-McGraw said. "It was all because of moral relativism. You see, in that sort of a climate, you are not allowed to criticise others--after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism?...

"Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others' shortcomings. And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices. For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what he has espoused with what he has actually done... Virtually all political discourse in the days of my youth was devoted to the ferreting out of hypocrisy."

"That we occasionally violate our own stated moral code," Major Napier said, working it through, "does not imply that we are insincere in espousing that code." 
"Of course not," Finkle-McGraw said. "It's perfectly obvious, really. No one ever said that it was easy to hew to a strict code of conduct."
</blockquote>



Having "Victorian" characters means he gets to have fun with his dialogue; there are dozens of words I've never seen before in this, and several children crafting exquisitely balanced subordinate clauses.

About a third too long, and that's with him completely truncating the excellent Judge Fang plotline. As always, he is incapable of writing a good ending. Maybe 4 stars on re-read.

<br>
<blockquote>You're all going home with self-help books
Hidden behind Heat because you're worried about the looks
And you know there is no shame
Because we're all doing the same</blockquote>

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwCshqX75xk">Malcolm Middleton</a>

<blockquote>...yet another book about making the best use of time. But it is written in the belief that time management as we know it has failed miserably, and that we need to stop pretending otherwise</blockquote>

- Burkeman

A good defence of quietism, and an actually tasteful self-help book. Still completely unconvincing. I’ll never accept this orientation to life, but I appreciate someone doing it well, and I can even see it as an improvement over the default attitude.

Burkeman was the Guardian’s self-help guru. His job consisted in being tasteful, laundering the insights of dodgy thinkers, making self-help palatable for the upper-middle classes. Here he sprinkles Heidegger and Bergson over much the same porridge of Covey and Ferriss and the secular prosperity gospel. He has the standard list of culprits: industrial standardisation, Calvinism, capitalism, but also egocentric bias.

Premises:

* Medieval peasants were "connected to deep time" and so not anxious like us.
* Work isn't sufficient for a meaningful life
* Work expands to maintain you at your limit
* You should let the size of the universe make you less ambitious ("cosmic insignificance therapy")

---

Why not go for his mindful quietism? 

Burkeman's philosophy is healthier than the default one and still very sickly. 'Surrender! We are time. We are attention. We kill lives whenever we choose.'

But he’s asking us to feel small, to be small. If you are small, it behooves you to adjust your self-image. But it is surprisingly easy to be large, to save lives and all that.

* It’s not enough for me to object that we will eventually solve aging. Even in the posthuman future we will die, even if it’s four billion weeks and not four thousand. The essential morbidity and anxiety will remain, just diluted many times over.

The cosmos doesn't care about me? I don't care that the cosmos doesn't care! Recall <a href="https://outofcontextsite.wordpress.com/2015/10/10/frank-ramsey-on-why-its-reasonable-to-be-cheerful/">Ramsey</a>, a greater sage than any cited by Burkeman:

<blockquote>The stars may be large, but they cannot think or love; and these are qualities which impress me far more than size does...

My picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The foreground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny bits. </blockquote>




Laundering spiritualism, phenomenology, psychoanalysis, the dao. Dodgy thinkers like Jung and Krishnamurti
Peck

There’s a bit about the Mumford anti-industry mindset. (Were peasants bored? No, they had nothing better to do. Were they generally connected to deep time? Doubt it.)

Consider also 80,000 Hours.

The position is something like: Things are meaningful in proportion to the measure they destroy.
This position amuses me. Like I am a vampire of other timelines. Like actuality is a gross assimilator, harvesting measure.

He says that infinite beautiful summers with your family is worse than a finite number. But this is direct contradiction with his mindfulness-as-condition-of-value position! If you can actually be present, what does it matter what number of other summers there are?

Things which actually persuaded me

Against extreme option brain

---

Task-orientation as odd and contingent industrial invention:

<blockquote>Each hour or week or year is like a container being carried on the belt, which we must fill as it passes, if we’re to feel that we’re making good use of our time. When there are too many activities to fit comfortably into the containers, we feel unpleasantly busy; when there are too few, we feel bored. If we keep pace with the passing containers, we congratulate ourselves for “staying on top of things” and feel like we’re justifying our existence; if we let too many pass by unfilled, we feel we’ve wasted them. </blockquote>


Assembly lines for the human soul.

---

I like Burkeman. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/04/oliver-burkemans-last-column-the-eight-secrets-to-a-fairly-fulfilled-life">He made himself redundant</a> and admitted it, and when has a newspaperman ever done that? And even if he is facetious about embarrassing low-status topics, that's one up on people who never manage to work on them.

Reading this proved to be pretty rich for me, but almost entirely because he’s clearly wrong about me and mine.

<br>
I'm not into horror or surrealism, and I'm only just learning the visual vocabulary of manga, but this is well-executed. Placenta fungi, pregnant zombies, horny hurricanes, gangs using tornados for vandalism, humans becoming fair game, all that. But these garish wonders are secondary to the grossness and power of Ito's atmosphere.

The protagonist Mikie is frustratingly passive and ineffectual - she waits for 10 distinct monstrous things to happen before running away - but this is a classic shortcoming / genre requirement and I don't know how I'd write a powerful horror protagonist myself. The boyfriend, Shuichi, understands everything right from the start, unlike her, and yet he is no better.

There's a few beautiful colour pages, all in pastels, but it makes the rest look incomplete. The price of a weekly medium.

So, a masterpiece in an alien language.

Ken MacLeod (2002)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2021<br>
<br>
Remarkable book, mining Marxism’s great SF potential at last. Deeply politically incorrect somehow. I skipped Macleod until now, assuming that I already had the Scottish radical SF angle from Banks. But this is completely different. It’s detailed and tragic and filled with left self-sabotage. Clearly written by someone who has spent one too many evenings in vitriolic, pedantic, and useless Organising meetings.

<blockquote>Stone hauled a tattered tabloid from the inside of his jacket and spread it on the table.
‘Red Star,’ Stone said. ‘It’s a bit extreme, but some of the things they say make sense. Thought you might be interested, Moh.’
Does it show? Kohn wondered wildly. Is there some mark of Cain branded on my forehead that identifies me to everybody else, no matter what I say or don’t say, no matter how much I want to put it all behind me? He picked the paper up reluctantly, took his shades off to read. There it was, the banner with the strange device: a hammer-and-sickle, facing the opposite way from the traditional Soviet one, with a ‘4’ over the hammer.
He didn’t read beyond the masthead.
‘The only red stars I know about,’ he said, ‘are dead, off the main sequence, and consist mostly of faintly glowing gas.</blockquote>



Why Marxist fiction (and not Marxist politics)?: the grand conflicts, the frustrated utopian futurism, the sweat and blood, the technology-first view of history. And also a lot of literary potential in the dwarfed, self-defeating, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communist_parties_in_Nepal">famously speciated</a> real-life cadres. Macleod includes aching details about British leftist culture - calling your parents by their first name, Levi jackets as some kind of statement, the pompous set phrases of resistance ("comrades, this is no accident"), the paranoid tint the whole world takes when history is your foe. I miss the sincerity and spurious clarity, the cussed, blessed obliviousness to which century it is.

<blockquote>The lunchtime crowd was so noisy she no longer noticed it, nor the wall-covering black-and-white portraits of Lech Walesa and Nelson Mandela and Winston Churchill and Bobby Sands and Wei Jingshen and others to whose memory various factions had successively dedicated the place…

Others moved through the shadows of the trees around him and he recognized them, the old comrades, the dead on leave: John Ball in his rough robe, Winstanley building a hut in a clearing, Tom Paine slipping him a wink as he and Blake stepped over the sleeping Bunyan; Harvey and Jones, Eleanor Marx and Morris….</blockquote>



<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210114010028/https://c4ss.org/content/13053">The foreword</a> is essential reading - KM reveals himself to be a rare bird, a leftist who understands the dreadful force of Mises’ calculation argument.

<blockquote>Unfortunately, there’s no reason why the Economic Calculation Argument and the Materialist Conception of History couldn’t both be true. What if capitalism is unstable, and socialism is impossible? </blockquote>



As a result, the main conflict in this is not socialism vs capitalism (the ancap zone is the nicest place in the book) but progress vs primitivism and resistance vs (American and UN) empire

<blockquote>There were times when Kohn loathed the Left, when some monstrous stupidity almost, but never quite, outweighed the viciousness and venality of the system they opposed. Ally with the barbarians against the patricians and praetorians… think again, proletarians!… His co-op had lived by defending what he still saw as the seeds of progress – the workers’ organizations and the scientists and, if necessary, the capitalists – against the enemies of that modern industry on which all their conflicting hopes relied…

(She’d often wondered just what molecule or compound was responsible for hysteria and ineducability in the middle classes: it must have seeped into the food-chain sometime in the nineteen-sixties, and become ever more concentrated since.)

‘Fuck them and their nazi economics.’ He punched his palm. ‘Protection. Conservation. Restriction. Deep ecology. Give me deep technology any day. They don’t scare me. I’m damned if I’ll crawl, my children’s children crawl on the earth in some kind a fuckin harmony with the environment.

…a permanent party – in both senses, an occasion and an organization of the privileged</blockquote>



The OTT cynicism about the UN here contrasts well with the soppy treatment of the last fictional UN I encountered (Ada Palmer’s wise ancient saviour order).

The antagonists are done well. They're actually fighting to prevent billions of people dying, and their plan is <spoiler>actually the exact same as the one executed by The Gun deus ex machina. They also have some sense of AI x-risk, unlike the happy go lucky protagonists.</spoiler>

The AI stuff is good, and the antagonists are suitably scared of it. <spoiler>The expert system architecture is quaint but he did his best. The death of the AI civilisation, billions of apparently sentient and highly enhanced minds is not treated very seriously, not half as seriously as losing Moh alone. But I suppose they are easier to redo than humans.</spoiler>
Yep:

<blockquote> the whole [AI] rumour was so apocalyptic that she had difficulty crediting it could really happen in her own lifetime. She knew this was exactly how people would feel just before the real apocalypse, that nearly everyone who’d faced some intrusive threat to their everyday existence – war, revolution, genocide, purges, disaster – had faced it with the firm conviction that things like this just didn’t happen or didn’t happen here or didn’t happen to people like them. But she also knew there would be no end of false alarms, lying wonders, false prophets with a Lo! here and a Hi! there, before whatever the real thing was came along. Indeed, they were part of the reason why the real thing always came like a thief in the night or… like a secret policeman in the early hours of the morning. </blockquote>



There are limits to Macleod’s scepticism. Trotsky looms large here as a wise prophet (never mind his own peasant-murdering and purely opportunistic democratic pivot).

<blockquote>‘I can see the bright green strip of grass beneath the wall, and a clear blue sky above the wall, and sunlight everywhere. Life is beautiful. Let the future generations cleanse it of all evil, oppression and violence, and enjoy it to the full.’
The gentle words, harshly spoken in a polyglot accent, made Kohn’s eyes sting.
‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘We haven’t done very well.’
The Old Man laughed. ‘You are not the future! You – you are only the present.’</blockquote>


<spoiler>And the revolution wins, brutal and repressive as it instantly becomes.</spoiler>

Also notable for a negative portrayal of Archipelago, voluntary ideological nations with exit rights. The only real critique is that they war on each other all the time (millions of deaths a year), and indoctrinate their subjects so that people don’t exercise their exit rights. Looking at real-life migration patterns in the face of violent borders, few authoritarian regimes have so far managed to indoctrinate so successfully.

<blockquote> New Situationists, Alternative Luddites (they wore space-rigger gear and blew up wind-power plants), Christianarchists, cranks, creeps, commies, tories – all had had their say, in colour.</blockquote>



Macleod is aware that the themes in this 1995 book aged badly in the next decades - revolution lost its hold even among radicals, American hegemony beclowned itself, and the greens took over the left.

<blockquote>And closer to hand, nearer than infinity, she could see the other free wheels turn. Stars and stripes and hammers and sickles flaunted their fading colours to the real stars that held no promises, only hopes and endless, endless lands. </blockquote>


More mind candy than Grand Synthesis, but a strong first novel anyway.

<br>
Important and flawed. It is very hard to think clearly about these things (witness the many inconsistent uses of the term "bias" in the field) but O'Neil goes some way toward this. She is more balanced than average, recognising that algorithms can be an improvement over human bias and pettiness (she praises FICO scores as the liberating thing it was, moving money from those bank managers liked to reliable people of any stripe).

The mass, covert automation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic">business logic</a> in schools, universities, policing, sentencing, recruitment, health, voting... Much to admire: she is a quant (an expert high-stakes modeller) herself, understands the deep potential of modelling, and prefaces her negative examples with examples of great models, methods of math construction.

She was one of the few technically literate people in Occupy:

<blockquote>in mid-2011, when Occupy Wall Street sprang to life in Lower Manhattan, I saw that we had work to do among the broader public. Thousands had gathered to demand economic justice and accountability. And yet when I heard interviews with the Occupiers, they often seemed ignorant of basic issues related to finance...</blockquote>


They were lucky to have her!

Following recent convention, she calls the decision systems 'algorithms'. But it isn't the abstract program that does the harm, but being credulous about their predictions. Programs only do harm when they are allowed to make or guide decisions.

She flip-flops between thinking that false positives are the problem, and that any positives based on uncomfortable variables are the problem.

<blockquote>Predictive models are, increasingly, the tools we will be relying on to run our institutions, deploy our resources, and manage our lives. But as I’ve tried to show throughout this book, these models are constructed not just from data but from the choices we make about which data to pay attention to—and which to leave out. Those choices are not just about logistics, profits, and efficiency. They are fundamentally moral...

Big Data processes codify the past. They do not invent the future. Doing that requires moral imagination, and that’s something only humans can provide. We have to explicitly embed better values into our algorithms, creating models that follow our ethical lead.</blockquote>

She covers most of the objections I would make to a less subtle author:

<blockquote>It is true, as data boosters are quick to point out, that the human brain runs internal models of its own, and they’re often tinged with prejudice or self-interest. So its outputs—in this case, teacher evaluations—must also be audited for fairness. And these audits have to be carefully designed and tested by human beings, and afterward automated. In the meantime, mathematicians can get to work on devising models to help teachers measure their own effectiveness and improve.</blockquote>




She does not include inaccuracy as a named criterion for WMDs, but her discussions sometimes require it. This is maybe the core shortcoming of the book: it doesn't wrestle much with the hard tradeoff involved in when modelling unfair situations, e.g. living in a bad neighbourhood which increases your risks and insurance costs through no fault of your own. She comes down straightforwardly on the direct "make the model pretend it isn't there" diktat. 

But then she notes a case where fairness trumped accuracy and still sucked. "Value-added modelling" of teacher quality:

<blockquote>The teacher scores derived from the tests measured nothing. This may sound like hyperbole. After all, kids took tests, and those scores contributed to Clifford’s. That much is true. But Clifford’s scores, both his humiliating 6 and his chest-thumping 96, were based almost entirely on approximations that were so weak they were essentially random.

The problem was that the administrators lost track of accuracy in their quest to be fair. They understood that it wasn’t right for teachers in rich schools to get too much credit when the sons and daughters of doctors and lawyers marched off toward elite universities. Nor should teachers in poor districts be held to the same standards of achievement. We cannot expect them to perform 1miracles.

So instead of measuring teachers on an absolute scale, they tried to adjust for social inequalities in the model. Instead of comparing Tim Clifford’s students to others in different neighborhoods, they would compare them with forecast models of themselves. The students each had a predicted score. If they surpassed this prediction, the teacher got the credit. If they came up short, the teacher got the blame. If that sounds primitive to you, believe me, it is.</blockquote>




My preferred measure would be to not prevent models from being rational, but instead make transfers to the victims of empirically unfair situation. (This looks pointlessly indirect, but price theory, and the harms of messing with them, is one of the few replicated economic.) My measure has the advantage of not requiring a massive interpretative creep of regulation: you just see what the models do as black boxes and then levy justice taxes after.

<blockquote>Statistically speaking, in these attempts to free the tests from class and color, the administrators moved from a primary to a secondary model. Instead of basing scores on direct measurement of the students, they based them on the so-called error term — the gap between results and expectations. Mathematically, this is a much sketchier proposition. Since the expectations themselves are derived from statistics, these amount to guesses on top of guesses. The result is a model with loads of random results, what statisticians call “noise.”</blockquote>

* Standardisation - the agreement of units and interfaces that everyone can use - is one of those boring but absolutely vital and inspiring human achievements. WMDs are a dark standardisation.

* In her account, a model doesn't have to be predatory to be a WMD: for instance the recidivism estimator was first formulated by a public-spirited gent.

* She says "efficiency" when she often means "accuracy, and thereby efficiency". This makes sense rhetorically, because she doesn't want to give the predatory models a halo effect from the less backhanded word "accurate". Also lards the texts with "Big Data"

* The writer Charles Stross, asked recently to write the shortest possible horror story, responded: "Permanent Transferrable Employee Record". O'Neil makes us consider that this could be easily augmented with "including employee medical histories".

* Surprisingly big evidential gaps:

<blockquote>By 2009, it was clear that the lessons of the market collapse had brought no new direction to the world of finance and had instilled no new values. The lobbyists succeeded, for the most part, and the game remained the same: to rope in dumb money. Except for a few regulations that added a few hoops to jump through, life went on.</blockquote>



* The car crash of American higher education is pretty engrossing. She credits the US News ranking with creating the whole mess though, which can't be right. Certainly it had some effect, and could fix some of its harm by including tuition fee size as a negative factor.

<blockquote>even those who claw their way into a top college lose out. If you think about it, the college admissions game, while lucrative for some, has virtually no educational value. The complex and fraught production simply re-sorts and reranks the very same pool of eighteen-year-old kids in newfangled ways. They don’t master important skills by jumping through many more hoops or writing meticulously targeted college essays under the watchful eye of professional tutors. Others scrounge online for cut-rate versions of those tutors. All of them, from the rich to the working class, are simply being trained to fit into an enormous machine—to satisfy a WMD. And at the end of the ordeal, many of them will be saddled with debt that will take decades to pay off. They’re pawns in an arms race, and it’s a particularly nasty one.</blockquote>



<blockquote>Anywhere you find the combination of great need and ignorance, you’ll likely see predatory ads.


All of these data points were proxies. In his search for financial responsibility, the banker could have dispassionately studied the numbers (as some exemplary bankers no doubt did). But instead he drew correlations to race, religion, and family connections. In doing so, he avoided scrutinizing the borrower as an individual and instead placed him in a group of people — what statisticians today would call a “bucket.” “People like you,” he decided, could or could not be trusted.


Fair and Isaac’s great advance was to ditch the proxies in favor of the relevant financial data, like past behavior with respect to paying bills. They focused their analysis on the individual in question—and not on other people with similar attributes. E-scores, by contrast, march us back in time. They analyze the individual through a veritable blizzard of proxies. In a few milliseconds, they carry out thousands of “people like you” calculations. And if enough of these “similar” people turn out to be deadbeats or, worse, criminals, that individual will be treated accordingly.


From time to time, people ask me how to teach ethics to a class of data scientists. I usually begin with a discussion of how to build an e-score model and ask them whether it makes sense to use “race” as an input in the model. They inevitably respond that such a question would be unfair and probably illegal. The next question is whether to use “zip code.” This seems fair enough, at first. But it doesn’t take long for the students to see that they are codifying past injustices into their model. When they include an attribute such as “zip code,” they are expressing the opinion that the history of human behavior in that patch of real estate should determine, at least in part, what kind of loan a person who lives there should get.


In other words, the modelers for e-scores have to make do with trying to answer the question “How have people like you behaved in the past?” when ideally they would ask, “How have you behaved in the past?” The difference between these two questions is vast. Imagine if a highly motivated and responsible person with modest immigrant beginnings is trying to start a business and needs to rely on such a system for early investment. Who would take a chance on such a person? Probably not a model trained on such demographic and behavioral data.


should note that in the statistical universe proxies inhabit, they often work. More times than not, birds of a feather do fly together. Rich people buy cruises and BMWs. All too often, poor people need a payday loan. And since these statistical models appear to work much of the time, efficiency rises and profits surge. Investors double down on scientific systems that can place thousands of people into what appear to be the correct buckets. It’s the triumph of Big Data.
</blockquote>



Microcosm:

<blockquote>This is not to say that personnel departments across America are intentionally building a poverty trap, much less a racist one. They no doubt believe that credit reports hold relevant facts that help them make important decisions. After all, “The more data, the better” is the guiding principle of the Information Age. Yet in the name of fairness, some of this data should remain uncrunched.</blockquote>

Occasional data-poor hyperbole:

<blockquote>Insurance is an industry that draws on the majority of the community to respond to the needs of an unfortunate minority. In the villages we lived in centuries ago, families, religious groups, and neighbors helped look after each other when fire, accident, or illness struck. In the market economy, we outsource this care to insurance companies, which keep a portion of the money for themselves and call it profit.</blockquote>



Mistaken in the US: the "loss ratio" of US insurance as a whole is greater than 100: loss-making except for financial return on held premiums.

<blockquote>Workers often don’t have a clue about when they’ll be called to work. They are summoned by an arbitrary program.

Scheduling software also creates a poisonous feedback loop. Consider Jannette Navarro. Her haphazard scheduling made it impossible for her to return to school, which dampened her employment prospects and kept her in the oversupplied pool of low-wage workers. The long and irregular hours also make it hard for workers to organize or to protest for better conditions. Instead, they face heightened anxiety and sleep deprivation, which causes dramatic mood swings and is responsible for an estimated 13 percent of highway deaths. Worse yet, since the software is designed to save companies money, it often limits workers’ hours to fewer than thirty per week, so that they are not eligible for company health insurance. And with their chaotic schedules, most find it impossible to make time for a second job. It’s almost as if the software were designed expressly to punish low-wage workers and to keep them down.


The solution for the statisticians at St. George’s—and for those in other industries—would be to build a digital version of a blind audition eliminating proxies such as geography, gender, race, or name to focus only on data relevant to medical education. The key is to analyze the skills each candidate brings to the school, not to judge him or her by comparison with people who seem similar...

we’ve seen time and again that mathematical models can sift through data to locate people who are likely to face great challenges, whether from crime, poverty, or education. It’s up to society whether to use that intelligence to reject and punish them—or to reach out to them with the resources they need. We can use the scale and efficiency that make WMDs so pernicious in order to help people. It all depends on the objective we choose.
</blockquote>



But how do know we what's relevant to medical education, except by correlation discovery?

<blockquote>It would also be a cinch to pump up the income numbers for graduates. All colleges would have to do is shrink their liberal arts programs, and get rid of education departments and social work departments while they’re at it, since teachers and social workers make less money than engineers, chemists, and computer scientists. But they’re no less valuable to society.</blockquote>



This is obvious true on average. But on the margin?

Nice, very simple dynasty story, or, two ends of one with a 50 year jump. From a synopsis you’d think it was saccharine and didactic, but it works. more moving than superficially more extreme treatments like Panorama of Hell. It gets a lot done in 100 pages, with 3 powerful full page panels.

Surprising mix of nurturism and eco doomster stuff, with some laughable scenes of e.g. allegorical sperm. Death = love = death or something - they can’t communicate except by hurting each other. Shogo is unlikeable - initially because of his whining and viciousness, later for other reasons. His character does develop - sideways. his repeatedly murdering the woman who loves him is hard to forget. Both stupid and deep, like the other Tezuka works I’ve seen. 

Elevated by some stunning single panel pages, of Ginza streets packed with graves, of dark floral patterns where they shouldn’t be, of animal communism.

<br>
The aimless adventures of two narcissistic deadbeats. The whole thing is redundant: Almost all of the dialogue is devoted to deadpan description of what’s happening in that panel. This starts off feeling like a kitsch gag, then as the pages drag on it seems to denote mental deficiency, and then you wonder if there’s a meaningful difference between terminal irony and mental illness. Description like this deadens every event, and deadened violence is punk, just as hating yourself is punk, just as hating hating things is.

Nicer than it seems, because it turns irony on itself.

Incoherent, only seeming meaningful. But I read it straight through in one sitting, happily following the ratchet of images, characters, vague paranoid opaque dialogue, some of it very good or at least the dismembered parts of good dialogue.

Clowes now seems mean, misunderstanding, where as a teen I found his uglification of the ordinary deep (“the ordinary is ugly, underneath, man”). Now I see the beauty in certain moderate, conventional, consensus things. Now I see how rare and fragile they are.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6455661)">"The Box Man"</a></h3>

Imiri Sakabashira (2010)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2021<br>
<br>
Nearly wordless (aside from some signage, fake hieroglyphs, some possibly fake Thai, and the epilogue), so it doesn’t make sense to judge it by novelistic standards. Not much plot either, just an image stream: one long chase sequence. These are heavy constraints to work within, harder than say free verse (which gets to silently import nearly all of the sense from whatever language it chooses to wear), and it is amazing how much meaning he manages to convey. Still less than you probably need.

We cross an invisible boundary twice. We move from a Kowloon recursive shanty, chased by cops, to an eldritch snuff brothel, chased by monsters, with hallucinogens along the way muzzing reality. Horrible creatures seem to do terrible things to children, women, a scuba diver, in beautiful surroundings. The orchestrator of the monsters is beaten to death, and rises in death to violate his killer. The box man watches in horror, but can’t stop to help, has to keep moving. Then we're back in the shanty, pursued by monsters and cops and then just cops. Somehow this doesn’t feel cheap like say Maruo or most guro stylists. The Asia Extreme pervertedness is not the point here, and most of the surreal touches are not sexed or violent (florist with a perch-fish face, frog playing the koto), and we run past them to the sea. 

Why be grotesque? And why am I asking that instead of “why be beautiful?” Maybe: Creating beauty is its own justification; making something ugly means you need to compensate us, either in virtuosity (Nabokov’s prose, or Penderecki’s harmonics, or Ito’s linework) or in access to otherwise inaccessible thoughts or feelings. (Novelty is a common justification but I don't think it works alone.) Sakabashira pays both taxes, just about. About a third of the book is impressive double-page single panels, and the visual perspective of these big detailed places is one of the few continuities among the obscure fantasy squibs.

<spoiler>The book has a clear and good allegorical reading: the box man is ferrying his senile dad to an old folk’s home / a hospice. The monsters are the ill-health, dependency, and misanthropy of decay - the chief of the monsters, dementia, devours brains. I dunno what the cheery kappa is, maybe a nurse, or the father’s old self, true self - kappas also need to return to the sea. Why cops? I take both cops and demons to be the other burdens of the son’s life, taxes and death. Compassionate leave doesn’t last long, if you get any. I don’t know why the old folk’s home is depicted as a crazy party - maybe merely not having to work anymore is ecstatic. Or what it means for cops (society, work, obligations) to kill your monsters (negativity, malice, trauma). There’s probably some connection to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9999.The_Box_Man">a surreal novel</a> of the same name but I can’t say. </spoiler>

You can see Box Man as the negation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Good_Life,_If_You_Don%27t_Weaken">Seth</a>, where words take half of every panel, characters meet just to allow more words to come out, all value is held captive in the bubbles. It’s fair to view either extreme (wordlessness or actionlessness) as squandering the dual possibilities of comics, but in fact Seth and Sakabashira are both fine, both fleshing out parts of artistic space that don’t have to appeal to everyone, or anyone, if only they do it well.

Cartoon restaurant reviews for places you’ll never go. It should be boring - more than half the shots are just lo-res black and white drawings of food. But it’s not boring, because the dining is consolation for lovelessness and the sublimation of desires.

<blockquote>listen. There are between four and six hours in the day where I am neither working or sleeping. During all of that time, I think about food. Or, depending on the work, I might spend work hours on food too. Since I’ve given that much of my life to food, don’t you think food owes me a bit of payback?</blockquote>


Yoshinaga depicts herself as a hot mess (with ultrafeminine and antifeminine, childish and elderly forms), but energetic and sincere in using food as alternative to romance. Most media seem to underestimate the sheer power and meaning of our interests (“hobbies” doesn’t serve because it connotes littleness, secondariness). How many people centre on them, instead of on families, jobs, churches?

The Japanese obsession with marriage, as sine qua non of a respectable life, is funny from where I’m standing (how Regency this country is!) but is of course no bloody fun for those trammelled into it. I don’t see it being challenged much. How did the West get over it?

I liked all the foodie detail even though or because I’m no foodie. They do plate sharing, which I like the idea of but can’t imagine getting away with in most British restaurants.

<blockquote>Apologies for the high percentage of entrails. The fact is that Y-naga would die for gizzards, hearts, and liver.</blockquote>


The letterer decided to contract all the names (Yoshinaga -> “Y-naga”), possibly as a legal / privacy thing. For some reason I couldn’t get used to this and got oddly aphasic over it.

Extremely cute, extremely formulaic, contrived (why can’t they get the book from her house?) but the drawing and Art Deco design are incredible. There’s even a system to the sigil spells.

Also it doesn’t fall for the central idiocy of fantasy, which is how anyone is supposed to run a civilisation when anyone can blow it up by accident or design. Shirahama says: because we will lie to people and prevent them from knowing it’s an option.

Also plays with another trope: the follow your dreams, grit is all that matters one. All people are magic users (artists) - but the world would fall apart if they knew it.

<br>
One of the main characters, Teddy, is near-catatonic for half the book. The other dialogue follows his lead, in a way, a mumblecore, time-filling, phatic bathos way. The victims aren’t articulate. The interesting bit is that the twisted Alex Jones mouthpiece is eloquent, stirring, and human sounding.

Almost all of the panels look the same: indoors, with matte walls, small oblong speech bubble up top, single blank potato character in the centre, trying to communicate. Their faces have two moods, like emoticons of old. The poverty is intentional, to evoke monotony to the point of horror.

It helps to know it’s a dystopian work, by which I mean exaggerated. Not that murders don’t happen, not that many office buildings aren’t inexplicably sterile and unfit for sentient life, not that life grinds no one into catatonia, not that you don’t check your email 50 times too often, not that the bottoms of the internet haven’t caused or anyway precipitated sad mayhem already. But the world has fewer horrors now, even with Q and whatever next. if you ignore and select hard enough you can make a lot of things seem hellish, be hellish.

Avoid if sad or worse.

The essence of manga is exaggeration. Men with swords taller than them, preteen superheroes, all kinds of bodies which couldn’t be, all kinds of facial expressions and gesticulations which didn’t exist until they memed themselves into real life. But you can exaggerate anything, it doesn’t have to be combat or sensuality. There’s one about being a better chess player, one about being a better baseball player, one about being a better farmer, one about being a better teacher. All treated with high drama, extreme closeups, and OTT declarations. War against one’s own lack of skill and character. So there is nothing inherently surprising about Barakamon, an exaggerated portrayal of a disgraced calligrapher and his attempt to personalise his art.

Calligraphy is itself an exaggeration, paying excessive attention to a functional thing, writing. I don’t mean that as criticism: most of what’s good in the world comes because someone took something way too seriously.

Naru isn’t as cute as Yotsuba, and Handa isn’t as driven or distinctive as Mashiro. Still nice, still good-looking, still the kind of heightening of the ordinary we need.

Cleverer than it looks. Everyone’s quite chibi, but then in moments of high drama she’ll stretch perspective for effect. 

The class commentary is heavy handed, but then she comes out with a beautiful bit about how some work is noble, that the apparently meaningless never is. I don’t know if the solution it implies (to make boring or difficult work easy, simply deeply understand who needs it done) is scalable enough to be useful, but it is true either way.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24521)">"The Hundred Days (Aubrey & Maturin, #19)"</a></h3>

Patrick O'Brian (1999)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2021<br>
<br>
The cracks finally show here. It’s O’Brian’s own mourning book apparently. Still good, still fantastically subtle alongside its cannonfire (witness Lady Clifford’s reaction to children).

At one point it looks like it’ll be another genre entirely, what with the land crossings, the fearsome order of literal Assassins who must be deprived of their blood money and the triple-crossing of wily pashas.

Great fun with sailor superstitions:

<blockquote> “There is the rope, of course. He can get half a crown an inch for a rope that hanged a right willain. And there are the clothes, bought by them that think a pair of pissed and shitten breeches …’
‘Now then, Killick,’ cried Poll, ‘this ain’t one of your Wapping ale-houses or knocking-kens, so clap a stopper over that kind of talk. “Soiled linen” is what you mean.’
‘… are worth a guinea, for the sake of the luck they bring. But most of all it is the Hand of Glory that makes the hangman so eager for the work. Because why? Because it too is worth its weight in gold … well, in silver.’
‘What’s a Hand of Glory?’ asked the nervous voice.
‘Which it is the hand that did the deed – ripped the young girl up or slit the old gentleman’s throat – and that the hangman cuts off and holds up. And our Doctor has one in a jar which he keeps secret in the cabin and looks at by night with his mate, talking very low.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“Do not take me for a bloody-minded man, Stephen, a death-or-glory swashbuckling cove. Believe me, I had rather see a first-rate burnt to the waterline than a ship’s boy killed or mutilated.”
</blockquote>



<spoiler>The utterly abrupt death of Bonden, and the almost complete lack of public reaction to it, is too moving and outraging. 19 books of him - more depth to this tertiary character than most protagonists - and off he goes. O’Brian’s nihilistic treatment of him is the most artful moment in the book, since it gets a rise out of us while making its point. I won’t forget. All Jack allows himself is that he was “an admirable sailor”, as opposed to a devoted and comic and comically virtuous complete man.</spoiler>

<blockquote> “The doctors are going ashore,’ said Joe Plaice to his old friend Barret Bonden.
‘I don’t blame them,’ said Bonden. ‘I should like to see the sights of Spalato myself. I dare say they are going to burn a candle to some saint.’
‘That’s a genteel way of putting it,’ said Plaice.

At six bells in the middle watch, when all the larboard and most of the starboard guns had been drawn and reloaded with powder that Jack kept for saluting, the doctors came back. They were kindly helped up the side by powerful seamen and they crept, weary and bowed, towards their beds.
‘Wholly shagged out,’ said the gunner’s mate. ‘Dear me, they can’t hardly walk.’
‘Well, we are all of us human,’ said the yeoman of the sheets.” </blockquote>

<br>
Elaborately naive autobiography. Barry is apeing children’s books with her giant all caps lettering and pupilless eyes and primary colours, but she’s surprisingly unsentimental. Unpromising start, with simple loneliness and childhood grotesques, but her teens were pretty extreme, and more than halfway through one of the chapters, “Cicadas”, is very moving. Her punkish positivity and self-criticism carries her through, makes you want to make something crude and idiosyncratic.

Good on puberty, confusion, cognitive dissonance, and fear of love. Not great at broken homes. The gimmick - that Punpun is a silent crude cartoon bird in a world of loud standard manga people - actually works and lasts. It forces Punpun into a passive role, except when he’s daydreaming or talking to comedy afro god, but this fits. Quite a few characters seem criminally insane, 12 years old or no.

<br>
A scary family-dynasty epic told at that point in history where generational gaps grow unbridgeably vast on the spume of telescoping technological progression. First book is a wonderful freewheel through the near-future, with his technolibertarian booster protagonist – <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">Sam Altman</a> meets Richard Stallman meets Ventakesh Rao – running around as midwife to the future. Includes a nepotistic jaunt through Edinburgh because why not (it's a tech town after all). It is funny and prescient about our dependence on feeds and open-source expansion.

<blockquote>Welcome to the early twenty-first century, human.
It’s night in Milton Keynes, sunrise in Hong Kong. Moore’s Law rolls inexorably on, dragging humanity toward the uncertain future. The planets of the solar system have a combined mass of approximately 2 x 10<sup>27</sup> kilograms. Around the world, laboring women produce forty-five thousand babies a day, representing 10<sup>23</sup> MIPS of processing power. Also around the world, fab lines casually churn out thirty million microprocessors a day, representing 10<sup>23</sup> MIPS. In another ten months, most of the MIPS being added to the solar system will be machine-hosted for the first time.</blockquote>



The confusing part is that the first third of it is among my favourite books and I recommend it often. But the later books work less well; they become less and less convincing as we reach the singularity (his grasp of the physics and the economics of computers and space is characteristically excellent, and it's all hard enough) - more and more of that omniscient voiceover guy is needed.

<blockquote>Not everyone is concerned with the deep future. But it’s important! If we live or die, that doesn’t matter—that’s not the big picture. The big question is whether information originating in our light cone is preserved, or whether we’re stuck in a lossy medium where our very existence counts for nothing. It’s downright embarrassing to be a member of a species with such a profound lack of curiosity about its own future, especially when it affects us all personally!
</blockquote>


I agree with Kahneman, though, that it's wrong to put as much weight on a weak ending as people tend to; the experiencing self, who was deeply impressed most of the time, should not be relegated so.

<blockquote>In the distance, the cat hears the sound of lobster minds singing in the void, a distant feed streaming from their cometary home as it drifts silently out through the asteroid belt, en route to a chilly encounter beyond Neptune. The lobsters sing of alienation and obsolescence, of intelligence too slow and tenuous to support the vicious pace of change that has sandblasted the human world until all the edges people cling to are jagged and brittle.

Minority Report plus occupational prediction plus extreme quantified self. As usual, it’s about the line between predicting and causing, cameras and engines. Also the set-a-thief-to-catch-a-thief unavoidable corruption of police work.

Your phone gives you a score at all times. It’s not subjective wellbeing, since it can be clear even when you feel terrible. It’s how dangerous you are to society, or anyway to the predictor.

The first chapter immediately pokes holes in the system - the kidnapping victim driven to arson suicide by fear of the system’s self-fulfilling judgments.

Very satire-worthy weapons (guns with onboard psychiatric evaluation, which won’t fire at anyone except those it ranks as criminal or potentially criminal). They show one and only one nice thing about this future (programmable matter walls, so you can have breakfast in a different historical room every day) before getting into the greasy monotonous dystopian bs that you came for.

Philip K Dick’s 1956 achievement with predicting/hallucinating an algorithmic society is becoming only more impressive.

Beautiful art, but the story is vague, sentimental, filled with a smug supernaturalism, the supernaturalism of coincidences, ineffability, and the rule of attraction rather than fireballs and gods.

Succeeds at a common failure: to make nothing happening interesting, to show that nothing never happens. Also nails the fauve-doodle-lofi-brut style. The protagonist’s daydreams are real streams of consciousness, giant A2 spreads of quite violent strobing thoughts. He gets carried away - the explanation he is giving someone stops being a speech bubble and becomes the entire page, 6 entire pages of self-reference and self-answering. Then there’s his infodump on his neighbours, friendly physics diagrams and gentle overwhelming debunking which also leads him into himself. Likeable and avant-garde, and how often does that happen?

Sometimes smooshing two* cliches together (time loop + cute boys n girls in mechs) produces something uncliched. Keiji’s deaths are often funny, not sure why. The use of videogame logic for emotional effect reminds me of Mogworld

“What if someone who had the potential to discover a formula to unlock the mysteries of the universe wanted to become a pulp fiction writer? What if someone who had the potential to create unparalleled gastronomic delicacies had his heart set on civil engineering? There is what we desire to do, and what we are able to do...”

It doesn’t show the spiritual death of repetition / mastery that Groundhog Day excels in. He gets headaches and mourns lost comrades, but that’s different.

<spoiler>The mimics rewind time whenever something goes badly for them, e.g. Rita kills them all. But then why do they rewind on the times that she dies? Keiji’s death rewinds make sense, since those are when Rita does too well. Maybe it’s a global thing.

<br>
How did the Roman empire last so long with leaders like this?

Seneca is complex, if by complex you mean "among the most contradictory people in history". He was a vocal ascetic and one of the richest men in the world. He was a beautiful exponent of liberty and prudence, and a shill for an insane rapist for a decade - but it would have worse to abandon Rome to Nero and his rapey mates. Thrasea Paetus is the respective true stoic, the noble abstainer.


Classic historian move: when dealing with possibilities that don't appeal to him, Romm just hems and haws and says that they're implausible; I'm not even mad. He also reports very dubious "evidence" via Dio and Tacitus, like the content of private conversations between Agrippina and Nero with no one else present. 

Sense of doom on Seneca's family throughout, including his blameless nephew.  Why didn't they run? They were so rich, and the government was so much smaller and poorly-informed.

Breezy but also contrived somehow. So like Bill Bryson: always on the lookout for an obscure fact and a dad joke. 

The premise is completely sublime: the collision of the natural and artificial, the amoral and moral, the obligate and voluntary. The tragicomedy of human dominion, at this tech level. A couple of the anecdotes pay off:

<blockquote>The case is detailed in an unusual 1906 book, The Criminal Prosecution and Capital Punishment of Animals. When I first paged through it, I wondered if it might be an ambitious hoax. Here were bears formally excommunicated from the Church. Slugs given three warnings to stop nettling farmers, under penalty of “smiting”…

We have writs of ejectment issued to rats and thrust into their burrows. From a 1545 complaint brought by vintners against a species of greenish weevil, we have not only the names of the lawyers but early examples of that time-honored legal tactic, the stall. As far as I could tell, the proceedings dragged on eight or nine months—in any case, longer than the life span of a weevil.

… an epidemic of car break-ins at Yosemite campgrounds. Between 2001 and 2007, eleven hundred automobiles were broken into by bears… It turned out that fewer than five bears—sows and their cubs—were behind the break-ins. This is typical. From the start of the year to the September of my visit, bears in Snowmass have broken into houses through unlocked doors or windows sixty times. Wildlife-camera images have implicated just four bears. A bear research scientist with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Dave Garshelis, told me about a call he got from a National Guard camp where bears were raiding pallets of military rations called MREs, which bears apparently enjoy more than soldiers do. He was told that around a hundred bears were raiding the supplies. “The guy said, ‘I’ll bring you to this place where you look across to this ridge that is completely pockmarked with bear dens.’ I was like, ‘This sounds cool.’ ” The “dens” turned out to be natural landscape features, and “a hundred bears” in fact was three.

These elephants were not in the intention to kill,” Officer Raj says. How does he know? Because the bodies were in one piece. “If an elephant is in an angry mode, the body will not be intact. It will get in pieces.” A book by Jayantha Jayewardene includes a list of the nine recorded methods by which an angry or musth-addled elephant has killed a human being. “Placing a fore foot on one limb of the victim and ripping off the other with the trunk” is number 3. (Elephants use a similar anchor-and-pull technique to strip an uprooted shrub of limbs and leaves to eat.) Rulers of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in the 1600s were said to have taken advantage of this natural behavior, training elephants to serve as executioners.

“The past decade has seen a minor epidemic of people plummeting from balconies because of monkeys. I found news accounts of six deaths in the last three years alone. Most famously, there was the 2007 fall of Delhi deputy mayor S. S. Bajwa. While taking the air, Bajwa was startled by a group of macaques set on storming the house to look for food. As he tried to stop them—or get away from them (there were no eyewitnesses)—he lost his footing and hurtled over the railing”

Crow-bombing, in fact, was a government-sponsored conservation effort. Who oversaw the bombing deaths of 250,000 Illinois crows during the winter of 1935? The Illinois conservation commissioner.

Because the birds were many, the cost of ammunition high, and the admiral budget-minded, the initial assault was done without guns. It took place in 1941 and is detailed in a Fish and Wildlife Service Special Scientific Report, under the heading “Large Scale Elimination Experiment.” Two hundred men carrying lengths of pipe or wooden clubs “spent 6 or 7 hours a day” hitting albatrosses on the back of the head. An estimated eighty thousand birds were killed... “The birds,” Hubert wrote in his memoir, “mostly sat quietly in place until clubbed.” Mable’s tapes captured only “the crack of ash on skulls” and, at one point, the distress cry of a young sailor: “I didn’t join the Navy to crush the heads of innocent birds.”

Still, neither Julie nor Sarah would say that gulls, as a species, are dickish.

Shaun makes his living from tourism but is by avocation closer to a naturalist. I don’t know the precise parameters of that calling, but I think that if you find yourself applying the word impressive to any variety of animal one.
</blockquote>



But too much of the rest is dull travelogue and forced dovetails. Rather than track the sublime nonsense of concrete nature meeting abstract legality, she spends almost all of it hanging with scientists and forest officials, learning some words and spotting some danger. There is little law in it, nor in the topic: instead, ecology and popular opinion determine the creatures’ fate. Here’s the kind of ingenious foolishness I had hoped for a book of, the gerrymandering of morals in the face of an unreformable enemy you don’t have the heart to eradicate:

<blockquote>India’s top agricultural pests also happen to be sacred animals. Elephants represent the deity Ganesh, and monkeys, Hanuman. The wild boar is an avatar of Vishnu. The nilgai, or blue bull, is actually an antelope, but gai means cow, and cows are sacred. When state officials wanted to begin culling the animal, they first pushed through a name change. Nilgais are now roj, or “forest antelope.”
</blockquote>



Some pretty irresponsible discussion about ricin.

Was surprised when she said she had grandkids; her energetic, relentlessly informal, lulz driven escapades make her sound half her age.

<blockquote>In a lush tropical environment, a bait has to be extremely tempting† to compete with the natural food sources. Aaron hands me a bottle of Goodnature bait, a chocolatey-coconutty goo that smells, but does not taste, delicious. It’s like eating suntan lotion, I tell Aaron.
“You tried it?” His look combines horror, confusion, and pity. “You want some gum?”
</blockquote>



This seems wrong, from my long experience:

<blockquote>people like me want to have their hamburgers. Only once or twice a year, I want to say. But I know that’s a lame defense. It’s not the quantity that matters, it’s the statement you make or don’t make. When you tell people you don’t eat beef—or would never use a glue trap—you make the alternative a little less comfortable for them.
</blockquote>


Maybe if you’re the first vegetarian anyone’s ever met, and if you’re notably charming and undogmatic. But that’s an increasingly rare service.


Why am I disappointed at this being a perfectly good pop science book? Because the pop law book scarcely exists. It still has a dozen things worth quoting, that you can’t find in any other secondary text, and that’s rare enough for 3 stars.

Didactic, but I’m not sure I could do any better, manage to have less exposition, while writing for a general audience. I liked the details, like asteroid minerals crashing the market, or monopolism as a response to price gouging, or how structurally dangerous it’d be for Supes to lift a plane, and the infinite energy crank actually being a relatively low yield project with extremely high plant costs.

<blockquote> People made jokes about Superman endlessly turning a crank at a constant speed in a basement somewhere. The problem was that the real issues in the world of energy were ones of transmission and distribution. MoSI had spent tens of thousands of manhours on what was internally dubbed “The Crank Problem”, trying to make sense of the math and engineering, some of which wasn’t just engineering, but theoretical engineering, and some of the theoretical engineering was meta-theoretical engineering, where the engineers were trying to figure out what kind of costs would be involved in doing enough research that there would be a practical underpinning necessary to try doing something that worked in theory but had never actually been tried.</blockquote>

Xinran (2003)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2014<br>
<br>
Horrible and yet somehow ripping portrait of patriarchal suffering. It's undermined by the editing; the narrative is too neat (at one point she happens to bump into the family of the homeless woman that called her saying how much she missed them). Maybe she just had a very cinematic few years, as one of the most famous women in the country, but the many coincidences and stranger-than-fiction dovetails make it difficult to take it too seriously. I don’t actually doubt that the interviews happened, nor that she received the aggregate worry and misery for thousands. It's just that she portrays as a little village where Xinran was wise mother, with all distant rumours bursting into her life. 

Maybe my reaction is a cheap defence against e.g. the thought of an 11 year old repeatedly giving themselves pneumonia to avoid their rapist father and other tales of ordinary madness.

<br>
Nice uncliched action framing; often 18 or more tiny panels per page, including stop motion of bullets. And the animals are emotive and individual with a vocabulary of about 10 words.

The implied theory of evil is kind of odd. There's an idealist mad scientist, and it's partly his fault. There's a soft-hearted linguist, partly hers. And then there's a shadowy senator whose betrayal kicks everything off. He's the butt of the piece. I wouldn't be surprised if Morrison had a "Boo politicians" view, but this isn't a strong example.

<br>
Lovely. Pratchett animates and romanticises a view he doesn’t hold - traditionalism, ascribed identity, professionalism, moaning old men losing their grip on the new. He reuses the joke - the symbiosis of enemies, the unemotional violence of the professional assassin and target, hero and troll, hero and villain - half a dozen times in the series. 

Amazingly, this squib has an expensive fan adaptation: https://www.trollbridge.film/

<br>
<blockquote> Letice had a black velvet cloak so fine that if looked as if a hole had been cut out of the world. Nanny did not. Nanny did not want a fine velvet cloak and did not aspire to such things. So she didn't see why other people should have them.

It was the same in just about every trade. Sooner or later someone decided it needed organizing, and the one thing you could be sure of was that the organizers weren't going to be the people who, by general acknowledgement, were at the top of their craft. They were working too hard. To be fair, it generally wasn't done by the worst, neither. They were working hard, too. They had to.
No, it was done by the ones who had just enough time and inclination to scurry and bustle. And, to be fair again, the world needed people who scurried and bustled. You just didn't have to like them very much. 
</blockquote>



Pratchett’s fantasy is unusual in two ways: it has humans in it, and it has social development in it. Most have only the tails of us: the worst and the best, the peak and trough experiences which don’t actually cover very much of life.

Philosophical question about his transfiguration: they make a robot look like him, and it thinks it is him, has his memories and his hangdog attitude. But when it finds out it is not flesh anymore, it decides it is not him. This makes no sense, and is never questioned. I think it’s mainstream though.

Two-thirds idiotic or sleazy puns, a three-tenths jokes I just don’t understand fifty years on, and a residue of pure genius, wordless and timeless. Obviously not PC, but in a very innocent way which it would take devotion to the bit to feel attacked by. The Turk sequence is moving, sordid, confusing, great, a different artist.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52741293)">"Shuggie Bain"</a></h3>

Douglas   Stuart (2020)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2022<br>
<br>
A good misery memoir but no more. It is sodden with desperation and with rape. There's a lot of those in the world. But there's more of other things.

It’s apparently pretty autobiographical. if Stuart’s lived experience is such and such, who am I to contradict it? Well it's not his experience I take issue with, it's the depiction of the whole city as a depraved concrete jungle. This is about the only place I get to pull an identity card: I’ve lived in the rougher part of the roughest place in Scotland (Paisley). Jakeys shooting up in the hall, rats, rain, far-right billboards. But a book would be basically false if it included only these and not hundreds of hours in a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gordonjc/4508756449">beautiful</a> free library, helpless laughter with your idiot mate, delight in basic things and discounts. Ferguslie 2013 wasn’t as rough as Sighthill 1981, and 14 isn’t 23, but it’s not a million miles.

<blockquote>“The men standing around her were only boys, younger than her and probably younger than Leek. They had been smoking and waiting in the dark. With no peace at home they were waiting for someone to molest or for a chance to knife the night watchman”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Rain was the natural state of Glasgow. It kept the grass green and the people pale and bronchial. Its effect on the taxi business was negligible. It was a problem because it was mostly inescapable and the constant dampness was pervasive, so fares might as well sit damp on a bus as damp in the back of an expensive taxi. On the other hand, rain meant that the young lassies from the dancing all wanted to take a taxi home so as not to ruin their stiff hair or their sharp shoes”</blockquote>



Anyway it is silly of me to be cross at fiction for not being nonfiction, except that fiction informs you people, and misery memoirs mostly inform you wrong. Here's a line where Stuart admits it:

<blockquote>The city was alive below him, and he had never seen a half of it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now and then fresh air pulled in and out of the sixteenth-floor window, and the women blinked at the sharpness of it. Lizzie drank her cold black tea and watched as the women all descended towards the darkness in their moods. Fresh air always did this to the drunk. The light, gossipy energy was leaving the room and being replaced by something stickier and thicker</blockquote>



The logic is fully established by the end of chapter 6 and I would stop there if I had known this. Actually that 80 page novella is a better book I think. Agnes' only real mistake is to seek passion and excitement in place of dour duty. Her punishment for this is extreme but not unrealistic, given the amplifiers around her, booze and poverty.

<blockquote>“the way it tasted like fizzy ginger, milk, and porridge all at the same time”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“You cheeky streak of piss.” Her false teeth ground together in her tight face. Only her eyes were loose and half-detached, rolling under the waves of the day’s drink.”</blockquote>


Glasgow had problems on top of the normal Scottish ones:

<blockquote>“Aw, ye missed a great game, a bloody great game.” The man was tutting to himself. “Who do ye support then?”
“Celtic,” he lied. He was no Catholic, but it was the shortcut to ending the conversation.
The auld man’s face crumpled like a dropped towel. “Oh, fur fuck’s sake, might’ve known ah’d get in a Pape’s taxi.”</blockquote>


I never heard any of this shite in my whole childhood, except from visiting Glaswegians.

Is there a single male character in this who isn’t predatory, apart from Shug? Yes: Mr Cameron, Catherine’s middle-class boss. (The book is oddly fair to Big Shug, not just a 2D swaggering abuser, whose monologue chapter comes straight after the shocking violence of Blackpool, but which is poetic and only normally predatory.)

<blockquote>“Ah. I’ll let you touch my willy.”
The driver looked at the boy in the mirror for a while. His eyes sat deep and small in his pink face. They were hard to read. His lips barely moved beneath his moustache. “Son, how old are you?”
“Fourteen.”
The man didn’t take his eyes from the boy’s face. His head seemed to roll back on to his thick neck, and his moustache danced unhappily”</blockquote>



Agnes' father is ultimately revealed as a fool who gives in and reinforces predation. Leek looks predatory and makes camp with predators but isn't. Half of the women too.

I wonder how many fourteen year olds there are now, parenting their parents? Luckily fewer than then.

<blockquote>Shuggie nodded, slowly and obediently. He had touched it [their mother] last. He could never be free. </blockquote>

<blockquote>“would have sat back at her side and wrapped his arms around her legs. He could starve, as long as they starved together”</blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7967)">"Speaker for the Dead (Ender's Saga, #2)"</a></h3>

Orson Scott Card (1994)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2022<br>
<br>
Card is obsessed with family; <spoiler>the happy ever after involves giving a mother of six another six children</spoiler>.

<blockquote>It was Plikt, the good Lutheran, who taught Valentine to conceive of Ender’s life in religious terms; the powerful stability of her family life and the miracle of each of her five children combined to instill in her the emotions, if not the doctrines, of faith.</blockquote>



Parochial Catholic norms somehow persist in a galactic empire. He has a slightly bizarre faith in the power of books to move entire populations. His names for things are often childish (buggers and piggies). He continues to make his young characters absurdly precocious (consider the 12yo Olhado, leet hacker).

But no matter: he is a master storyteller. He manages to use one village and one forest as if they were giant panoramas. If you found Ender's Game didactic, unrealistic, contrived - well, you're right, but give him another chance.

He's also slightly alien to me, which makes him good at scifi. Underneath Card's extreme Great Man Theory (where 3 people determine half of human history) there's a pretty realist account of how social forces work.

<blockquote>Some sort of rigid hierarchy always emerged as the conservative force in a community, maintaining its identity despite the constant variations and changes that beset it. If there were no powerful advocate of orthodoxy, the community would inevitably disintegrate. A powerful orthodoxy is annoying, but essential to the community... She compared the priestly class to the skeleton of vertebrates.</blockquote>


This means that he has to eventually drop his mockery of the narrow and pompous bishop, who is exactly this skeletal force: dumb, reactionary, regularising. Card really likes communitarian shit: constraints, norms, rituals, and roles.

<blockquote>And yet she felt strangely healed, as if simply saying her mistake were enough to purge some of the pain of it. For the first time, then, she caught a glimpse of what the power of speaking might be. It wasn’t a matter of confession, penance, and absolution, like the priests offered. It was something else entirely. Telling the story of who she was, and then realizing that she was no longer the same person.</blockquote>



I wonder about the Descolada, the horrifying mutagenic disease that perfuses the planet. Ender accepts it without hesitation, even knowing that he'll never be able to leave. This echoes Card's fetish for family: "constraints are good". 
<spoiler>The entire plot turns on one insane decision of Novinha. "she would have no other death on her conscience". The desire for clean hands as sick iron law, more important than the desire for a good world. Ender's guilt is much the same. Card views the sickness as honourable, but also a sin, "the pride of universal guilt".</spoiler>

<spoiler>Everyone is very blasé about letting Miro leave town while infected with a universal ecocidal disease. Yes, he ends up not contacting any ecosystems, but this is a late development.</spoiler>

Weike Wang (2017)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2023<br>
<br>
A book just about your parents raising you Wrong would default to cliche; a book about failing grad school would default to banal (You get too wrapped up in your own work. You start to take lab personally... over time, you find yourself no longer mesmerized); a book about trying your best to drive away your cheerful and caring boyfriend could be sordid. But put em all together with tight prose and it passes.

<blockquote>
The chemistry that I do involves putting many LEGOs together and having another LEGO come out. The LEGOs are molecules, but unlike real LEGOs, I cannot see them or touch them.

There is a professor in my department who is no longer allowed to have graduate students. Under his tutelage, too many have committed suicide

		...another big fight. Though big is also quiet, because when mad, Eric says nothing. He sits and stares off into space. When really mad, he stands up and goes to another room. I find that I am most like her in this way. I will follow him into that other room to say the same things I had said in the room before. Hello, are you listening? Hello, are you deaf? But that anti-temper of his is unassailable

Aluminum used to be more expensive than gold. Napoleon had an aluminum cutlery set that he used only for visiting royalty. The gold set he used every day.</blockquote>


(The trouble with science in novels is that - even if the novelist gets it, as Wang does - the reader’s ignorance still constrains the writer to saccharine shallow lines about it,  “Pure crystals are those that have perfectly repeating units. You told me this after I asked you what you found beautiful about chemistry. But what of the repeating units in life?”. But at least some of her metaphors are good.)

Self-sabotage as self-expression. I can’t read too much of that: I get impatient with characters who make their lives worse on purpose.

<blockquote>That phrase about sticks and stones and bones. But my bones are very brittle. And I am lactose intolerant.</blockquote>




Not much progression in the first 150 pages, just constant wallowing and flashbacks to her awful parents. But she eventually starts to unfreeze.

I think Wang’s big success is capturing a certain familiar STEM personality which I haven’t seen in art before: smart but graceless, literal and spiritually flat, resentfully hypercompetitive for want of any better purpose. Unphilosophical; innocent. Unorthodox, distant approach to their own feelings.

<blockquote>The lab mate is a good person but sometimes I think, had I never met her, I would have asked less often, Why would a field need me when it has someone like her? A proverb my father made up: To progress in life, you must always compare yourself with someone better and never with someone worse

Please stop, just for a little while, and let me catch up. How do you expect me to marry you if you never let me catch up

I have requested of the shrink: Find me the thing that I can make the greatest impact in and I will do that thing. You and everybody else, she replied.</blockquote>



Worst-case tiger parenting (many such cases):

<blockquote>Eric introduced me to music. Before him, I was listening to silence. And yet I played piano for ten years...

I can’t stand it when they are mad at me. I can’t sleep, and once I can’t sleep, I can’t do much of anything else... The power they have over you, Eric says. I just don’t get it
</blockquote>

 Same.

Also rare in fiction: The Untraumatised Nice Modest Smart Caring Fella:

<blockquote>At one point, he is in five bands, along with marching band at school. He is told that playing the drums will get him chicks. Actually the friend says it will get him laid. Not once does that happen. He does not get laid until college and not because of drums. The girl just finds him cute...

I list some girls with whom he might be happier</blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15731248)">"The Ph.D. Grind: A Ph.D. Student Memoir"</a></h3>

Philip J. Guo (2015)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Feb 2020<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Question: Is your book meant as a critique of academia or a call for reform?
Absolutely not. I don't have any agenda besides telling my own story as honestly as possible.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>most Ph.D. students are directly training for a job that they will never get. (Imagine how disconcerting it would be if medical or law school graduates couldn’t get jobs as doctors or lawyers, respectively.)</blockquote>


Strange one. It's 100 pages of minor mental breakdowns, ten thousand hours of mind-numbing gruntwork, stupid status games, and disillusionment - all in plain, businesslike, affectless prose. Also, there's very little technical detail in it. You'd think he was describing painting a house, rather than a painful initiation into the partially-insane system of placing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">logic incarnate</a> in harness (a system with surprisingly weak links to discovery and progress).

<blockquote>research was my only job, and I wouldn’t be able to earn a degree unless I succeeded at it. My mood was inextricably tied to how well I was progressing every day, and during those months, progress was painfully slow.
</blockquote>


He spends two years of his life on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">nasty little problems</a>, thousands of hours of config and debugging, nothing to show for it, no papers, no new results. The top CS schools don't let you graduate until you get 4 papers in "top" conferences: layers upon layers of luck and gatekeeping, only modestly correlated with your efforts. Oh, and you are unlikely to have much choice of project either. A recipe for misery. This is at the very top of the game, too: Stanford with full funding and annual internships at the big lads. It is both reassuring and horrifying to hear that elite groups waste months and submit total shit sometimes.
<blockquote>In the end, it took three attempts by four Ph.D. students over the course of five years before Dawson’s initial Klee-UC idea turned into a published paper. Of those four students, only one “survived”—I quit the Klee project, and two others quit the Ph.D. program altogether.</blockquote>


Guo is no Jeremiah: despite his suffering, despite his very penetrating analysis of the waste and the idiocies, he doesn't declaim the system. He just analyses the narrow, nonscientific incentives of those around him and gets on with winning the game. He talks like this: "i think that leveraging [software] and aligning with both of your interests and incentives will be the best way for me to both make a contribution and also to feel satisfied about making concrete forward progress every day.”. He uses 'top-tier' without scare quotes. At one point he dispassionately notes that half a dozen of his papers were rejected because he wasn't fluent in the specific sub-field's “rhetorical tricks, newfangled buzzwords, and marketing-related contortions required to satisfy reviewers". That is, he comes up against bullshit Bourdieuan micro-distinctions, boundary work, irrelevant to science, and shrugs and sets about learning how to pass as an insider. Look elsewhere <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/15/can-twitter-save-science/">for the</a> <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/grad">relevant</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2010/12/16/the-disposable-academic">denunciations</a>. 

It would be cynical to think that he doesn't milk the politics of postgraduate pain because he landed well, is a professor now - instead just envy him his inner calm:

<blockquote>my six years of Ph.D. training have made me wiser, savvier, grittier, and more steely, focused, creative, eloquent, perceptive, and professionally effective than I was as a fresh college graduate. (Two obvious caveats: Not every Ph.D. student received these benefits—many grew jaded and burned-out from their struggles. Also, lots of people cultivate these positive traits without going through a Ph.D. program.)... 
Pursuing a Ph.D. has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life, and I feel extremely lucky to have been given the opportunity to be creative during this time.
</blockquote>


There is this to be said for the American seven year ditch: Guo was able to suffer and wander for three entire years before he had his first big idea. That's the other side: the incredible privilege of being paid to read, paid to talk to clever people, paid to think new thoughts. But who says privileges have to feel nice, or not drive you half-mad?

A very valuable warning for some tiny fraction of the world, a flat curio for some other tiny voyeur fraction.

Dan Abnett (2008)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2020<br>
<br>
Top shelf mind candy. There are several sides to 40k: the original indie English lulz, the corporate grimdark edginess which misses the irony, and then what the few real writers make of it. (Ian Watson and Abnett are two I know about.)

The first 150 pages here have no giant robots, only the quiet apprehensive horror of a war economy, war emotions. Lovers parted by conscription, blocks of lives traded for nothing, the belligerent joy of a public which hasn't lost its first battle yet. Then you get plenty of omnipotent bots, a conspiracy, and two parties in desperate retreat.

I like the Mechanicus because, unlike the rest of their society they are half-rational, occasionally have to confront the pervasive superstition and noble lies.

Several times you get a unique twist on PTSD, from old men who spent decades inhabiting a war machine:

<blockquote>Zink hobbled over to his hut at the best full stride his old legs could manage. He took out the worn step ladder that he used for pruning the boughs of the ploin trees, and carried it back to the west wall. This execution took the best part of half an hour, and Zink had to stop and catch his breath twice. More than twice, he forgot what he was about and began to carry the ladder back to the hut. When he reached the wall, he came about, two points, low stride, west rotation, and dragged the ladder into the wet flowerbeds.</blockquote>



I struggle a bit with the psychology of the wicked Satanic enemy. Even in thoughtful authors like Abnett their motivations and strategies are too predictably vicious, too unsustainable - they've invaded this planet, fine, but then they blow up half the cities in it. So what's the point of invading?

<blockquote>The archenemy, in his long experience, often ignored 
tactical logic or strategic merit, but this was an odd choice even by the archenemy’s perverse standards.</blockquote>



An enemy who was so haphazard, divided, unstrategic would struggle to threaten a whole organised empire. They could just be terrorists, or value suffering itself, or just be damaging infrastructure for the wider conflict. But this is a flat worldview, one you can't do anything with except backdrop the nobility of your own characters. Which is one reason there's not a lot of literature in this canon. Abnett compensates well as usual, with flawed and distinctive protagonists, rigorous fantasy logistics and tactics, nice setpieces, plenty of humanising nonmilitary detail, and good satisfying betrayals.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145)">"Steve Jobs"</a></h3>

Walter Isaacson (2011)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2018<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson#Bibliography">Spot the odd one out</a>: Franklin, Einstein, da Vinci, Kissinger, Jobs. (Trick question! there's two odds out: the first three had huge positive effects on science and society; while Jobs' and Kissinger's impact on the world is respectively "eh?" and "catastrophic".)

I don't really understand what people see in Jobs, "the most beloved billionaire". He was a turd to just about everyone he met from the age of about 12.

<blockquote>in the middle of seventh grade he gave his parents an ultimatum. 'I insisted they put me in a different school'. Financially this was a tough demand; his parent were barely making ends meet, but by this point there was little doubt that they would eventually bend to his will. 'When they resisted, I told them I would just quit going to school if I had to go back...'</blockquote>


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Some</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson">of those</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive">people</a> happened to be brilliant, and responded fairly well to being treated like dirt. How much credit does this omnidickery deserve? (I've been told I'm missing the value of management skills, gumption, motivational speaking. OK, then be clear it was this and not innovation, not engineering, not design. Kottke: "Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person.". <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612071502/http://www.woz.org/letters/general/91.html">Also the thief.</a>) 

In the absence of Jobs, it's hard to see it taking much longer than a couple of years for someone to introduce nice personal computers, computer fonts, portable MP3, heartfelt CGI, or omnisurveillance bricks. And maybe those others wouldn't charge through the nose. Catch the ring of pure mania here:

<blockquote>'If I had never dropped in on that single [calligraphy] course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. 
</blockquote>


I suppose the evidence in favour of him being talented (and not just being lucky and dominating some talented people) is the string of successes (Apple, NeXT, Pixar, Apple). Not a huge sample size, but big in context.

I now have lots of questions, none of which Isaacson raises or settles. (In this regard it's much shallower than either his Einstein or Kissinger books.):

* Could we have gotten the expensive gizmos without all the abuse?

* What <b>was</b> the net effect of his life? 
Millions of pretty objects 
minus abandoning a child 
minus hundreds of petty sneers and little brutalities
minus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides">30 suicides</a> ... 
I don't see how to do this. People like Design, sure, but how much?

* His personal philosophy seems straightforwardly terrible, all the worst of kneejerk Sixties exoticism. Intuition over reason ("more powerful than intellect"), AND will over sympathy, AND <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924574/">nature over science</a>, AND post-truth ("[Jobs'] reality distortion field was a confounding melange of charismatic rhetoric, indomitable will, and eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand.") What's the point of being a 'spiritual being' if you're still a dick afterward?

* Macs are highly underpowered for their price. In theory, this represents a grave loss of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus">consumer surplus</a>; that is, it loses the point of an economy. But I can't just say that, because people queue up for this stuff. Either they're all exquisite aesthetes who gain surplus by looking at their device during those long extra minutes it takes to finish processing, or the social cachet compensates. I don't have a clear idea of how to judge surplus when computers are not about computing.

* Your view of Gates vs Jobs is very telling. One is uncool and compromising, but has saved <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/bill-gates-philanthropy-warren-buffett-vaccines-infant-mortality">many millions of lives</a>; the other is cool and uncompromising, but, after reading Isaacson, it would not surprise me to hear that none of Jobs' $3.3bn went on philanthropy (it might have been anonymous).

* Do we need reality distorters? Must we be led into greatness by visionary liars and rogues? (Musk has a bit of this too.)

<blockquote>"If you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him 'Pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are."</blockquote>

 Sure is no way that attitude could ever do any harm. I suppose I should just be grateful he stayed out of politics.

Wasn't sure what to rate the book, since it is mostly clear about a dubious subject. Isaacson often stumbles into the Distortion Field

<blockquote>"'I think I might have headed to New York if I didn't go to college', [Jobs] recalled, musing on how different his world - and perhaps all of ours - might have been..."

Extremely mixed. First chapter is great, a nice high-level summary of the difficult history of getting computers to understand us, and the many fields and field factions involved. (Linguistics is a deep science that in large part taught CS how to do theory, but certain of its dogmas - against probabilities, against machine learning - ended up holding it back for decades.)

But chapters 2-5 are bad: weird notation, and almost no diagrams for lots of natively geometric ideas. That said, fig 3.3. is a great essence of backprop. I switched to Jurafsky afterward.

Blogposts from a thoughtful doomer. Name a hot button, anything, and he will elevate it to the scariest thing in the world: internet surveillance, zoonotic viruses, climate change, Trump, the security detail around the G8. Bloody-minded sympathy, Left nihilism, boundless sensawunda, viscera instead of prose - and but deep unreliability when he gets on a subject besides marine biology. He is vulnerable to anything cool or fucked up. I like him a lot, but I'm worried if I find myself agreeing with him, since he so often misleads himself.

<blockquote>If I am indeed fated to sink into this pit of surveillance capitalism with the rest of you, I’d just as soon limit my fantasies about eating the rich to a venue that doesn’t shut you down the moment some community-standards algo thinks it sees an exposed nipple in a jpeg.</blockquote>


Everything he does is excessive. Of course, this makes for good aesthetics and bad epistemics.

Like <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/">Charlie Stross</a>, Watts reads horrifying things into the news, informed by the toxic half of history but also by a nebulous paranoia which leads them astray. (Representative sample from Stross: "[media incentive] has been weaponized, in conjunction with data mining of the piles of personal information social networks try to get us to disclose (in the pursuit of advertising bucks), to deliver toxic propaganda straight into the eyeballs of the most vulnerable — with consequences that are threaten to undermine the legitimacy of democratic governmance on a global scale.". Watts:

<blockquote>Bureaucratic and political organisms are like any other kind; they exist primarily to perpetuate themselves at the expense of other systems. You cannot convince such an organism to act against its own short-term interests... It’s not really news, but we seem to be living in a soft dictatorship. The only choices we’re allowed to make are those which make no real difference... On a purely selfish level I’m happier than I’ve ever been in my life, happier than I deserve. Of course it won’t last. I do not expect to die peacefully, and I do not expect to die in any jurisdiction with a stable infrastructure. At least I don’t have to worry about the world I’m leaving behind for my children; I got sterilized in 1991.</blockquote>

) 

The two biggest fumbles here are his posts on <a href="https://replicationindex.com/2018/01/05/bem-retraction/">Daryl Bem</a> and high-functioning <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Hydrocephalus">hydrocephalic</a> people. It is no shame to fall for either: these are highly respectable academic hoaxes, and Bem's methods were <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-statistical-crisis-in-science">exactly as valid</a> as the average psychology paper of the early C21st. Watts' mistake isn't to insist that ESP is real, but to leap to the defence of the weird just because it is weird, to the point where he rejects Hume's maxim ("<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00117/full">Laplace's principle</a>"), a basic incontrovertible theorem of <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Extraordinary_claims_require_extraordinary_evidence#Probability_theory">Bayesian inference</a>.

<blockquote>these results, whatever you thought of them, were at least as solid as those used to justify the release of new drugs to the consumer market. I liked that. It set things in perspective, although in hindsight, it probably said more about the abysmal state of Pharma regulation... I’m perfectly copacetic with the premise that psychology is broken. But if the field is really in such disrepair, why is it that none of those myriad less-rigorous papers acted as a wake-up call? Why snooze through so many decades of hack analysis only to pick on a paper which, by your own admission, is better than most?<br>

The question, here in the second decade of the 21st Century, is: what constitutes an “extraordinary claim”? A hundred years ago it would have been extraordinary to claim that a cat could be simultaneously dead and alive; fifty years ago it would have been extraordinary to claim that life existed above the boiling point of water, kilometers deep in the earth’s crust. Twenty years ago it was extraordinary to suggest that the universe was not only expanding but that the rate of expansion was accelerating. Today, physics concedes the theoretical possibility of time travel</blockquote>



Another big miss is his emphasis on adaptive sociopathy as the cause of our problems, rather than say global coordination problems. He is also completely off the deep end on climate change as existential risk, sneering at anyone who disagrees, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmHh-cshTCMT8LX0Y5wSQm8FMBhaxhQ8OlOeRLkXIF0/edit#">no</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/13/18660548/climate-change-human-civilization-existential-risk">matter</a> <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eJPjSZKyT4tcSGfFk/climate-change-is-in-general-not-an-existential-risk">how</a> <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/will-climate-change-wipe-out-humanity-opinion-1440384">well-informed</a>.

<blockquote>there’s no denying that pretty much every problem in the biosphere hails from a common cause. Climate change, pollution, habitat loss, the emptying of biodiversity from land sea and air, an extinction rate unparalleled since the last asteroid and the transformation of our homeworld into a planet of weeds—all our fault, of course. There are simply too many of us. Over seven billion already, and we still can’t keep it in our pants.</blockquote>


Notice the pattern: faced with an apparent dilemma, he happily chucks the strongest, most basic principles to maintain his paranoia (the principles "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" or here "it is good for people to have children if they want, good lives have worth").

This bias would be entirely fine if he only admitted error later, about his predicted Trump race riots for instance.

<blockquote>The real danger isn’t so much Trump himself, but the fact that his victory has unleashed and empowered an army of bigoted assholes down at street level. That’s what’s gonna do the most brutal damage.</blockquote>



Most posts are entertaining but betray <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/">one-way critical thinking</a>: for some reason he can barely see the other half of the world, that we are winning in <a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/">all kinds of ways</a>. 

Lots of learned and fun film reviews here: I relax, since criticism need have no truth-value. He likes 'Arrival' more than '<a href="https://www.gwern.net/Story-Of-Your-Life">Story of Your Life</a>', which fits: the film is bombastic, paranoid, politicised, unsubtle.

<blockquote>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/oprah-winfrey-swiss-apology-racist-treatment">you</a> can buy the whole damn store and the street it sits on with pocket change; when you can buy the home of the asshole who just disrespected you and have it bulldozed; when you can use your influence to get that person fired in the blink of an eye and turn her social media life into a living hell—the fact that you don’t do any of those things does not mean that you’ve been oppressed. It means you’ve been merciful to someone you could just as easily squash like a bug... Marvel’s mutants are something like that. We’re dealing, after all, with people who can summon storm systems with their minds and melt steel with their eyes. Xavier can not only read any mind on the planet, he can freeze time, for fucksake. These have got to be the worst case-studies in oppression you could imagine.</blockquote>



<blockquote>it still seems a bit knee-jerky to complain about depictions of objectification in a movie explicitly designed to explore the ramifications of objectification. (You could always fall back on Foz Meadows’ rejoinder that “Depiction isn’t endorsement, but it is perpetuation”, so long as you’re the kind of person who’s willing to believe that Schindler’s List perpetuates anti-Semitism and The Handmaid’s Tale perpetuates misogyny.)</blockquote>


Watts reacts with caution and indignation to any police presence, even a compassionate visit to the homeless man sleeping in his garden. It would crude to explain away Watts' style and worldview by reference to his unusually bad luck: his flesh-eating disease, his inexplicable beatdown and prosecution by border cops, his publishing travails, his scientific and romantic flops. 

Disclaimer: I'm probably only so down on him because I got so excited by Blindsight and its promise of actual science fiction by an actual scientist. He is certainly well above-average rigour for a political blogger, and well above-average imagination for anyone. Plus a star if you're in it for the ride, the anecdotes, and not for reliable info.

Mixed. Twice as long as it should be; a lot of the ideological stuff is extremely clumsy; the protagonist isn't half as smart or decent as the book tries to make him seem. It gets to the main plot around 500 pages in(!) But some unusual virtues in here.

<blockquote>he asked what had happened to their civilization, which had embraced over a thousand light-years. They smiled kindly at his lack of comprehension and told him they were done with it. Their battle for knowledge, they said, was won; they knew everything worth knowing. What they were, therefore, had no further purpose in the context of their achievement. They were now embarked on a completely different path of development, one last final application of their glorious heritage. Life itself would become pleasant and simple. Their bodies were modifying and adapting, melding to fit perfectly with a natural planetary environment. But unlike a primitive, pretechnology society, they would never starve or become ill, for this was a designed simplicity, taking advantage of everything their planet could provide. Their minds would quiet over the generations until the joy of a single sunset provided as much satisfaction as breaking down the barriers of space and time with the mental tools of mathematics and physics... closing themselves away from reality like a flower at the end of the day</blockquote>




The plot is premised on corporate freebooting: gunboat asset stripping. This always looks a bit silly (compare <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2297137492?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">Morgan</a>) but it's not historically implausible. The East India Companies did way worse things.

<blockquote>I'm offering you virtual immortality lived as a plutocrat, and you're turning that down?</blockquote>




Newton gets a full novelworth of character development, alongside massive novellas for the Simons and Denise. His self-fulfilling teen self-ostracism is extremely well-drawn, as is the total kneejerk alignment of the young man in love ("He didn't mind anything she said or did").

<blockquote>		"Why not just give them the classics like Pratchett and Tolkien?" 
"I don't think they're very relevant to today."</blockquote>



Besides that I suppose the only real achievement is humanising the villains. Even the worst of the evil corporates want great things - space exploration, humanity's transcendence.

<blockquote>Our nonreturn would damage Zantiu-Braun's interstellar operations permanently, possibly even to the point of shutting them down. That would be a catastrophe we cannot permit to happen</blockquote>



Their method - open plutocracy with property rights the only rights - is where the evil comes in. Even then, they are heavily constrained by decency and public opinion. In passing Hamilton notes that the corp regenerated the Great Barrier Reef pro bono.

The oozing and peristaltic supersoldiers are very distinctive, very gross. I doubt their suits being biological makes a lick of sense.

<blockquote>You gave me a piece of a fucking animal to eat, and you ask me what the fucking matter is. An animal! A living creature. You're fucking crazy, that's my problem... He's eating fruit. Real fruit. Off a bush. They're all bloody Regressors</blockquote>




Hamilton uses one of my least favourite tropes: the black-market hacking tool which is freely* available and cracks milspec things effortlessly, but which the military fails to adopt.

You probably know that Carrey has been loudly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JmNKGfFj7w">nihilistic</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4uajFzgXSY">hippieish</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/jim-carrey-slams-school-vaccine-806187/">radical</a> for many years. Chafing against his clown origins. Filled with <a href="http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/recent/news.php?id=2620">demons</a>, antipathy to industry, money, fame, medicine, humans.

<blockquote>		across his billion-pixel screen, the volcanic plume collapsed beneath its own mass, cascading down the sides of the digital Vesuvius. The syphilis girls, the magistrate, the young lovers and their child, all of them and their dreams, carbonized...

Dull featured and acne scarred, Nancy had been cast for the strong response she elicited in focus groups: pure pity. The producers had planted her as a moral obstacle. For the contestants, the logical move was to dispatch her quickly, without regret. But what of the debt owed the weak by the strong? What of the viewers’ delusions of morality—and the wrath that lived just beneath them?

	..."I never expected humanity was really gonna matter very much,” said Carrey. The camera panned to him. “To look for any meaning in it is a ridiculous thing. The vastness just laughs at you. How’s it go? Matter makes up three percent of the universe. The rest is dark energy or dark matter or whatever? They don’t know. They were never gonna know. Things grow and die. Fungus on a tree. Lavender in a field. What’s the meaning of lavender in a field? I’m okay with the meaninglessness. I’m okay without meaning.” 
“But we made our own meaning, didn’t we?” said Hanks. “We gave it to each other as a gift.” 
“I see what you’re saying,” said Carrey, with a shrug</blockquote>


I like a good nihilist, but this form is just the sincere logical endpoint of the new age environmental spiritualism that his fellows insincerely ape. Good for him for taking ideas seriously I guess. (Buddhist abnegation as a tactic for dealing with the fact that you don't like yourself very much.) But the book mocks all of that

<blockquote>His first job was with Deepak Chopra, leading Quantum Encounter Workshops for corporate executives. But Natchez soon found fault with Chopra’s teachings, perhaps because there was fault to be found, perhaps because he himself needed to be the alpha guru.</blockquote>




Anyway this is a relentless Gonzo memoir, by which I mean tasteless fiction which falls short of surrealism by being too obviously fake.

<blockquote>"I’m here for the joy of pulling a blade through flesh,” said Gwyneth Paltrow. “Whoa, girl,” said Goldie Hawn.</blockquote>



The standard schtick with this is to surround a few truths with fantasies (so that you don't feel sentimental, so that you have deniability, so that people laugh even as you lay the heaviest shit of your life on them). (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4568910908">Norm does it better.</a>) It's in the third person, tellingly. What feels true: the childhood poverty; the intense rankling hatred of factory work and bosses; some really vivid and unhealthy dispositions towards food, surprisingly; his affection and gratitude to Rodney Dangerfield; the analysis of comedy's social function.

<blockquote>This [mock romance with a middle-aged stranger] brought the whole room to its feet, love’s caricature sowing want of its real form in the hearts of all present—even his own...</blockquote>


And when, fleeing his burning mansion, he turns to save one item, he turns back to slapstick over the miserable moderns: "Charlie Chaplin had battled the bleak world with—what? Not a knife, not a gun. A cane. Gentle, gestural, the baton of a maestro. Chaplin’s cane, with no disrespect to Hockney, Picasso, or Basquiat, was, in this moment, what Jim Carrey most wanted to save."

<blockquote>The suggestion that Carrey was somehow insane had long been used as a tool of manipulation by his handlers. The touching of this wound enraged him now.

"You're the one casting a white guy as Mao Zedong"
"I'm casting Mao's spirit inside a white guy..."
"We live in a crumbling multiethnic Ponzi-scheme society requiring a highly policed cultural environment to avoid outright chaos. That’s the problem.” “You live in a crumbling multiethnic Ponzi-scheme society requiring whatever it was you said,” said Hopkins, refilling his Burgundy. “I—am an Englishman."</blockquote>

 (Actually he'd far more likely say Welshman.)

<blockquote>Grilled cheese sandwiches. Chasing a puck across a frozen lake. His mother in high color. Healthy, jolly. Instigating dinner-table food fights. It was understood, when she made her special cherry cheesecake, that half was to be eaten, half to be thrown. Glistening airborne cherries and her melodic laughter...</blockquote>




He depicts himself as a gluttonous, childish, resentful, lustful rube, whose turn to making serious art is itself a vain bid for status.

<blockquote>she’d found a rich, powerful star desperate to be loved. Desperate to believe. In Natchez Gushue. In Freudian confusion mistaken for destiny. In anything kinder than chaos. And gazing at his mother’s eyes set in Georgie’s face, Carrey marveled at the sheer benevolence of a creator who, working through local cable providers, would not only reveal but deliver her to him... 
Within six months they had arranged for permanent karmic joining with a Melanesian spirit ceremony, held at Kelsey Grammer’s home in the Malibu Hills...

		Use it!” cried Kaufman. “Eat with your hands! Feed the glutton!” So Carrey clawed his fingers, snatching up greasy braids of noodles and stuffing them into his mouth. Hopkins cheered. “They starve while you gorge! Just as it was with Mao, dancing in Shanghai as the peasants ate their children.”... 	What is Mao but the father of modern capitalism?... gnawing, chomping, feeding, sucking, guided by an inner roaring until that roaring quieted, and then he fell asleep, belly full, animal cells fed.


	...a deep-fake video that had, almost overnight, gained such virality as to merit concern. Somewhere in the Korean peninsula a tech-savvy pervert had feminized Carrey’s features... Was this a pent-up transsexual drive finally given outlet? Or merely a particularly intense expression of masturbation’s guiding narcissism. Far from wanting to sue anyone, Carrey longed only to pass through the screen...

He’d planned to give a dinner toast laced with Marxist criticisms, comments against American capitalism, vampiric imperialism, just edgy enough to scare off the Disney execs, his class enemies, the same who’d crushed his father, who’d have broken him in the Toronto factories if he hadn’t escaped. Now he decided to make the air truly unbreathable for them. He rose from his chair, bone-dry desert wind rustling...
</blockquote>


The rest of it is just reusing the same gag: celebrities you like being violent ideologues.

<blockquote>Nicolas Cage served as Jim's Spirit Witness... Stripped down to their briefs, sun low in the west, they circled each other in a black-sand dojo ringed with mastodon skeletons that Cage had won in Mongolian auctions... The sun poured raspberry through the ancient ribs, striping Cage's face in shadow and fire. Pleased with this visual effect, he made his plea... Taller and thus favored by the physics of combat, Carrey lunged at [Nic] Cage, who fought dirty, gouging Carrey’s eyes, saying if blindness was what he sought it was easily achieved. Carrey peeled Cage’s hands off his eyes; Cage peeled Carrey’s hands from his own hands... "We battle ancient mojo in my black-sand shadow dojo" said Cage...</blockquote>



The world ends, a Truman Show terminated by its alien showrunners. The aliens are critics, paparazzi, media executives: "Fuck the critics! Fuck the tabloids! Fuck you bastards for hounding me across space and time."

In real life and here, Carrey is able to see the dark world and not make excuses for it, not deny it, and not lie about it to make people comfortable and so profit from them. This is a remarkable achievement for anyone, let alone a celebrity. But he is not able to go to the stage after that, acting against it. (To be fair, I laughed every time he redid Gwyneth Paltrow as sadistic blood geek, "Nic’s last claim, to past lives, is not scientifically verifiable,” said Gwyneth Paltrow. “But the rest checks out"... "	Make those alien cunts confetti,” said Gwyneth Paltrow, clapping her hands. The battle paint was changing her. “Dance to the music of their agony.")

Dana Vachon, the [co]writer seems to have just edited together the rants: "They Skyped constantly, Carrey spewing ideas, Vachon struggling to turn them into cohesive prose. That process continued regularly for nearly a decade, ending only in February with a final draft."

<blockquote>Carrey smiled to think he’d ever thought he was a person at all. What a ludicrous delusion. What colossal labor. How exhausting, to be a self. To keep the Ponzi fed, with words, with feats, with playing at exceptionalism.</blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29036)">"The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History"</a></h3>

John M. Barry (2005)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2017<br>
<br>
Rousing history of one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll">worst</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics">things</a> that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.

Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with <b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875246">25-100</a></b> million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:

<blockquote>  It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.</blockquote>


Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133682">weird habit</a> of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4024220/">a thousand times</a> <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/202871/number-of-fatalities-by-terrorist-attacks-worldwide/">more lethal</a>.)

So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).

Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140123-spanish-flu-1918-china-origins-pandemic-science-health/">human displacements</a>. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.

The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:

<blockquote>
Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.

By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.
</blockquote>


There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was "the withered arm of science". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, "we can't really do anything") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.

<blockquote>
Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.</blockquote>


Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.

Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae">the wrong pathogen</a>, due to a bad guess by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Friedrich_Johannes_Pfeiffer">extremely eminent researcher</a>.

Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:

<blockquote>In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. 

The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.

When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...

Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.

Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...
The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”
</blockquote>


Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.

<blockquote>The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.

The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow...<br> More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. "</blockquote>

- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.


Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. ("at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/germany-telegraphs-president-wilson-seeking-armistice">with the Kaiser's new parliament</a> in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?dcr=0&q=18000000+%2F+1559+*+70&oq=18000000+%2F+1559+*+70&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1761.1839.0.1945.2.2.0.0.0.0.87.87.1.1.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..2.0.0.UNPLBXOgOHQ">800,000</a> completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.

<blockquote> the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. </blockquote>



Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_of_1918">ban on criticising the government</a>. But then there's the unofficial "patriotic duties", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.

<blockquote>By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.

He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.

He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_L._Berger">a congressman</a>.

He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...

Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect..."

In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.

Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...

If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources.

...the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.</blockquote>



Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:

<blockquote>In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...

The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”

The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs.  The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. </blockquote>



---
Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having "no standards for admission":

<blockquote>  In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
</blockquote>


But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.

I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)

Another history of the origins of science: our long trek to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study">GWAS</a>, <a href="http://chemistry.about.com/od/periodictable/fl/Scientists-Complete-the-Periodic-Table.htm">livermorium</a>, and <a href="https://home.cern/about/experiments">CERN</a> via astrology, natural magic, alchemy, Neoplatonism, herbalism, occultism, and philosophy. So, superficially, the book is just about an especially  <a name="people"></a>fruity context of discovery. But this period holds two of the most important lessons in history: 1) science grew out of work by people who diverge wildly from the modern idea and practice of science, whose variously false frameworks led to the Royal Society and e.g. the Newtonian triumph. (And from there to contemporary, professional, university science.) So wrong people can still make progress if their errors are uncorrelated with the prevailing errors. And, 2) a small number of the most powerful people in Britain - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon">Lord Chancellor</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Scarborough">king's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey#Excursions_abroad.2C_election_as_physician_to_Charles_I_and_the_English_Civil_War">physicians</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkins">the chaplain</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_Louis,_Elector_Palatine">young Elector Palatine</a> and bishop of Chester, London's great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren#Architectural_career">architect</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moray">Privy Councillors</a> <a href="#bigfrankb">*</a> - successfully pushed a massive philosophical change, and thereby contributed to most of our greatest achievements: smallpox eradication, Sputnik and Voyager, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a>, and the unmanageably broad boons of computing are partly theirs. 

The received view of all this is one-dimensional: you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_Concerning_the_Two_Chief_World_Systems">superstitious, pompous cretins</a> at one end and rational, experimental moderns at the other.

But really you need five axes before you get a basic understanding of the great, great revolution that began in the C16th - before you can see how science differs from every other community: 



<ul>
<li><b>Supernaturalism vs Naturalism</b>. Did they explain things solely in terms of natural causes? (Absentee Gods only.)</li>
<li><b>Apriori vs Aposteriori</b>. Did they view actual observation as decisive and indispensable? <a href="#empiricism">**</a></li>
<li><b>Qualitative vs Quantitative.</b> Did they make measurements? Did they model the data? Did they use standard units?</li>
<li><b>Holism vs Reductionism.</b> Did they analyse things into their constituent features? Did they explain phenomena in terms of ?</li>
<li><b>Infallibilism vs Fallibilism.</b> Did they allow for the possibility of error? Did they view uncertain knowledge as still worthwhile? <a href="#fallibilism">***</a></li>
****
</ul>^

So I'm modelling science as naturalist, fallibilist, quantitative empiricism with pretensions to openness. I've categorised the early scientists mentioned in Curiosity according to this: you can see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Bw1pqa-ZcGza9P3jV7wht8o9-xEJw0A0GpdN733MqE/edit?usp=sharing">the data with additional justifications here</a>. (Ball doesn't state this model, but it floats around in his debunkings and "well actually"s.)

All of the pieces of science are very ancient - we had mathematics and data collection <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322">well before the Ten Commandments</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus">naturalism</a> before Buddha and Confucius, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism#Greek_atomism">reductionism</a> before the Peloponnesian War at least <a href="http://tunesforbears.com/a-history-of-randomization/">one controlled trial</a> centuries before Christ, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/carneades/#3">fallibilism</a> likewise. Everything was ready BCE; we can see indirect evidence of this in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile">astonishing</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_screw">works</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesibius#Inventions">of</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byzantium#Devices">Ancient Greek</a> engineers, mostly unmatched for 1000 years until y'know. 

So the question is not "was Bacon the most original blah blah?": he wasn't, particularly when you remember Alhazen's Baconian method, developed in the C11th. But we need an explanation for how we messed it up so badly. The received view, which is all I have at the moment, is that the fall of Rome, Christian anti-intellectualism and, later, the enshrining of Aristotelian mistakes was enough to destroy and suppress the ideas. I want deeper explanations though. (For instance, what did we do to the economy?)

A fun regression on this data would be to see how my scienciness measure correlates with the importance of the person's work. It would not be that highly proportional, in this time period. 





Back to the book eh! Book structure is lots of little chapters on fairly disjointed topics: early modern ideas of space travel, universal language, pumps, etc. Chapter on "cabinets of curiosity" is great though: suddenly their dull zany blare makes sense and I want to build one:

<blockquote>
this was more than a case of 'look what I've got'. The power with which Wunderkammern were imbued was... in that they created their own complete microcosm: a representation of the world in miniature... By possessing this microcosm the collector-prince was not just symbolising but also in a sense exercising his mastery of the world. The cabinet acted as a kind of mental laboratory within which the relationships between things could be contemplated via a process that shared elements of both experimentation and Gnostic revelation.
</blockquote>


Ball doesn't like us calling the Scientific Revolution a revolution, and I agree: the revolution didn't consist in the theories of Bacon or Newton: it consists in the diffusion of the worldview into all subjects and all inquiry. It transformed society and gave us marvels, but it hasn't finished happening. The general will, or default state, is still strongly unscientific. (The largest and most grievous holdout, larger even than the enduring hold of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fideism">fideist</a> religion, is our tribal politics and our largely nonempirical government policy.)

Ball expends a lot of time on a history of wonder vs curiosity vs dispassionate robot inquiry. People hated all of these things for various reasons, up until the Renaissance when curiosity became acceptable on what are now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_skies_research">classic economic grounds</a>, or in line with the Italian cult of the virtuoso - someone who's so bloody brilliant that you have to just let him get on with it.

I always like Ball's drawling prose and catty editorialising. (For instance, Margaret Cavendish - the darling of arts academics who latch on to the only woman in sight in this period - gets a round dissing by Ball, as an anti-experiment idiot, a vitalist, and a misogynist.) Stimulating as always.



* Bacon has some claim to being the most influential philosopher ever, in terms of counterfactual effect on history. (Rather than number of bloody citations!) No-one with his social standing was resisting the Aristotelian consensus in 1620; his prototype scientific method is a century ahead of its time. (Yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham#Scientific_method">ibn al-Haytham</a>'s was 7 centuries ahead of its time, but to limited avail.)<a href="#people">⏎</a>
<a name="empiricism"></a> 

** This one is hard to refer to, because we now find it incredibly easy to understand why "go and look" works as a general route to knowledge; Medieval thought rejected this on the basis of things like the problem of induction. 

The cliched way to refer to the split between those who want to start with the apriori and those who want to start with data is "Rationalism" vs "Empiricism". But these words <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/27/why-i-am-not-rene-descartes/">confuse people</a>: the two of them are also used in a C17th debate about psychology, to do with the nature of mental content. 

More: it can't be a dichotomy, since many of the greatest rationalists (Descartes, Leibniz) were experimentalists too, doing what we now call empirical work. Three meanings of rationalism, and three words for them:


<ul><li>'Rationalism<sub>1</sub>': Belief in innate ideas. Call it 'Continental Rationalism'. Descartes and Leibniz but not Dawkins and Shermer.</li>
<li>'Rationalism<sub>2</sub>': Belief in the supremacy of apriori knowledge over empirical knowledge. Call it 'apriorism'. Aristotle was apriorist, as was Descartes.</li>
<li>'Rationalism<sub>3</sub>': Belief that everything should be subject to reason and evidence. Includes Descartes and Leibniz and Dawkins and Shermer. Contemporary rationalists are highly if not radically empiricist.</li>
</ul>


I use <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2011/07/leibniz-experimental-philosopher/">Alberto Vanzo</a>'s criteria for deciding if someone was enough of an experimentalist:

<blockquote><blockquote> let us consider four typical features of early modern experimental philosophers:



<ul><li>self-descriptions: experimental philosophers typically called themselves such. At the very least, they professed their sympathy towards experimental philosophy.</li>
   <li>friends and foes: experimental philosophers saw themselves as part of a tradition whose “patriarch” was Bacon and whose sworn enemy was Cartesian natural philosophy.</li>
<li>method: experimental philosophers put forward a two-stage model of natural philosophical inquiry: first, collect data by means of experiments and observations; second, build theories on the basis of them. In general, experimental philosophers emphasized the a posteriori origins of our knowledge of nature and they were wary of a priori reasonings.</li>
<li>rhetoric: in the jargon of experimental philosophers, the terms “experiments” and “observations” are good, “hypotheses” and “speculations” are bad. They were often described as fictions, romances, or castles in the air.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>


This is unusually inclusive: the famous Rationalist Leibniz counts as experimental under this rubric. But a stronger definition of aposteriorist - like "refuses to use purely analytic reasoning", or even "spent most of their time running experiments and analysing data" would exclude many contemporary scientists. Sticking with Vanzo for now.  <a href="#model">⏎</a>

<a name="fallibilism"></a>




*** Hard to imagine a fallibilist apriorist: perhaps Lakatos. (Some say Leibniz was, in practice.) I actually have met a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism_(philosophy)">methodist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_skepticism">infallibilist apriorist</a>, but I won't meet another.  <a href="#model">⏎</a>
<a name="openness"></a>


**** I had included "openness" in the model -


<ul>
<li><b>Obscurantism vs Openness.</b> Did they write in the vernacular? Did they publish for a wide readership? Did they spurn Noble Lies? Did they encourage replications with and data sharing? Did they build scholarly networks?</li>
</ul>
- but I admit this is just wishful/normative thinking: modern academic science fails at this. Whether with its low-status replications, unreadable prose, paywalls on most research (tax-funded or no), pathetically low levels of data sharing, or the <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2015-cofnas.pdf">prevalence of noble lies</a>... But it's definitely a core aspiration now: the greedy impulse behind hermeticism is blatantly unscientific, if not actually shunned by actual scientists. First, lip service...  

Things can be science without being published, obviously: consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#History">invention of public key cryptography</a> by a GCHQ wonk, classified for 25 years - or even the secret <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Low-latency_strategies">infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Statistical_arbitrage">algorithmics</a> of high-frequency trading.

^ Obviously these five factors aren't the end of the matter either. But I reckon it catches a decent amount of the variance in the term "scientist". Others e.g.


<ul>
<li>Particularism vs Consilience. Did they believe that the scientific method could explain every phenomenon?</li>
<li>Realism vs Instrumentalism. Most scientists are realists about best current theories</li>
<li>Theism vs Nontheism</li>
</ul>
I had included non-theism in the core of modern science - and so it is, in the form of strong naturalism. Scientists, on the other hand, differ from this, globally. This is partially because humans are so compartmentalised and can hold severe contradictions indefinitely. But, clearly, atheism is not an essential part of the modern method. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_closure">causal closure</a> and (at most) a private faith are.

<br>
<blockquote>"What would you say to Jesus if you saw him on the street?" 
Erdős said he'd ask Jesus if the Continuum Hypothesis was true. "And there would be three possible answers for Jesus," Erdős said. "He could say, 'Godel and Cohen already taught you everything which is to be known about it.' The second answer would be, 'Yes, there is an answer but unfortunately your brain isn't sufficiently developed yet to know the answer.' And Jesus could give a third answer: 'The Father, the Holy Ghost, and I have been thinking about that long before creation, but we haven't yet come to a conclusion.'</blockquote>


A life of a saint. Not in the sense of a moral paragon - though he was very kind when he wasn't being stubborn - but in the sense of a man devoted to, possessed by one thing, a high and rare thing that sets him some way beyond society. No money, no fixed abode, no lovers, no children, no religion. 80% of his family eaten by Nazi Germany. And yet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_things_named_after_Paul_Erd%C5%91s">a glorious, constructive</a>, hilarious life. A champion moocher, eternal couchsurfer, generous and ascetic, witty and worldly. We are lucky to have had him.

<blockquote>I [Hoffman] slept where he slept and stayed up nineteen hours a day, watching him prove and conjecture. I felt silly not being able, at the age of thirty, to keep up with a sickly looking seventy-three-year-old man. I suppose I could have shared his pills, but the only stimulant I took was caffeine.</blockquote>


<blockquote>He abhorred discussions of sex as much as he disliked the act itself... In the late 1940s, during the Chinese civil war, Erdős took part in a food drive for the Communist Chinese. "I remember walking into a big room in Los Angeles, at UCLA, I think," said Vazsonyi, "and there was Erdős and all these people making packages of food. Some mischief-makers who knew of his disgust at naked women offered to make a $100 donation if he'd go with them to a burlesque show." To their astonishment, he immediately took them up on the offer. Afterwards, when they forked over the $100, he revealed the secret of his victory: "See! I tricked you, you trivial beings! I took off my glasses and did not see a thing!"</blockquote>



Unlike <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2664633920">Perelman</a>, the other late-C20th-century mathematical saint, Erdős had a wicked sense of fun and style. Like him, Erdős let himself be completely dependent on others for housing and logistics, and demanded much of them.

<blockquote>he expected his hosts to lodge him, feed him, and do his laundry, along with anything else he needed, as well as arrange for him to get to his next destination.
</blockquote>



<blockquote>Erdos started developing his private language... referring to Communists as people "on the long wave-length," because in the electromagnetic spectrum the red waves were long. He said that Horthy supporters and other Fascist sympathizers were "on the short wavelength." That's also when he started calling children and other small things "epsilons," grandchildren "epsilons squared," alcohol "poison," music "noise," and women "bosses," an inversion of what Hungarian women often called their husbands. "Give me an epsilon of poison," Erdos would say when he wanted a sip of wine. "Wine, women, and song" became "Poison, bosses, and noise."
</blockquote>



<blockquote>He then had a huge argument with the surgeon about why, since only one eye was being deadened [during his cornea transplant], he couldn't read a mathematics journal with the other, good eye. The surgeon made a series of frantic calls to the Memphis math department. "Can you send a mathematician over here at once so that Erdos can talk math during surgery?" The department obliged, and the operation went smoothly.
</blockquote>



Unfortunately only half of this is anecdotes about Erdős, the rest being the usual potted-history of quirky mathematicians (Archimedes the oblivious, Fermat the executioner, Gauss the crabbed, Hardy the dry eccentric, Ramanujan the sublime, Wiles the Stakhanovite) with the usual stories.  I skimmed these bits to get more of the good stuff.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10388040)">"Perfect Rigour: A Genius And The Mathematical Breakthrough Of The Century"</a></h3>

Masha Gessen (2011)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2019<br>
<br>
Not so much a biography: instead a study of recent Russian anti-Semitism, the viciousness of Soviet academia, and but also the wonderful alternative subculture that lived uneasily within it. This subculture hid inside the superhuman apolitical dreamland, mathematics.* It could only exist because of the sacrifices of famous and decent men, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3376">Kolmogorov</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Danilovich_Aleksandrov">Aleksandrov</a>. Their selective maths schools seem to have been the only nice places to be in the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Empire">empire</a>, for any intellectual with a taste for actual discourse, or for the truth.

(Reasons it can't be so much a biography: the subject refused to talk to her, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman#Possible_withdrawal_from_mathematics">does things</a> that are very hard to explain, and doesn't go out much.)

The teacher Ryzhik's story about the evil entrance exam he sat is so, so sad:

<blockquote>  “Coffins” were questions specially designed for the Jewish applicants... rejection was administered in a peculiarly sadistic way... if [Jews] succeeded in answering correctly the two or three questions on the ticket, then, alone in the room with the examiners, they would be casually issued an extra question... a problem not merely complex but unsolvable. The examiners would then nail the cover of the coffin shut: the Jewish applicant had failed the exam...

"They did not even manage to find a problem I couldn't solve; I sat for three hours after the exam was over, I solved them all, and still they failed me. I was just a boy. I went home and cried."
</blockquote>



Gessen is well-placed to write this - she was a maths nerd in Soviet Russia around the same time. As far as I can tell (which isn't very far) her grasp of the maths (one chapter for the crown jewel) is fit for purpose. But Gessen is out to bust Perelman's reputation for hyper-individualism; so she focusses on the devoted teachers and functionaries that pulled strings to get an abrasive Jew into the heart of Soviet academia, and his incredible luck in starting graduate study just as Glasnost happened.

She wants to highlight the poverty of his character - his antisocial withdrawal, his complete and intentional ignorance of politics, his naivete, his savantism. It doesn't work. Yes, he's rigid; maybe he is composed of a curiosity, a competitiveness, an ethics, and nothing else (no vanity, humour, romance, charisma, empathy, theory of mind, tolerance, compromise, doubt). 

So what? Why does everyone need to be rounded? Does she sneer at athletes, the other people with lives this seemingly contorted and simple? <a href="https://www.esquire.com/sports/a5151/the-string-theory-david-foster-wallace/">David Foster Wallace</a> managed to get over himself, on this note:

<blockquote>
The restrictions on [pro tennis player's] life have been, in my opinion, grotesque; and in certain ways Joyce himself is a grotesque. But the radical compression of his attention and sense of himself have allowed him to become a transcendent practitioner of an art – something few of us get to be. They've allowed him to visit and test parts of his psychic reserves most of us do not even know for sure we have (courage, playing with violent nausea, not choking, et cetera).

Joyce is, in other words, a complete man, though in a grotesquely limited way. 
</blockquote>



Gessen is, to be frank, quite cruel: she never passes up an opportunity to mention appearances - that that athletic boy of 1970 is "now an overweight and balding computer scientist", that the house of a man caring for his wife with late-stage dementia is "a messy place, lived in awkwardly" and he himself "similarly unkempt"; that Perelman didn't change his underwear or clip his nails as a teen. This is the shallow side of the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/masha-gessen">New Yorker</a> style on show - or else the malign side of Russian honesty. Either way fuck it. (Though Perelman would probably approve.)

<blockquote>
   [Perelman] sounded his voice only if a solution required his intervention; looked forward to Sundays, sighing happily and saying that he could "finally solve some problems in peace"; and, if asked, patiently explained any math issue to any of his classmates though apparently utterly unable to conceive of anyone not comprehending such a simple thing. His classmates repaid him with kindness: they recalled his civility and his mathematics, and none ever mentioned to me that he walked around with his shoelaces undone...
</blockquote>



The great mystery, which Gessen understandably can't touch, is why after 36 years of focus he suddenly stopped doing the only thing he'd ever done. How could he? How can that much momentum be shed? What does such a man do next?

Subtract a star if you don't care about maths or if you can't abide people being mean to nerds (as both the old apparatchiks and Gessen were).

---

* One of the oddest things about Perelman, because it maybe explains him turning down a million quid and the highest honours the world can bestow, is that he'd disagree with that sentence: maths, the least animal and least irrational thing we have, is too political for him. There was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau#Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture_controversy">a little bit</a> of nasty jostling at the time of the announcement - but nothing compared to any other science, let alone any government. Maybe the bubble everyone set up for him was bad for him, because it robbed him of perspective and so made the mild case of fuckery seem like a complete invalidation of mathematical culture. But maybe a rigorous rule-based mind would always explode eventually even given a scale to measure instances of bias.

There's: a huge war over economic policy; a primitivist misotheist theocracy; a bunch of murderous millenarians; a group of solipsist mercenaries who each think they're the only person in the world; a World Tree ecology; a giant raft city; a talking deus ex machina; two world conspiracies; a man raised from birth to be the perfect revolutionary leader; the fall of a trillionaire dynasty; terrible, maximally vicious sibling rivalry; a beautiful android city full of likeable people being competent and deep. The protagonists pull off about a dozen missions in varied landscapes with various goals. But it's all just sketched, since the 12 worlds he builds are vying for the same 700 pages.

<blockquote>We are a race prone to monsters, and when we produce one we worship it. What kind of world, what translation of good could come from all that's happened here?
</blockquote>


And I didn't like any of the protagonists; they're all a glib kind of hedonist. The leader, Sharrow, is tacitly remorseful about the many terrible things she does, but at no point does she stop doing them.

<blockquote>People were always sorry... The sorrow never stopped them; it just made them feel better. And so the sorrow never stopped.
</blockquote>



<spoiler>The dastardly ubermensch Big Bad only appears in the last 5% of the book.</spoiler>
<spoiler>Killing Geis with a bullet she wouldn't have if she were more responsible is one way to justify her attitude I guess.</spoiler>
<spoiler>In killing Geis, Sharrow saves the World Court, or anyway the Court/Rebel States status quo. The ending doesn't resolve anything, fine, but I was amazed that we didn't have her recovering the Gun. It's one thing to leave ambiguity about what's next, but it's not really clear what Sharrow's options are. She lost her crew, killed her family (including the son), is no longer hunted by the Huhsz, gets Feril boxed for a century, has a prosecution coming, and doesn't give a fuck about anything. But she has a cool motorbike.</spoiler>
<spoiler>Bank's scifi is unusually emotionally fraught, focussed on inner life. Sharrow vs Breyguhn is very tragic and quite believable, for all that it makes me dismiss Sharrow as an impulsive heartless fool.</spoiler>

* The Huhsz, the millenarians, are actually quite marginal, despite the first 200 pages setting them up to be central.
* Odd portrait of a very advanced (10000 year old), fairly stable capitalism. They manage to ban things (like bioweapons), and manage to prosecute trillionaires.
* Feril goes straight in the all-time gallery of Wise Cinnamon-bun AIs we don't deserve. (Along with Lt Cmd Data, Constable Dorfl, TARS, Iron Giant, GCU Grey Area, Wall-E).
* I didn't buy the superior ancient tech thing, here. Golter has a mostly-functional academic and state apparatus, and is able to do many things we can't; it's implausible that they wouldn't manage to reverse-engineer things over thousands of years
* Nice echoing of the Solipsists in Sharrow at the end:

<blockquote>The blood pumped and coursed within her, and with each beat the whole edifice seemed to quake and pulse and shiver, as though for all its mountainous solidity the Sea House was merely a projection, something held in the power of her blood-quickened eyes.
</blockquote>


* The Lazy Guns sound exactly like Culture tech, quasi-sentient to boot. But their presence in this remote "orphan" system is odd, and it doesn't fit to have the Culture either dump or lose such weapons.

Banks is less subtle than I thought he was, as a teen. Good if you prefer worlds to characters.

Daniel Suarez (2019)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2019<br>
<br>
Hopeful and precise. Surprisingly moving, in the second half anyway. The prose is flat, economical, and repetitive (for instance, every time the characters do <a href="http://blogs.esa.int/alexander-gerst/2014/10/07/how-to-get-rid-of-nitrogen/">pre-emptive oxygen saturation</a> before a spacewalk, Suarez tells you so), but if you like space or engineering detail you'll be fine. It's billed as (very) hard scifi, but there was actually less physics and more economics in it than I was expecting (and still too much kinematic exposition for most readers, I guess). It's "hard" in the sense that every technology in this already exists in some form, if only prototype or protoprototype, that every celestial body mentioned exists in that location, that the energy budget of the crew is taken seriously - "gravity wells are for suckers" - that their (even safety-critical) software has many terrible bugs. <spoiler>(Though I thought this was implausible:

<blockquote>The flight suits were meant only for short, emergency EVAs, but without access to the ship's network, the clam suits' high-tech helmets were inert.
</blockquote>

)
Why not completely local processing? Why not use the lo-tech visor instead?</spoiler>

The most moving part was <spoiler>Nicole's euthanasia scene, though the anguish of Goff's stupid robots and extortion is also quite big</spoiler>. Some of the most important things in the world rely on sacrifice, and really we should be more moved by the death of an asteroid miner than that of a soldier in a typical war. One is driving the species forward, one is crab-wrestling in a bucket. 

Why is space so moving? Well there's the stated reason, via Hawking:

<blockquote>
With climate change, overdue asteroid strikes, epidemics, and population growth, our own planet is increasingly precarious.
</blockquote>


But does this argument from reduction of existential risk go through? Probably not - most x-risk is due to us, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCfLheUxHEI">not volcanoes or asteroids or gamma bursts</a>, and we should expect this kind of risk to reduce only modestly in a multiplanetary setting, since the act of colonisation carries the risk source, us, with it; and there are much cheaper and more developed ways of preventing extinction, like arms control and AI research. And we're (even) more likely to have large conflicts when the cultural distances, between planetary civilisations, are so much larger. 

So what? Is it our genes, new-pastures wanderlust? The sheer scale? 

There's a lot of ostentation in the book, unnecessary mentions of Zegna suits and fancy watches and whatnot (perhaps intended to make us suspicious of the investors and lawyers who wear them - but we already have them admitting that they are motivated by egomania and envy). The billionaire at the heart of the plot is a suitable mix of inspirational, reckless, authoritarian, noble, ignoble. 

Props to Suarez for using <a href="http://spaceengine.org/">SpaceEngine</a> and <a href="https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/">Kerbal</a> to model the precise trajectory of his crew, though many extra points would have accrued had he open-sourced the run, for the purposes of scientific hermeneutics. Also for his bibliography and dissing <a href="https://www.space.com/21554-mars-toxic-perchlorate-chemicals.html">Mars colonisation</a>. 

Suarez' claim that a single asteroid trip could make a trillion dollars is contradicted in <a href="http://www.weeklyweinersmith.com/?p=858">the Weinersmith's pop book</a>, where they emphasise the legal headaches, and that the profits are conditional on a huge increase in human space activity (otherwise not much demand for your LEO wares). This is all I know, and it's not very strong evidence either way.





How does it do as Serious science fiction?

Social development: None. One thing which doesn't happen much IRL is the <spoiler>financial and literal suicide mission by a billionaire for the purposes of driving humanity forward</spoiler>, but this is just ordinary audacity scaled up. I like the extrapolation of <a href="https://space-agency.public.lu/en.html">Luxembourg</a>'s space industry, the ultimate colonial underwriting. The secret construction of a spaceship in HEO is implausible at the moment but might not be in a few decades.

Software development: Yes! The mission is almost lost several times due to software problems, and Ade is the most critical crewmember because of his top monkeypatching and hacking skills (hacking in both senses).

Actual science: Yes. The gravity ship is actually basic physics, just incredibly hard and expensive engineering (Joyce drops something like $45bn on the project, which sounds about right). The economic argument about moving and constructing everything outside of gravity wells seems incontrovertible to me.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1602908)">"Information: The New Language of Science"</a></h3>

Hans Christian Von Baeyer (2004)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2019<br>
<br>
Elementary philosophy of science focussing on Wheeler's "<a href="http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/3138/1/Really%20Big%20Questions.pdf">Really Big Questions</a>" about the foundations of physics, in particular the 'digital physics'. (The Questions are ‘How come existence?’, ‘Why the quantum?’, ‘It from bit?’, ‘What makes meaning?’) 

Which wasn't what I was expecting from an out-of-print hardback tome by a serious physicist - particularly with that grand title - but still: nice. In fact it's hard to imagine anyone writing out these first steps any friendlier (ok, maybe <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/">Ben Orlin</a>). Its technical work feels effortless; think Schroedinger's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F">What is Life?</a> (which von Baeyer actually corrects, in passing).

I needed a book on the method / meta-field surrounding mathematical "information", because it has surrounded me: it threatens to encompass science. Just as "energy" eventually became a unifying pillar of all the natural sciences, information has infiltrated that same salient: 

Energy <-> Entropy <-> Information. 

And then into other sciences: vB hints that we should see bits as money as ML-performance as Fisher information as VNM utility, which would seize about half of theoretical science.

Info theory is a core part of a mathematico-philosophical witch's brew: computability, decision theory, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf">computational complexity</a>, <a href="http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/GaussianModel/JaynesProbabilityTheory.pdf">Bayesian statistics</a>, digital physics, quantum computing. Which together take big steps towards the naturalisation of logic - or, more, of maths - or more, of thought. (And is information larger than thought?) And/or the dematerialisation of physics?

von Baeyer builds it all up, so we get Clausius (1852) for thermodynamics, Boltzmann (1877) for entropy (inverse info) as a proper physical object, Shannon (1930) for classical info theory, Solomonoff (1960) for algorithmic complexity, Landauer for the shocking physics of computation (1961), Bekenstein (1971) and Hawking for black hole theory (crucial experiments for it-from-bit), Deutsch (1985) for how quantum computing could work. And Wheeler setting the whole new agenda. (I call it new because it hasn't made it into undergraduate philosophy, or physics, or statistics, or ordinary computer science, yet.)

The philosophy is very well done. I really liked his physicist's optimism about reflective equilibrium between science and folk physics:

<blockquote>Information, too, has been defined operationally. Unfortunately, this technical, bottom-up definition is very restricted, and hitherto bears little resemblence to any of the common, top-down definitions. Eventually the two definitions should converge, but that hasn't happened yet. When it does, we will finally know what information is. 
</blockquote>


It impresses me to find a pop science book that has aged this well, over 16 years. It's sad that that's impressive - obviously I'm not reading enough physics and maths. Von Baeyer maybe leans too hard on the physics-is-solid heuristic; he ends up being uncritical about some extremely late-breaking and radical work: the heterodox classical theory of <a href="http://www.matheory.info/chapter1.html">Kahre</a> (2002) and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018820410908">Zeilinger's</a> (1999) grand quietist explanation for QM's weirdness (neither of which I've heard much about since).

<blockquote>Zeilinger's principle... furnishes an answer to Wheeler's famous question "Why the quantum?" Why does nature seems granular, discontinuous, quantized into discrete chunks like sand..? The answer is that while we have no idea how the world is really arranged, and shouldn't even ask, we do know that knowledge of the world is information: and since information is naturally quantized into bits, the world also appears quantized. If it didn't, we wouldn't be able to understand it. It's both as simple and as profound as that.

A second prediction of QM that is explained... is the randomness of the outcomes of some measurements... if the single bit of information in an elementary system is revealed, then there is no more information left over to answer additional experimental questions... so other independent measurements must have random answers.
</blockquote>


Each chapter takes an idea ("heat and entropy", "logarithms and message space", "qubits", "Morse and optimality") and builds it up with little informal proofs and thought experiments. This is nice, but because it has to do everything from scratch it's more of a grab-bag than an argument, and certainly not a "language of science" by the end. For instance, he stops short of one key philosophical outcome of all this technical talk, which is that there are two types of explanations, even though he covers all the ideas you'd need:

1) information compressions (e.g. General relativity explains the force on all of the infinite points in spacetime in one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations#Mathematical_form">unbelievably terse tensor equation</a>. We can often count the bits used by theories like this, and so solve theory selection!)

2) simplified algorithms, faster ways to reason about the world (e.g. much of computer science)

As you can tell from the number of question marks in this review, I found this stimulating but not conclusive. But it would be foolish to expect a pop book to answer the Really Big Questions, and von Baeyer's reminds us frequently that the current answers he presents are unfinished. So this is step one of a currently unbounded algorithm. Minus a half for not quite taking things as far as they can go.

Misc notes

* This would be a pretty good primer for <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality">Map and Territory</a> or <a href="">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a>, if those assume too much for you.

* Lots of literary illustrations of scientific ideas - Calvino, Wittgenstein, Borges - but it didn't feel forced to me. I suppose it might actually reduce the friendliness, for some readers.

* Is this true?:

<blockquote>The most important role of noise, however, is as the preserver of our sanity. Without noise, the measurement or observation of a single quantity would requite an infinite memory and an infinite amount of time - it would overload all our circuits. Neither science nor consciousness could exist... noise is a thick blanket of snow which softens the contours into large, rounded mounds we can perceive and sort out without being overwhelmed.
</blockquote>


We evolved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Gigerenzer#Heuristics">lots of ways</a> to ignore information. Why would this not happen again? A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye#Early_eyes">photosensitive patch</a> arises in that noiseless world; since it is an analogue processor it simply trims off the infinite information by default when it runs out of molecules or reactions(?)

* He calls the Bayesian interpretation of probability "the rational approach" which suits me but let's imagine that's a mistranslation of his meaning "the mental approach", "the personalist approach".


* Gleick handles the social history and applications with unsurpassed skill, but I wanted the mind-bending crunchy side, natural information, digital physics, information as everything.

* "Information is flow of form"

* <a href="https://bethzero.com/2019/07/09/12-why-kolmogorov-complexity-is-useless/">Solomonoff induction is intractable</a>, another word for practically useless. Does this change the philosophical significance of the above brew? I don't think so - "Here is a way to work everything out; you can almost never use it" is a pretty plausible way for philosophy to end tbf. Does it change its scientific significance? Yes, absolutely - we have to seek approximations of the forbidden ideal or else it has none.

* What's fundamental, thermodynamics or information? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics">Neither</a>?

* Yet another way that info theory eats the life of the mind is the deeply practical "value of information", a way of deciding whether to bother with an experiment (q.v. the master, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xiojTDJP6FWdb2Fmb/value-of-information-8-examples">Gwern</a>).

<br>
Fun, highly dated in ways that I find charming rather than vitiating (e.g. he has to explain to us what a hard disk is). His depiction of software, that <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/-civilization-is-built-on-code">ineliminable agent of our present and our future</a>, is still better than 95% of scifi and 99.9% of lit-fic.

The plot is so clunky and over-the-top that Stephenson needs to actually embody all the necessary exposition in the form of a scholar personal assistant (which I would give bags of cash to have).

I fail to see what's satirical about it; certainly I know Stephenson doesn't believe that Sumerian is a neurolinguistic virus - but author disbelief is not sufficient for satire. Is he satirising Julian Jaynes? Cyberpunk? Hacker supremacism? If so, he failed because Snow Crash is a vivid and sympathetic instance of these things.

<blockquote>Heaven and earth... do not govern themselves, so how could they govern other things?</blockquote>



Extremely interesting, radical, wrong. (There is an unambiguous fallacy on page 2: "humans share many predicates with animals therefore humans are no different from animals.") Primitivist, relativist, reclusionist, quasi-anarchist, sceptical, brutal. Original affluence bs. "I neglect the rites" - i.e. anti-confucianism. (But not anti-Confucius - he uses Confucius as an exemplar of several extreme Daoist virtues like equanimity and wuwei.) Like modern real anarchists, he is a broom to sweep away badness but nothing to live by.

Importantly, this sage is not virtuous or interested in promoting standard moral virtue. His stories are not fairytales or morality plays. Hypocrisy, realpolitik and contempt for rulers and society alike. The four wise men who come down the mountain to adjudicate a succession crisis favour the legendarily cruel Empress Lü - so that she will not destroy them in retaliation. They then refuse her honours and leave the kingdom to her depredations. Fan Li helps Yue destroy the kingdom of Wu, then says "In order to recompense the man who paid us our salary, we destroyed others as though it was an honourable achievement. When the most perfidious of men claim they give or take life just like heaven and earth do, and that they eliminate the harmful and establish things just like the sages do, is that not deceit?"

De Meyer:<blockquote>[the] consummate man... would look like the following... he does not create arbitrary divisions between himself and others, between humans and other animals. He makes effortless action into the very foundation of his life. He is impervious to the fear of dying, knowing that the tangible components of his person have always been dead... He does not chase noble status or power, knowing they merely amount to possessing an abundance of material things, nor is he motivated by the desire for a good reputation, knowing that the body to which the reputation is attached is impermanent. He never grant emotions a leading role, knowing that it is appropriate for humans to be oblivious of one another in naturalness, just as it is appropriate for fish to forget one another in rivers and lakes. He can be soft and flexible like water... Free of emotions and intentionality, he is an embodiment of heaven and earth... he is submerged in the Great Void )(the total absence of distinctions) and... immerses himself in nullity and concentrates on the permanent... he may choose any kind of action in everyday life, provided he is not guided by intentionality, profit, or desire.</blockquote>



* As the risk of being that guy, you could take Daoism for a protestantism to a Confucian Catholicism. Individualist, anticlerical, asocial.

* Extremely common refrain: "he died following experimentation with Daoist life-prolonging elixirs". Also: "Control his breathing and abstain from grains".

Seeing Daoism, my already-high estimate of the Mohists rises.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10267988)">"Computational Logic and Human Thinking: How to Be Artificially Intelligent"</a></h3>

Robert Kowalski (2011)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2019<br>
<br>
Nice mission: to teach computer logic to humans to help them think. (Returning logic to its normative roots.) But Kowalski immediately strays from this to also try to build "a comprehensive, logic-based theory of human intelligence". By aiming at both pragmatic self-help and grand, metaphysical, qualitative psychology, it's too ambitious - or rather, appropriately ambitious but using the wrong tools. 

(The right tools are unknown but probably include decision theory, statistics, distributed representations, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function">Bayesian</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding">predictive</a> brain - none of which Kowalski foregrounds. He talks about inferring causes - without using Causal Inference; about doing abduction - without probabilities; about production systems - without the more mature Predictive Processing calculus.)
 
Kowalski praises a few bad theories, like Fodor's version of language of thought, and Gardner's multiple intelligences. (And Cyc isn't marked as a failure.) But also good theories: dual-process psychology, Sperber's relevance theory.

The best bit is where he links cognitive biases to naive logical rules

<blockquote>The computational interpretation [of dual process theory] is that, when an agent is deliberative, its behaviour is controlled by a high-level program, which manipulates symbols that have meaningful interpretations in the environment. But when the agent is intuitive, its behaviour is generated by a low-level program or physical device... 

The logical interpretation of dual process theories is that, when an agent is deliberative, its behaviour is generated by reasoning with high-level goals and beliefs. When the agent is intuitive, its behaviour is determined by low-level input–output associations, even if these associations can also be represented in logical form.
</blockquote>



It's also a friendly introduction to more recent logics. Perhaps too friendly - if you think that formal symbols always make things harder to think about, I recommend comparing learning logic from this vs a good semiformal text like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1638937.Logic">Tomassi</a>. The bloat of English compared to symbols is about 20x, and the overheads are impossible to miss.

It is at least what I hoped it would be: a very clear introduction to good old "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence">GOFAI</a>" in all its rigour, grandiosity and narrowness. (There are maybe 600 definitions in this.)  I wanted a logician's (or logic programmer's) view on AI, and I got it (from the technical appendices). CL is impressive and authoritative on a small number of tasks, but it's just not generally promising, and hasn't been for a long time. This 2011 book read like a time capsule from the 1970s, before Prolog and Cyc had soured, before the Winter. (I should clarify that inductive logic programming <a href="https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11172">is a live research programme</a> - I'm going to work on it myself - but only in combination with the ruling statistical methods.) I actually don't understand how he can think that this approach is the answer - is it unkind to put it down to decades of sunk cost?

I also thought it might be a more rigorous version of Algorithms to Live By, and I suppose it is, but at the cost of its practicality.

Umberto Eco (2012)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2014<br>
<br>
Calm, panoptic and ennobling. (Funniest clause all month: “thus Lenin was a neo-Thomist – without of course realising it.”) 

There’s good sad Realism under his playful semiotic historicism: only lazy academic cliques prevent people seeing that the critical realist & the pomo skylark can coexist. So it’s a surprise but not a shock to see him use basically Johnson’s defence against relativism. 

Eco chides the Church with its own history! The title essay is composed of quotations from virulent historical racists / misogynists / puritans: it's hard to read. 

He walks the difficult line between being maximally clear & slightly banal (thus he says things like “Fire is a metaphor for many impulses…”, but also:

<blockquote>Trying to understand other people means destroying the stereotype without denying or ignoring the otherness.</blockquote>

Jackie Kay (1991)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2014<br>
<br>
Strong, po-faced verse portrait of her own birth and adoption, in three voices. Really lovely details throughout – her mother hiding all her Communist décor for first meeting the birth mother; Kay kissing her poster of Angela Davis goodnight, a traumatic, funny dismissal of the idea that your real mother has to be your birth mother

<blockquote>(“After mammy telt me she wisna my real mammy I wis scared to death she wis gonna melt…”).</blockquote>

 

Meeting her bio-mum much later, Kay’s disillusionment is subtly and truly done: “the blood does not bind confusion” (mop it up, like carbon dioxide). It becomes apparent that Kay has just created the birth mother character – her mouth filled with vivid Plathian violence and articulate confusion not born out by the real woman. If so, more the better.

Gleeful and rarely zany. I don’t laugh at books much, but snorted all the way through this on a long megabus. The middle section on class and gender is light and uncliched and makes her fall from grace <a href="http://bitchmagazine.org/post/why-i-didnt-run-the-caitlin-moran-interview">among pious people</a> all the sadder. We need people who can talk about these things without sounding like an appalling prig.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60581087)">"The Passenger (The Passenger #1)"</a></h3>

Cormac McCarthy (2022)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jun 2023<br>
<br>
One of the nicest things about McCarthy novels is incongruous intelligence, the pastoral philosophising of his horse handlers and nomads and illiterate orphans. That's all over now: here we have instead the children of Los Alamos, heirs to the biggest brains in the world. And they make a giant mess of themselves despite it.

<blockquote>At age twelve she had a picture of Frank Ramsey in a dimestore frame standing on her bedside table. She wanted to know if you could be in love with someone who was dead</blockquote>


(In CM's quote-mark-free dialogue they speak in much the same terse wise colloquial slang as e.g. John Grady Cole, a very different man. And we still get some lovely incongruity, with e.g. Western's mental maths on the river-dredging job.)

This book is even less hopeful and even less redeemed than CM's previous dark-lantern novels. The plot is nonlinear because the order *doesn't matter*. Nothing changes in the protagonist between '63 and '80. Western is taciturn and brilliant and charming and traumatised and oblique, like many a Cormac leading man. But he does not develop. He has been child prodigy, Caltech grad student, formula two driver, and found a million dollars, awed his colleagues. It doesn't matter. He is stuck. 

Western is a haunted man, mostly outwardly indifferent to the terrible offscreen forces that take *most* of what he values but somehow leave him his life. (Who is the passenger? Who kills Oiler? Who steals the papers? Who burns the cabin? Who is the second ransacker? Why not the grandmother? Why not him? The car? You, reader, don't deserve to know.)

His will is not broken, he just turned it off. Maximum loss, no more losses can register. The forces of the world are not known to you and you cannot beat them. An old man's creed.

Rather than trace an arc for one character, like you want him to, CM wants to talk about ideas explicitly for a change (chiefly, miserable post-theistic gnosticism, physics and the human capacity to know anything). But he also doesn't want to argue with you and doesn't want to accumulate ideas into a thesis. That would be dishonestly Panglossian. That's a young man's game.

<blockquote>You will never know what the world is made of. The only thing that’s certain is that it’s not made of the world

If I could do physics, I would. No matter what.</blockquote>




It's a wordcel's lament: the sort of song you sing on realising what it takes to get to heaven while also realising that you are not in that elect. James Wood teases CM, sarcastically misquoting him "To traffic in serious mathematics is to commune with truth; to traffic in words, to merely write novels, is to produce dim approximations of the truth. This is what too many colloquies at the Santa Fe Institute will do to a novelist’s self-esteem." But CM is right and so it is magnanimous of him to attempt (fail) to capture the style of thought which succeeds in hooking onto very general structures of reality. To try and show the people who get over themselves. Wood cannot imagine that words could be so weak.

<blockquote>		By the time he left for Caltech in the fall he’d changed his major from math to physics. The reasons he gave in his letter were the best he could come up with but they werent the reason. The reason was that in talking to her on those warm nights at his grandmother’s kitchen table he had seen briefly into the deep heart of number and he knew that world would be forever closed to him.

* Wood also teases him for writing flawless characters - attractive, witty, competent, rich geniuses - but this too misses the point. They have every advantage and every virtue and they still destroy themselves, still cannot make life meaningful.

* As before, CM skips the apostrophe in "don't", etc. This is just to denote the very-weak-forms of Southern US. But it doesn't mean the class connotation it leaves us. 

* I say that he failed to explain how a physicist or a mathematician's mind works. Well obviously he does, but his actual sin is to reproduce the shallow trappings of genius rather than the actual process.

<blockquote>a lot of his friends had Nobel Prizes but he wasnt going to get one.

* Western alludes to the one great thing he did wrong. It's the opposite of what you think.

* All-time great rant:

It’s painful but still I suppose one has to extend a certain latitude to the little dears. They’ve so little time in which to parlay that pussy into something of substance. But it nettles. That you knucklewalkers should even be allowed to contemplate the sacred grotto as you drool and grunt and wank. Let alone actually reproduce. Well the hell with it. A pox upon you.

* The Manhattan Project is oddly underused as a theme, but we get one wonderful image, of the women machine operators who haven't been briefed, watching the dark magic of the centrifuges:

* The end starts to take the "missionaries" (men in black, government overreach) seriously, with good paranoid talk about electronic paper trails for all transactions and how to go off-grid.

Still, it isn't nasty, just maximally pessimistic, darker than any merely nasty book. It is not fair that CM can get away with unclear plot and unclear philosophy and a failed depiction of mathematical genius, and still have a good book riding on his prose alone. But who's looking for fair.

<blockquote>
to be female is an older thing even than to be human

I said: Mama, it’s William. And she knelt there for a minute in the dirt and then she put her hand over her mouth and these big tears started to roll down her cheeks. She just knelt there. Shaking her head back and forth. As if she’d been told that someone had died. Well, I suppose someone had.

Beauty makes promises that beauty cant keep

Minus one for the Kid hallucination passages, which are supposed to be absurd and Brechtian but which are just annoying.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75665931)">"The MANIAC"</a></h3>

Benjamín Labatut (2023)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2024<br>
<br>
<blockquote>I’m thinking about something much more important than bombs, my dear. I’m thinking about computers... I remember him there, standing silent within the computation, staring at the lights flashing in front of his eyes. One machine thinking inside of another... He left us a part of his mind.</blockquote>





Elevated by its choice of subject: the continuity between nuclear weapons, computers, and AI; the resulting threat to all things; the psychology that led people to produce them. This is the most important thing to talk about. And vN is still underrated and understudied -- equivalent in productivity to a thousand scientists, more ("the creative outpouring of some minor god toying with the world... he did not comprehend the insecurities that haunt the rest of us; he understood nothing of uncertainty, awkwardness, or lack of self-worth since he was always so much better, so much smarter than anyone else"). 


But Labatut is not technical enough to really pull it off and he opts for melodrama to make you care. (His choice of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1bX3F7uTrg">Adam Curtis</a> epigram is revealing.) Obviously he can't put the technialities on the page, but he's not technical enough behind the scenes and trying too hard to be emotive. 


Portions of the text are verbatim disquotations (see e.g. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6564963-i-returned-to-civilization-shortly-after-that-and-went-to">Feynman</a>). But the rest of it, the connective tissue he adds, words in their mouth, is only imperfectly simulated. Chiefly melodrama.


The great challenge of science writing is managing to convey any real structure to the nontechnical reader. Labatut does not ever hop this high bar, the great wall between you and the real thing. Instead we have only consequences, black boxes. You will forever miss most of von Neumann unless you look at a <a href="https://archive.org/details/mathematicalfoun0613vonn/page/n7/mode/2up">single page</a> of his actual work.


He is way too fond of the "irrational rationality" meme - that you can be too rational, that rationality is inhuman. This comes from 1) an artist's love of cheap paradox; 2) an impoverishment conception of rationality as mere explicit intellection (rather than wisdom, integration, all-things-considered utility). He opts for the same pat shit that Turing's champions so often do:

<blockquote>He felt lonely even among the people he loved. Because of that, I could understand the strange kinship he felt toward computers</blockquote>




L suggests that vN was ~psychopathic until the H-bomb test - a Maniac. When he started to take responsibility for the world, for his giant effects on it. It's simpler to say that he was an (excessively) high decoupler who bet on American supremacy and took gigantic instrumental risks to ensure it.

<blockquote>His mind was in a state of constant hunger... Spiritually, he was an ignoramus, yes, but he did have unquestionable faith in logic. Ah, but that type of faith is always dangerous! Especially if it is later betrayed. Nothing should be beyond question... Lost faith is worse than no faith at all, because it leaves behind a gaping hole... once he abandoned his juvenile faith in mathematics he became more practical and effective than before, but also dangerous. He was, in a very real sense, set free...


it was actually von Neumann who convinced them that they shouldn’t detonate the devices at ground level, but higher up in the atmosphere, since that way the blast wave would cause incomparably larger damage. He even calculated the optimal height himself — six hundred meters, about two thousand feet. And that is exactly how high our bombs were when they exploded above the roofs of those quaint wooden houses in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.


Many people still believe that Mutually Assured Destruction helped prevent the Cold War from turning hot</blockquote>




I asked him, point-blank, why he felt that he needed to stay in Europe and to travel so often to Germany. He was so close, he said, so close to the foundations of mathematics that he could feel a tingle in his brain! That month, the Nazis had become the second-strongest political force in Germany, and Jancsi’s wife, Mariette, kept nagging me to convince him to stop traveling there, to stay with her in Hungary. It was pointless, really, we both knew how stubborn he was, so I did not even try... Jancsi was obsessed with history—especially with the fall of ancient empires—and though his hatred for the Nazis was essentially boundless, he was also convinced that he would know exactly when to leave. I now shudder at the accuracy of some of his prognoses, prophecies that no doubt came from his incredible capacity to process information and to sift the sand of the present through the currents of history. That gave him a certain sense of security, an overconfidence that would no doubt have betrayed a lesser man. </blockquote>




It is, though, fine and correct to describe him as <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/2019/10/26/some-notes-on-von-neumann-as-a-human-being/">a fool</a>. Labatut depicts the Mitteleuropean bourgeois as looking down on his love of America and toys and gambling and fooling around - no doubt accurately - but this reflects more on them than him. What I take from Klari is that it is all the more impressive that Von Neumann wasn't miserable and a snob. (Einstein too.)

<blockquote>He once spent half an hour explaining the many advantages of having a small Pekinese versus a Great Dane, and he was still going on about it when I got up and left. This, from the same person who made countless contributions to group, ergodic, and operator theory, and published thirty-two major papers in less than three years


America altered something inside him, it triggered a chemical or electrical rewiring of his brain... Not a breath of culture to be found in that entire country.


peeking underneath the desks of the secretaries at the institute. Some of those poor women had to stick pieces of cardboard there, just so that this great man, this Übermensch, would stop staring up their skirts</blockquote>

* I liked the notes in passing about von Neumann's appropriation of other people's ideas, though he misses the biggest examples (like vN unilaterally releasing The computer design - including huge amounts of other people's work - into the public domain and profiting off ENIAC at IBM). The only place that Labatut manages to outdo <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4272025298">Bhattacharya</a> is the discussion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Aall_Barricelli">Barricelli</a>, the actual father of genetic algorithms. ("Neither acknowledged each other’s work. Not a word in their writings. I’ve checked. It’s as if they never met.")


* "it later turned out that his attempt [to axiomatise set theory] was also unsuccessful". As written, this is false. Labatut means that it didn't offer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_second_problem">completeness</a>, but the theory is successful on a different great goal.


* "Janos and Gödel. Even in death, they are still connected, buried in the same cemetery, a few feet apart from each other." 


* Labatut lets Morgenstern give himself more credit than he deserves, but also includes Klari: "the parasites that rode my husband’s coattails and fed off his brilliance like those tiny wasps that drill into the cores of regal oaks. Morgenstern, for example".


* "Heisenberg [intentionally] stalled [the nazi nuclear weapons programme], apparently, but we didn’t know that at the time" - classic <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2443328088">falsehood</a>.


* It is very striking to see Labatut try to talk about <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/">the Martians</a> without mentioning Jewishness (14 out of 18 of them were Jewish). "how could such a little country—surrounded as it was by enemies on all sides and torn between rival empires—produce so many extraordinary scientists in so little time... a pressure on the <b>whole society</b> of that part of Central Europe"


* "von Neumann, and he was awful at [chess]" (compared to Feynman).


* It is irrational to misuse of game theory, to overlook all the violated assumptions. But this is no strike against the theory. "if you looked at it logically using the models of game theory, he said, a nuclear first strike was not just the optimal solution". This was one of the worst errors of all time, but he repudiated it within months of loudly proclaiming it.


* The MANIAC computer foregrounded here isn't very prominent in the history of the first computers. "Our computer wasn’t the first. Wasn’t even the third. But it was a stored-program computer." So were Baby and modified-ENIAC, earlier.


* "mushroom-shaped cloud that rose toward the stratosphere and continued to grow until it was five times taller than Mount Everest"


* "in modern biology we have this very peculiar situation: its most fundamental and precise mathematical basis was established first, and then we found out how life on Earth had actually gone about implementing it. That’s not the way things go. In science, you normally start from the concrete and then move to the abstract, while here von Neumann laid out the rules, with our DNA being just one particular example of them. So if you were writing a history of ideas, you could definitely say that Watson and Crick’s description of the function of DNA was prefigured by von Neumann, because he had explained it nearly a decade earlier"


* Haha biologists get owned: "in biology, I became truly worried about what he could do. Unlike mathematics or physics, that entire realm of science was still untouched by logic". (She means literal formal logic I think)


* "qwvickly, qwvestion, twvaining, or — his trademark — integhers, mistakes that were so common in his speech that I came to believe that he made them on purpose, since he was always perfectly articulate in all the other languages he spoke"


* Sorry to say that Klári sounds exhausting.


* von Neumann's terror on his deathbed is sad, undignified. Converting to Catholicism, drunkenly strapping on tefillin, losing everything. But then he was losing more than I'll lose

<blockquote>He suffered from the loss of his mind more than I have seen any human being suffer, in any other circumstance</blockquote>




* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLbllFHBQM4">The only video we have of him.</a>


* I have never heard of the bizarre lethal electrical cure for cancer Labatut suggests vN died from: "his skin had turned black, with dime-sized white spots all over it, as if they had covered his body in electrodes and burned him to a crisp... closed casket".

On the other hand, Boltzmann and Ehrenfest are perfect for Labatut's style because they actually were tragic and melodramatic men.

<blockquote>the slow and constant advance of his mental disorder, which seemed, like the entropy of the universe he had so wonderfully captured in [Boltzmann's] equation, to be constantly and irreversibly increasing, leading to inevitable randomness and decay. He admitted to his colleagues that he lived in perpetual fear that he might suddenly lose his mind during a lecture. Toward the end of his life he could hardly breathe from his asthma, his eyesight dimmed to the point where he could no longer read, and his headaches and migraines became so utterly unbearable that his physician ordered him to completely abstain from any scientific activity.

Ehrenfest was oddly vulnerable to the classic layman's reaction to the crisis of foundations: to clutch pearls and go full Pythogoras in the face of inconvenience and surprise:

<blockquote>To acknowledge even the possibility of the irrational, to recognize disharmony, would place the fabric of existence at risk, since not just our reality, but every single aspect of the universe — whether physical, mental, or ethereal — depended on the unseen threads that bind all things together... it would be a death blow to science, philosophy, and rationality</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Ehrenfest] knew of no way to keep [his son] safe from the strange new rationality that was beginning to take shape all around them, a profoundly inhuman form of intelligence that was completely indifferent to mankind’s deepest needs; this deranged reason, this specter haunting the soul of science... Paul sensed its budding influence, could hear the faint stirring of its tendrils as it slowly crawled toward us, and yet he could not name or place it, and hardly dared to speak of it out loud, for how could he tell if this morbid imagining, this inexplicable bane that he felt it was his duty to arrest, was the fruit of genuine foresight, or just another malignant growth of the delusion that was slowly overcoming his mind</blockquote>




Naziism was famously irrational. Naive noncooperative game theory didn't exist yet so that can't be the culprit. Industrialism / economism / extractivism isn't really relevant here. So that leaves some supposed premonition of Godel -> Turing -> AI. The <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundational_crisis_of_mathematics">foundational crisis</a> is in fact causally linked to a dire existential risk, but Labatut's mouthpiece for it doesn't satisfy me. Ehrenfest was obviously the irrational one!

The climactic AI chapter is not successful. ("Its name is AlphaZero". dan-dan-DAAAAN.) RL is the wrong lineage to worry about, and no leading approach uses genetic algorithms much, nor the theory of self-replicators. So the entire thematic development of the preceding 2 chapters fails - he works up to AlphaGo via artificial life and mathematical DNA mechanisms, a total red herring for current AI and current existential risks.


But again this is the red thread of our time and maybe all time. That he picks Go, RL - the other, less portentous branch - is a minor peccadillo given he is looking in the right direction with the right gravitas. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passenger_(McCarthy_novel)">Most</a> novelists would not have made the leap, satisfied with the well-worn and fully sufficient dramaturgy of nuclear physics. Maybe more will now as AI becomes visible to the naked eye, requiring no imagination to contend with.

Benvenuto Cellini (1999)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2023<br>
<br>
Italian Psycho.

<blockquote>When I saw the court coming to certain decisions about my case, passed on to me by those lawyers, seeing there was no other way to help myself I had recourse to my large dagger... That night I stabbed him so many times in the legs and arms (taking care, however, not to kill him) that I deprived him of the use of both his legs. Then I went after the fellow who had brought the suit, and notched him so effectively that he abandoned it...

Since I’m a man I’ve used her for enjoyment in bed, and it could be that she will give me a child. I don’t want to bear the expense of other men’s children. If anything happened I’d have her and her mother hanged, along with any [man] who did such a thing...

the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_I_of_France">King</a> left much sooner than he would have done, saying in a loud voice, to encourage me, that he had brought from Italy the greatest artist ever born. 

the Pope raised his hand, carefully made a great sign of the cross above my head, and said that he gave me his blessing and that he forgave me all the homicides I had ever committed</blockquote>



Soldier, goldsmith, sculptor, memoirist, cornettist, siege engineer, gunsmith?, master of the Vatican mint, master of coin for the French state, <a href="https://www.papalartifacts.com/portfolio-item/pope-pius-x-a-papal-mace-used-in-ceremonies-at-the-vatican/">mace-bearer</a>, rake, serial murderer, bi icon, monk. An exhausting man, driven frantic with creativity, cupidity, violence, sex, pettiness, climbing, and phony Renaissance "honour" (viciousness). He lies, but the remarkable thing is how few of the mad things he says are lies and how honest he is about his crimes. (Contrary to Samuel Pepys, who did not mean to be publicly honest.) He is much more violent even than this violent book admits (he openly passes over some duels, and he lies several times about just spooking someone with a knife when actually it was gbh mayhem).

* He kills a dozen people, not counting dozens more French soldiers
* He is arrested about 10 times
* He escapes from prison 2 times
* He is charged with sodomy 3 times
* A mob takes up arms against him many times, more than 10.
* He gets severely ill (months in bed) with plague or fever or poison about 6 times

We have court records of some of this, so we're in the odd position of admitting that he had a wild and stranger-than-fictional life - while doubting every word of the causes and justification given for the crimes. (Funny: his brother is exiled "for six months at a distance of ten miles from Florence". Restraining order.)

Such men are wonderful to read about, hell itself to live with. But the book is as boring as the confessions of a serial killer and great artist can be: he lists every little coin and vase he ever designed and constantly seethes about people who didn't pay him 10 crowns 40 years ago. Apparently this makes it one of the key historical documents of the time ("the most vivid and convincing account we have of the rulers of the sixteenth century and of the manners and morals of their subjects. Cellini’s friends and enemies were drawn from every level of society: we are introduced, in rapid succession, to inn-keepers and prostitutes, merchants and soldiers, musicians and writers, cardinals and dukes")


The most dishonest thing about him is the complete omission of any errors on his part. This absurd constraint requires him to impose a parable structure on every anecdote. (He always sees the problem coming, he always explicitly tells the wrongdoer not to do it or else, then his extraordinary brutality is just the honourable thing to do.)

<blockquote>1538: Cellini notices that a halo remains around his head in consequence of his visions

Friend, to BC: 'All the years I’ve known you I’ve never seen you start a quarrel in the wrong.’</blockquote>


Here's the one counterexample (which admits only going a bit over the top in forcing the victim to marry and then screwing and beating his new wife over and over):

<blockquote>	If when describing these events I did not admit that I know I was sometimes acting wrongly, it would not ring true when I treat of actions which I know were justified. I know I made a mistake in wanting such an extreme revenge on Pagolo Miccieri</blockquote>


I think this is the first time I've heard a criminal openly say they were only deterred by the threat of punishment: "I had in the meantime made up my mind that the best thing would be to throw them both out of the house, seeing that if I killed them on top of all my other recent actions I would have difficulty escaping with my own life."

We can tell his evils are calculated rather than blind madness, because he never shows any anger at all to his betters (cardinals and up). He correctly notes the huge licence that Renaissance Italy gave its artists (e.g. they were imprisoned in the same jail as nobles) and milks it for dozens of pardons and blind eyes. 

The surprising thing after all of this is that he was indeed <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/img/r/p/500x600/12809.jpg?v=1645698602">a great</a> <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cellini_-_Crucifix_%28detail%29,_03marble.jpg">artist</a>, and anomalously prolific despite the extreme turmoil he created. He really does care about art, and not just as a route to wealth and status (though he never ever talks like a sensitive artist of our ken).

<blockquote>I have always taken delight in witnessing and growing familiar with every kind of expertise</blockquote>

 He manages a crew of a dozen technicians well, apparently mostly not with terror and threats.

<blockquote>I rode at her side upon a pretty little horse of mine, making signs to my servant that he should keep somewhat apart, which gave us the opportunity of discussing things that are not sold by the apothecary.</blockquote>

 (Condoms? Abortifacients?)

<blockquote>accusing him of using her “in the Italian fashion, that is to say, unnaturally like a sodomite... To this I answered that such was not the Italian way, and that on the contrary it must be the French way, since she knew all about it and not I</blockquote>


(He denies sodomy. But his omnisexuality is obvious.)

<blockquote>he was about fourteen; he was the son of a Roman citizen who lived on a private income. This Paulino had the most perfect manners, the most honest character, and the prettiest face of any I have ever come across in all my life. His honest way of behaving and his incredible beauty and the great love he showed me made me love him in turn almost more than I could bear... Whenever I took up the cornet such a frank, beautiful smile came over his face that I am not at all surprised at those silly stories the Greeks wrote about their gods. In fact if Paulino had been alive in those days he might have unhinged them even more.

a little maid of about thirteen or fourteen... I had the little maid, who was as fresh as fresh

our admirable president decided that the following Sunday we would all meet for supper at his house, and each of us was to bring what Michelagnolo called his crow [mistress] along with him. Whoever failed to do so would have to stand all the others a supper... I hit on a trick that would amuse everyone enormously... a young lad of sixteen who lived next door... a handsome boy, with a wonderful complexion, and his head was even more beautifully modelled than that of the ancient statue of Antinous... When he came in I asked him to let me dress him up in the woman’s clothes I had got ready. He was quite willing and put them on at once... After that I arranged some beautiful gold and richly jewelled necklaces round his neck, and adorned his lovely hands with rings... Michelagnolo stood up and said that one kissed the feet of the Pope but the cheeks of angels – and when he suited the action to the words the young man blushed furiously and looked more beautiful than ever. After this introduction, we discovered that the room was full of sonnets that we had written and sent to Michelagnolo. My young companion began to read them, and as he spoke them aloud – every one of them – his incredible beauty was so enhanced that I find it impossible to describe... in their concern for her, the two women started feeling Pomona’s body and discovered she was a male. They drew their hands away quickly, shot up from the table, and began insulting him, in words usually reserved for pretty young men. Immediately uproar broke out, and everyone started laughing and crying out in amazement. The stern Michelagnolo asked permission to give me the penance he thought proper and, when it was granted, with loud cries from everyone else he lifted me up and shouted: ‘Long live Benvenuto: long live Benvenuto.’

Despite starting at the bottom he is rarely an apprentice, instead a free contractor. One would have thought that the guild would stamp this out, but he never mentions a guild. Early on he loses a third of his takings to the workshop he rents, but that's it. Maybe he just ignored them and they rightly stayed clear of the psycho.

At one point, manning a cannon, he nearly kills a cardinal by accident. His response is typical: threaten anyone who reprimands him with cannonfire.

<blockquote>I trained two light cannon on the stairway, determined that whoever came up first would get the full force of one of them. "You useless fools – if you don’t clear off, if one of you dares climb up these stairs, I have two falconets ready and I’ll blow you to smithereens"</blockquote>



Later,

<blockquote>We all fired, twice in succession, and I looked cautiously over the wall. The enemy had been thrown into the most extraordinary confusion, because one of our shots had killed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III,_Duke_of_Bourbon">Bourbon</a>... 		being perhaps more attracted to soldiering than to my real profession, and as a result I made a better job of it than I did of being a goldsmith... my shot struck the sword and cut him in two. The Pope who was taken by surprise was astonished and delighted... I was the man who let fire at Iscatinaro, for talking disrespectfully to the Pope, with brutal insolence, like the Lutheran and infidel that he was. When this happened Pope Clement had the castle searched, to discover and hang the man who did it...


...the French pox. In Rome, as it happens, this particular disease is very fond of priests – especially very rich priests</blockquote>



He invokes God frequently, but is happy to go larping black magic:

<blockquote>We went together to the Coliseum; and there the priest, having arrayed himself in necromancer’s robes, began to describe circles on the earth with the finest ceremonies that can be imagined. I must say that he had made us bring precious perfumes and fire, and also drugs of fetid odour... then he began his incantations. This lasted more than an hour and a half; when several legions appeared, and the Coliseum was all full of devils... he prayed me to stand firm by him, because the legions were a thousandfold more than he had summoned, and were the most dangerous of all the denizens of hell... I looked at Agnolino Gaddi, whose eyes were starting from their sockets in his terror, and who was more than half dead... hearing me laugh, he plucked up courage, and said the devils were taking to flight tempestuously.

Keep <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Benvenuto_Cellini">this</a> open as you read; without images it's too easy to just laugh when people keep on talking about how e.g. his "salt-cellar" is a masterpiece, the most beautiful thing possible outside of paradise, etc.

If even three-quarters of this was false, we would still have to change our minds about how much a life can contain, how realistic the old epics and picaresques are.

Casually brilliant and oddly fond history of the UN et al. 

Practical cosmopolitanism - the promotion of any supranational structure at all - was for a long long time a view held only by strange people indeed - visionaries and ranters and scifi writers - until it was suddenly in the works, laboured over by full secretariats with big bucks. 

Mazower puzzles over why the US and Britain put so much into these structures, when the previous world order suited them fine. Answer? "Camouflage."

Toty brace of magazine pieces in which he philosophises bare-knuckle fights, juggling, and yes petty hatred. He’s cute, what with his italicised phrases that are now clichés (“blue ruin”), his enthusiasm for enthusiasm, his mid-sentence verse quotations, his Latinate insults (“O procul, este profani”), and enthusiastic woe. is reaction to seeing someone juggle four balls at once:

<blockquote>It makes me ashamed of myself. I ask what there is I can do as well as this? Nothing. What have I been doing all my life? … What abortions are these Essays! How little is made out, and that little how ill! Yet they are the best I can do.</blockquote>


The essay that’s from is about juggling and the concept Greatness and the character of a dear dead sportsman friend – and all this in 20 pages. Big man, only sometimes clotted in the seven-clause sentences of his age.

<br>
Despite Kelman's aggressive parochialism, this is worth reading for people outside Glasgow. Sammy's blindness makes me notice prose per se. You yourself are seeing just as much as you always see when you read Kelman on Sammy not seeing what he had seen: the print. You notice that you are always blind to a novel's world. But you, or Kelman, produce a rich darkness out of these marks quite unlike that of a sighted character. The confusing patter (or your other social distance from Sammy) is another kind of difficulty seeing.

At the time, the book was very controversial - one judge stormed out, one Times goon accused Kelman of "acting the part of an illiterate savage" (and is usually misquoted missing the first bit of that, for political ends). These days Kelman likening the Scottish condition to the black Brit condition would go similarly.

I am <a href="https://www.gleech.org/disco">roundly</a> obsessed with the game but this was only partially successful and would not stand on its own without the shining emotional association to carry me through. But the funhouse mirror of tragic europe, tragic eurocommunism, the metaphysicalisation of his own political disappointments, the sheer grandeur of misery, is all his.

The prison interview scene is, however, one of the most viscerally unsettling pieces of prose I have ever seen, so there's that achievement.

On revolution from below, in the brief instants before betrayal and internal tyranny:

<blockquote>Good people from all over the world came together. Teachers, writers, and migrant workers huddle in trenches… young soldiers desert their units. What beautiful songs they sing! Brave children are history’s favourites, so it seems to them, and they wave white flags with silver horned crowns. And they lose. Coups are crushed. Anarchists are piled into mass graves on the Great Blue. Communists, beaten back from the isola of Graad, retreat to Samara and become a degenerate worker’s state ruled by bureaucrats…

“The bravest of the kojkos. A movie star, a revolutionary. It was just recently that the riots were brutally suppressed in the spring, and now nothing has been heard of him for two months. It is said that he lurks far away in the taiga, in the Yakut reserve, and acquires special abilities from the indigenous priests. Fantastic things… “But the months pass and no news comes, and soon it’s autumn. Industrial dust falls like a mourning veil on the golden and red leaves. In October, a completely different story begins to circulate in Zsiemsk. Quiet and timid. Frantiček the Brave was shot behind a dumpster…

<br>
Casts an atmosphere of desperation and doom from the very first pages and rarely lets it up except to ironically foreshadow renewed dread or to show off the sheer manful stoicism of his men.

<blockquote>Rats, as Crozier knows from the sad experience of thirteen winters in the ice, tend to eat one’s friends quietly and efficiently, except for their frequent screeching as the blood-maddened and ravenous vermin turn on one another

In this cold, teeth can shatter after two or three hours — actually explode — sending shrapnel of bone and enamel flying inside the cavern of one’s clenched jaws. Sometimes, Crozier knows from experience, you can hear the enamel cracking just before the teeth explode. 

“I explained to Sir James over tea,” Jane was saying, “that my darling Sir John’s credit and reputation are infinitely dearer to me than any selfish enjoyment of my husband’s society, even if he must be gone for four years”

One of Crozier’s legs was knocked aside and down as the bullet tore through the knee or the muscle just below the knee. The captain made no sound.</blockquote>



Naval culture is one of the most extreme and alien cultures, particularly among those which persisted way under 200 years ago. This book gives you the misery and extremity, but you need Patrick O’Brian for the glory and humour. Why were men proud to go on the ice ships for 4 years with a long line of lethal failures to follow.

Overall a triumph of style and stamina but I don’t actually admire literary stamina.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26218192)">"Floornight"</a></h3>

<br>
Leonard Cohen does Stanislaw Lem. Floornight is so blatantly steeped in Evangelion's free association and helplessness and internal paroxysms that I initially took it for an unflagged satire of it. (The LCL is NGE if you know what I mean.) But it's more than its sources. Simultaneously more playful and less <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/207g5j/what_exactly_is_wrong_with_evas_use_of_religious/">nonsensical</a> than them.

Among other things it's about two kinds of barbarism: superstitious primitivism and high-modern brutality. It is hard to empathise with the characters who blithely torment obviously sensitive and sentient people - it feels like a narrative trick to make such people. But our factory farms are the obvious current counterpoint.

One way in which it surpasses almost all science fiction is the attempt to make the new physics consistent and to write technical characters who actually approach it as a technical problem, with unreliable data, excessively strong assumptions, projection of the true theory into a low dimensional effective theory for the benefit of the manager character and us. For once its technical jargon is not just sciencey adornment.

It is easy to misread. For instance, consider the holy poverty of the Iah cult triumphant, the fideist primitives who destroy the decadent technological society. Is their victory a political statement? Aficionados of the man know that the holy warrior children are instead inspired by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Henry+Darger">Henry Darger's</a> dark dreams.

One thing which does seem clear to me, on the other hand, is its critique of moral ambition / monomania. Martin is at various times either the creator or liberator of the dark city: his grandiosity and abstraction and will to power are equally suited to work great good or great evil. <spoiler>But I find Avatar Maria's diss of Martin's mere human consequentialism annoying, given what she immediately proceeds to do.</spoiler> 

One of the few web-serial tropes it would be better without is the daffy / abrupt making out. (But the book needs silly joy quite badly, so never mind.)

It's a very ambiguous ending, as in its forebears. <spoiler>A handful of people decide to give up for all of humanity and merge with the aliens / god. Hermetia, the most genre-savvy and panoptic character, spits that the aliens are "flat", <a href="https://www.gleech.org/anti-ethics">monist</a>, will destroy most value in the insatiable optimisation of one value (nonsuffering / nonseparation). But everyone goes happily into the grinder and the end is not morose.</spoiler>

Agatha tries her hand at Mrs Dalloway; a 'successful' busybody is forced to spend a few days alone with no distractions and slowly realises that she's a terrible person and is barely tolerated. Her trying to pray:

<blockquote>God - thank thee - poor Blanche - thank thee that I am not like that... Her own fault of course - dreadful - quite a shock - thank God - I am different.

'I know what I've become. Coarse in mind and body - that's what you were thinking. Well, there are worse things.'
Joan privately doubted very much whether there were.</blockquote>


Smugness, priggishness is an awful thing but you can carry them all the way through your adulthood because they are below the bar of crime, vice, or inhumanity and so people don't beat them out of you. 

I have problems with bohemians. ("It isn't that the aesthete is too serious about the artistic: he isn't serious enough about what gives rise to it." - Clive James.) But I'll take them over Joan's barren, paternal practicality and class-brained simulacra. The economic power and subcultures of the C20th made some space for us. Everyone knows there's more to life than careers and appearances. You don't hear a lot from Joan anymore, except in the letters page of the Mail.

<blockquote>'I have friends who have been in Germany a good deal, and they think that there is a lot to be said for the Nazi movement.'
</blockquote>



Nice portrait of the phenomenology of irrational thoughts, louping inference, travel as annealing, repulsive contemplation, secular revelation, and the iron grip of habit, home, easy self-deception. Notably, Joan is not vicious: she really loves her husband and her children. And yet.

<blockquote>Hadn't she enjoyed the idea of playing the part of the devoted mother? Hadn't she seen herself as a charming, impulsive woman being welcomed by her ill daughter and her distracted son-in-law?</blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7130670)">"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"</a></h3>

Raymond Carver (2009)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Nov 2019<br>
<br>
I'm surprised to find Carver relying on punchlines - last-line narrative puns - in most of these stories. There is: a lot of rambling, a lot of meanness (breakups, fights, conversations that would be much healthier if they were honest fights), and then a transcendent or transcendently degraded last line. It would almost be not worth reading if you lost all the last lines. Here's what I mean by a pun - from 'The Calm':

<blockquote>But today I was thinking of that place, of Crescent City, and of how I was trying out a new life there with my wife, and how, in the barber's chair that morning, I had made up my mind to go. I was thinking today about the calm I felt when I closed my eyes and let the barber's fingers move through my hair, the sweetness of those fingers, the hair already starting to grow.
</blockquote>

I expected him to care for his wretches.

The one from the wife's perspective, 'So Much Water So Close To Home' is the only standout. Completely menacing with almost no action, no flash. Good portraits of the oafish, as opposed to the rapey, as opposed to the long-suffering. I can't decide if the last line is acquiescence or perversity.

The title story is surprisingly slight, a 16-page Symposium with oddly inarticulate, repetitive drinkers. (One has ~10 years of college education, and but he's the most primitive.) You could put this down to naturalism and forget it entirely, but for its two great lines. (The story is, then, a fine thing for the protagonist of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanleaf/2015/01/04/how-birdman-betrays-raymond-carver-an-untold-story/#64e140ac742c">Birdman</a> to stage - self-defeating, opaque, not as deep as it wants.)

Stories like these live or die on dialogue, and there's neither enough heft or polish in their chat for me. I always get <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2426881729">Chandler</a> and Carver mixed up (yeah, I know) - but if I didn't, I'd go for Chandler every time. The lowness of Chandler is Gothic, stylised, and somehow less general.

Plus one star for SMWSCTH.

He argues that capitalism was a necessary condition for the emancipation of gay people, since its associated urbanisation, weakening of family ties, mass anonymity, and the autonomy of wages(!) let gay people explore, gather, and build a movement, the first time since antiquity. 

Maybe this doesn't sound so wild to you, but as a 20yo Marxist this lifted the top right off my head.

Managed to unnerve me despite the extreme domesticity.

The big problem with stories about haunted houses is why anyone would ever stay in them after the first bad night. The stories require a stupefied lack of agency to get through their second acts. So too here, but it isn't very irksome. The other big problem is the lack of empirical spirit from the protagonists - can we finish philosophy of mind by enlisting the ghosts? There's a little bit of that here, but mostly just the old emotional haunting.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530)">"Annihilation (Southern Reach, #1)"</a></h3>

Jeff VanderMeer (2014)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jan 2021<br>
<br>
Very grim, sickly, but also very likeable. It succeeds at several rare things: depicting a scientist protagonist actually thinking in extremis; depicting an alien ecosystem, a thing with its own thing going on, misaligned with us but not hateful or a mere inversion of human value; relatedly, noticing the great horror story that is an ordinary ecosystem; depicting the common, vital, neglected fact that being really interested in something can systematically outweigh your fear, insecurity, hatred, love.

<blockquote>
I could easily lose hours there, observing the hidden life of tidal pools, and sometimes I marveled at the fact that I had been given such a gift: not just to lose myself in the present moment so utterly but also to have such solitude, which was all I had ever craved during my studies, my practice to reach this point.
</blockquote>



The prose is refined, sometimes faintly echoing Cormac McCarthy:

<blockquote>
This water was so dark we could see our faces in it, and it never stirred, set like glass, reflecting the beards of gray moss that smothered the cypress trees. If you looked out through these areas, toward the ocean, all you saw was the black water, the gray of the cypress trunks, and the constant, motionless rain of moss flowing down. All you heard was the low moaning. The effect of this cannot be understood without being there. The beauty of it cannot be understood, either, and when you see beauty in desolation it changes something inside you. Desolation tries to colonize you.” 
</blockquote>



The creatures / mind of Area X are scary, but not in a jump scare or serial killer way. They're just different. There's horror in nature, and the best PR team ever (Wordsworth, Muir, Attenborough) can't fully disguise this from you. Vast endless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichneumonidae#Reproduction_and_diet">torture</a> is part of its horror, but the rest is just difference and inevitability and scale. VanderMeer ties the spooky weirdness of Area X to the opacity and inhumanity of nature:

<blockquote>
the longer I stared at it, the less comprehensible the creature became. The more it became something alien to me, the more I had a sense that I knew nothing at all — about nature, about ecosystems. There was something about my mood and its dark glow that eclipsed sense, that made me see this creature, which had indeed been assigned a place in the taxonomy--catalogued, studied, and described--irreducible down to any of that. And if I kept looking, I knew that ultimately I would have to admit I knew less than nothing about myself as well, whether that was a lie or the truth.
</blockquote>



For a cosmic horror book, the biologist manages to avoid mysterianism amongst deep mysteries. VanderMeer keeps her thinking even in the face of her senses failing:

<blockquote>
I am aware that all of this speculation is incomplete, inexact, inaccurate, useless. If I don’t have real answers, it is because we still don’t know what questions to ask. Our instruments are useless, our methodology broken, our motivations selfish.
</blockquote>


You need to be comfortable with unresolved tension and inexplicable mythos and jarring shifts in tone and meaning. You need to be comfortable seeing the whole thing from a strange view, "the biologist's". People call her antisocial and autistic, but really she's just completely internally motivated: she cannot give a fuck, she will not make herself likeable, will not spill her guts for you. Like this book. 

Maybe 4/5 if I keep thinking about it later.

Great fun but not more. I admire their commitment to the bit: there are 6 pages of authentically cracked Victorian ads in the back of each issue, everyone's having a great time being haughty and obsequious in the letters page...

Moore is a master of flimflam and persiflage, of words like "flimflam" and "persiflage" and sentences like

<blockquote>
If man ye be and not some craven dog of Flanders, then G..'s name do not miss our profuse climax!

The key to seeming Victorian is hauteur and censoriousness, especially on race and sex, and it takes nerve to do that now, as Moore does.

Li Zhisui (1996)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Feb 2023<br>
<br>


* 500 pages: interminable list of different named cadres looking embarrassed, scared, or nonplussed, with no characterisation or distinguishing marks given. (There's a glossary, use it.)

* 200 pages: the exact change in volume of Mao's piss. Li hiding from Jiang in a militarised textile factory for 3 months, not seeing his family / sent to Jiangxi to do hard labour for a year.

* 63 pages: invaluable historical documentation of vice, ignorance, cowardice, brutality, and goofiness. The worst of the emperors, which is saying a lot.

<blockquote>Mao spent much of his time in bed or lounging by the side of a private pool, not dressing for days at a time. He... rinsed his mouth with tea [instead of brushing], and slept with <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/mao-s-girl-and-me/">country girls</a>... He did not bathe, preferring a rubdown with hot towels, although this made it hard for Dr. Li to stop the spread of venereal infections among his female companions... 
I cautioned him that herpes was contagious and could spread through sexual contact, but he ignored my warnings. He did not think the problem was so bad... The illness, transmitted by Mao, was a badge of honor, testimony to their close relations with the chairman... "a harem of three thousand concubines"... When I told Mao about the veneration being accorded his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango_cult">mango</a>, he laughed. He had no problem with the mango worship and seemed delighted by the story... He followed no schedule except on May Day and National Day and on the rare occasions when he received foreign visitors. Then he had to dress, taking barbiturates to control his anxiety.

[The "cultural work troupe"] provided entertainment not only for the Central Garrison Corps but also for Mao. The troupe contained a pool of young women, selected for their looks, their artistic talent, and their political reliability. Over time, the role of these dancing parties, and of some of the young women who participated in them, became too obvious for me to ignore.

[Mao's concubine] had become Mao’s gatekeeper... One day in June 1976, when Hua Guofeng had come to see Mao, Zhang Yufeng had been napping and the attendants on duty were afraid to rouse her. Two hours later, when Zhang had still not gotten up, Hua, second in command only to Mao, finally left without seeing his superior...
</blockquote>




There's enough of Li's own resentments and grudges and worry for his family to make it feel authentic.

<blockquote>In 1958–59, the food shortage hit, causing further hardship for my mother. Lillian still ate in the dining hall at Zhongnanhai, and I joined her when I was there. There was no meat[!]

...I devoted my professional life to Mao and China, but now I am stateless and homeless, unwelcome in my own country</blockquote>


His great-grandfather was physician to the Chinese emperor. He died just after publishing this.


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_Dehuai">Peng Dehuai</a> is one of the only people to come out of this looking good. Conversely, Deng mostly just keeps his mouth shut for 30 years, biding time.

What difference can really there be among "left" and "right" Maoists, who all agree that what Mao says is law? Left Maoism: "Socialist weeds are better than capitalist wheat".

<blockquote>Everyone was dressing like soldiers then, including Jiang Qing. </blockquote>



One odd thing: he keeps on insisting that the psychotic Jiang Qing was out to get him / to hurt Wang's faction by getting rid of him. But the factions are constantly mixing and she retains him as her physician. (Maybe just looking for an opportunity.)

<blockquote>Jiang Qing left Mao’s room triumphant and invited us to join her to celebrate with maotai, peanuts, and roast pork. “We are victorious,” she said, offering a toast. “Bottoms up. I will become a bludgeon, ready to strike.” It was an unpleasant experience, and I was very upset.</blockquote>


The original Maoists are a weird bunch, not at all simple thugs. Much of their evil was routed through passive aggression, perverting evidence, falsifying testimonies: a legalistic modus operandi. The foreword suggests that cowardice is the wrong way to interpret the silence and complicity of the top cadres: Mao was instead "relying on the Confucian unwillingness of those around him to confront their superior". An amusing ideological victory for the old patriarch.

I was also surprised by some of the lifespans involved. Wang lived to 99, and the great monster managed 84 despite chain-smoking, being riddled with VD, and antiquated medicine. 1974:

<blockquote>Shortly before midnight on September 8, 1976, the doctors had administered an intravenous injection of shengmai san, a traditional Chinese herbal concoction... during episodic emergencies we relied on the American-made respirator that Henry Kissinger had sent in 1971 after his secret mission to China... I touched the gums lightly and some pus oozed out. He had never complained of discomfort, even though an infection of that sort ordinarily causes considerable pain. I suspect that Mao had a high tolerance of discomfort and so hated doctors and illness that he often endured his pain in silence</blockquote>



Li shows Mao as having barely a single noble impulse over twenty two years. All the same, you can see what people liked about him: in contrast to his writing and his policies, he was pretty earthy and informal and pragmatic and scruffy, and (as in his writing) he was actually idealistic and stoic.

<blockquote>when I told Mao the story of my friend’s encouragement to offer Yan a bribe, Mao laughed uproariously. “You bookworm,” he chided me. “Why are you so stingy? You don’t understand human relations. Pure water can’t support fish. What’s so strange about giving someone a present? Didn’t Guo Moruo give me a watch during the Chongqing negotiations...

Mao continued to talk excitedly about the latest production statistics. He had become curious about the works of the Soviet economist Leontief, wanting to compare economic organization in the Soviet Union with the new economic structures in China, and asked Chen Boda, Tian Jiaying, and Deng Liqun to join him in Guangzhou to study Leontief’s book on political economy.

The United States has also trained many skilled technicians for China,” Mao continued, a remark that would have been unthinkable for ordinary Chinese. The United States was still publicly reviled as China’s Enemy Number One and to praise it was counterrevolutionary. “So all of you belong to the British-American school,” Mao said. “I like people trained in England and the United States"</blockquote>



He is an extraordinary lesson in what happens when you operate on the level of social reality (what people think, manipulating animal spirits) and float free of reality.

<blockquote>What he learned during his visit was conclusive. High-quality steel can be produced only in huge modern factories using reliable fuel, like coal. But he gave no order to halt the backyard steel furnaces. The horrible waste of manpower and materials, the useless output from the homemade furnaces, was not his main concern. Mao still did not want to do anything to dampen the enthusiasm of the masses</blockquote>


I think this is one of the only laudable emotions we see:

<blockquote>[They were looking for the Buddhist] shrine his mother used to visit when he was sick, where she burned incense and fed the ashes to her son, certain of their curative powers. The tiny shrine, like the tombstone, had disappeared, torn down only months before with the establishment of the commune. The bricks were needed to build the backyard steel furnaces, and the wood had been used as fuel. Mao had fallen silent on our walk. The destruction of the shrine had saddened him</blockquote>



It's pretty crazy how much of policy was based off unrecorded offhand remarks. The end of the Great Leap, immediately after the shrine moment:

<blockquote>if you cannot produce good steel, you might as well quit.” With these words, Shaoshan probably became the first village in the country to abolish the public dining halls, halt its water conservancy project, and begin dismantling the backyard steel furnaces. Mao’s comments were never publicly released, but they spread quickly through word of mouth. Soon many areas were dismantling their projects</blockquote>



And of course he lost control of the Red Guards almost immediately after setting them off:

<blockquote>Liu Shaoqi was being “struggled against” outside the State Council auditorium. I ran there immediately... [he and his wife were] pushed and kicked and beaten by staff members from the Bureau of Secretaries. Liu’s shirt had already been torn open, and a couple of buttons were missing, and people were jerking his head around by the hair…Finally, they forced him down and pushed his face toward the ground until it was nearly touching the dirt, kicking him and slapping him in the face... Liu Shaoqi was already an old man by then, almost seventy, and he was our head of state...

Wang was in a difficult position. He could not inform Mao directly of the violence in Zhongnanhai. To make such a report would be to oppose a decision of the increasingly powerful Central Cultural Revolution Small Group, and no one would dare risk criticizing the rising leftists... "They just don’t listen to me,” [Mao] complained when I had finished, referring to the Central Cultural Revolution Small Group, which included his wife

</blockquote>




His authority evaporated completely at the moment of his death, with the factions bickering in the room with his body, and his written instructions to be cremated completely ignored - at the same time as his name became a holy relic of rectitude, still finding service today.

<blockquote>	Altogether we injected a total of twenty-two liters, some six more than the formula called for, hoping that the extra would provide some additional guarantee... The results were shocking. Mao's face was bloated, as round as a ball, and his neck was now the width of his
head. His skin was shiny, and the formaldehyde oozed from his pores like perspiration. His ears were swollen, too, sticking out from his head at right angles. Somehow we had to restore Mao to his original appearance, but there was no way to remove the formaldehyde. “It’s all right if his body stays bloated,” I said. “His clothes will cover it. But we had better try to fix his face and neck.” “Maybe if we massage them we can squeeze some of the liquid back into the body,” Zhang suggested. The team started working on Mao’s face with a towel and cotton balls, trying to force the liquid down into the body. When Chen pressed a little too hard, a piece of skin on Mao’s right cheek broke off</blockquote>

<br>
National history, except honest: all about the huge international effects coming in and firing out from the subject nation. Pittock is sceptical, as you have to be with things as romanticised and politicised as small-country national identity. He has a long popup box about how the Highlands are bullshit, for instance.

<blockquote>[There are now] five times as many Scots by birth or descent in the world as live in the country

The ‘first known British-flagged army in history’ was deployed on James’s authority in 1610, and ‘a Regiment of Britons’ (the majority of whom were Scots…
</blockquote>



The important bit, familiar to anyone paying attention (which excludes most Scots in my ken) is the enthusiastic role of Scots in conquest and slaving. (in the Scandinavian and Russian conquests as mercenaries, in Ulster and Darien as colonisers, later in the British Empire as subject imperialists crushing Quebec or sepoys or .) These empires would mot have worked without Scotch soldiers - 64 per cent of Swedish naval captains were Scottish by the late 1620s.,  the Scottish Army composed almost 60 per cent of [Cromwell’s] army . This is inconvenient for people who trade in symbols or consume them. It doesn’t much sound like an underdog. It’s easy to see why you’d want to portray your country as subjected to things rather than subjecting others to things.

As usual with history books, there’s a forest of irrelevant detail and you’re mostly left to divine the significant bits and judge how cherrypicked this all is yourself.

<blockquote> There were only fifty Scots in London in 1567… the total number of Scots in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ranged as high as 40,000.</blockquote>


But assuming you give a shit about the topic and can tell why e.g. the Covenant of 1638 is a big deal, it’s a good book. I wish he’d make judgments more -  Charles’ move to ally with Spain in return for troops to defeat the Covenanters in 1640 was alike toxic and incompetent: hallmarks of his government. - but he’s already above baseline for his profession.

It has been years since I read prose this academic though.

<blockquote> The Scotland of this study articulated itself distinctly in terms of its foundation myth and national story and its literary relationship to the classical and European generic and canonical traditions. It inflected and interpreted external influences – Dutch, French, English – towards its own specific conditions, and its people articulated themselves in national terms wherever they were in the world, performing identity in diaspora.</blockquote>


But I can still parse this stuff and Pittock lacks the vices that usually attend such constipated writing (vagueness, extremism, self-congratulation, lazy deconstruction, applause lights, innumeracy, bias). Actually a lot of it is concentrated in the introduction, so just skip that.

It took quite a long time for me to realise that Fowles might not endorse the nasty blithering of basically every character. (The book seems to have <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/07/the-great-divide-emily-nussbaum">Bad Fans</a> and Bad Haters who never realise this.)

<blockquote>
My monstrous crime was Adam's, the oldest and most vicious of all male selfishness: to have imposed the role I needed from Alison on her real self. 
</blockquote>


Anyway my time was recompensed by the great big postmodern explosion of the last 150 pages. Some very lovely passages throughout too:

<blockquote>
The bowed head, the buried face. She is silent, she will never speak, never forgive, never reach a hand, never leave this frozen present tense. All waits, suspended. Suspended the autumn trees, the autumn sky, anonymous people. A blackbird, poor fool, sings out of season from the willows by the lake. A flight of pigeons over the houses; fragments of freedom, hazard, an anagram made flesh. And somewhere the stinging smell of burning leaves.</blockquote>


The ending, so easily hated, does not strike me as meaning "to win love eternal, go on just hit her in the face", despite appearances. It is rather a parting stab at your opinion of Nicholas, a big Straussian dischord thrown into the supposed perfect cadence of the godgame people's efforts; Lily's grand second commandment dissolves suddenly, saltily, and then: a warm mist descends. Go guess.

Fine if you're a glutton for philosophical dialogues and Truman Show recursions.

Something witty and shocking and literary, in the urban fantasy genre? Yes: this RPG does the same secretly-magical subculture-glorifying thing as the rest of the 90s, but does it better. The genre might be better described as political horror - the same kind of logical extrapolation of conspiracy theories and occult 'wisdom' as <a href="http://unsongbook.com/">Unsong</a>.

Planes do not actually fly. It is a very elaborate hoax created because the general public does not understand or trust quantum teleportation.
Those games kids play—“step on a crack” and all that— are actually rituals that do stuff, but you’ve really got to believe in them. Kids believe in them, but don’t know what the rituals really do. That’s why kids can survive...
There is a cabal operating in fast food restaurants who want to take over the world by drugging the most popular fast food with powerful magical drugs.
The internet is one big engine. The faster the information flows, the more power it generates. If anyone could find out how to harness this power they could rule the world.
Brendan Behan’s pint glass sits behind the bar in a Dublin pub. Any who drink from it have words flow from them, but at what price?
Nearly every nursery rhyme originated as teaching tools for magicians. You don’t even want to know the magickal meaning of “Three Blind Mice.”
There’s a tape floating around containing a ritual to produce a soundtrack to the caster’s life. The intention was to never again miss anything suspicious or ignore a romantic moment. At the end there is only a long, eerie note—and then static.
There’s a sandwich shop in Atlanta where, if you order the special, along with a hot beverage, they include a small slip of paper telling you the date of your death. Most people just throw it away or eat it by accident.
There’s a kid in Little Rock, Arkansas who gains magical power from boredom.
The final scores of every year’s Superbowl are part of an ever-changing numerology formula that can start and stop wars.
Butane lighters with occult symbology contain listening devices in the bases. The company putting them out is trying to spy into the occult underground with these devices.
Aliens from Proxima Centauri have been living among us now for years, but in the last few months they’ve all started leaving.

The core mechanic is that there's always a catch: you have to sacrifice to gain magic. In particular, social deviance brings power. Each character has an obsession - the booze mage gets charges from drinking rare liquors, the wealth mage from squandering money, the skater mage from risky stunts, the porn mage from..., the self-harm mage from... This isn't trivial: to get the serious charges you have to permanently change your character. The spells in the book are just suggestions, the characters mostly have to make them up. And this is reflected in the <a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Fluff">fluff</a>: being edgy isn't a pose, it directly drives your alienation from society and mere reality. You go mad even if you win.

The back story is huge and silly (moves from control of the Street, to the World, to the Cosmos) but also excellent for long campaigns. <a href="">This thread</a> on a random dead forum is a key part of the book.

I'm a fourth-generation nonbeliever, in wishy-washy-secular Britain; really not sure why I got so caught up in New Atheism. Felt dead good to rebel against a weakened enemy with no recourse, I guess.

I can't remember much false in this, though these days I'd quibble with his argument against agnosticism ("we can't get conclusive evidence against the existence of gods, but the probability is low enough that in any other domain we'd have warrant for full disbelief; and 'atheism' is just this very-low-probability-assignment"). This is an argument against the word 'agnosticism' and is pointless except in PR terms.

<br>
I was on a date once and asked who her favourite thinker was. "Buckminster Fuller" she said. Struck dumb, I pedalled in the air for a second, then managed: "Ah cool. What about favourite like social thinker?" "Also Buckminster Fuller". In the years since 2010 I've always assumed she was an inexplicable anomaly, but it turns out that she would have fit right in during the 1970s, when the great fraud had hundreds of young disciples whose ideas and labour he stole. A lot like Steve Jobs and L Ron Hubbard, except a failure.

<blockquote>he organized students into divisions inspired by the aircraft industry, like a simulation of a company... a massively distributed virtual corporation that ran on the platform of the university system, in which he embedded himself like a virus...

The dome was going viral, and, like many social epidemics, including dianetics, it had spread through an existing network by word of mouth. Fuller was somewhat like a virus himself, with a unique talent for using a host to reproduce, and he carried the discoveries of each group of students to the next school on his list, burnishing his image as a genius by assimilating the work of many others. When credited to him alone, it made him seem staggeringly versatile...

Fuller’s writings and talks overflowed with misinformation and outright falsehoods, which he methodically built into the reality distortion field that allowed him to achieve so much in a single lifetime...

Albert Einstein, whose work he saw as confirming his own conclusions...

[Schwartz] became the first in a series of women outside his marriage to provide the creative support that he needed at each stage... Bare skin showed between the breastplates and the short skirt [he had designed for her]...

At MIT, Fuller asked students to check his math using trigonometric [tables] that went to fifteen decimal places, and when they refused to come out right, he interpreted it as “a message from God” that the tables themselves were wrong...

... at high speeds, its tail came off the road, leading to a dangerous lack of control... Decades later, he still insisted, “She was the most stable car in history”

Fuller had seen the universe as an omnitriangulated system of energy transactions...

He had yet to regain the trust of his mother, who had moved into a small farmhouse to pay his debts...

To maximize his freedom on his own terms, he had to control others, and in the absence of the usual incentives, he kept them in line with persuasion, charm, or anger, which repeatedly drove away collaborators. A cult of personality has always existed in architecture, but Fuller took it to extremes, since he lacked both real power and obvious monuments. He was a superb choreographer of other people’s lives, and as the nodes of his network grew further apart, it took on a familiar pattern. The biographer Alden Hatch thought that Fuller was “above all a mystic,” and although this reflected an authentic element of his character, it was also a tool to motivate others at a distance. Mystics, like start-up founders, tend to converge on similar strategies, and Fuller’s mysticism assumed a form that was appropriate for America in the age of the machine.</blockquote>


Previously I just found him amusing (in the exact way that <a href="https://youtu.be/WWRmBXhC7Cs?t=176">Tony Benn</a> is amusing) but after reading this I think I hate him. Incessantly dishonest and thieving. So dishonest that some people actually died as a result. Nevala-Lee lists hundreds of Fuller's lies. I've just found one more: he told the New Yorker that he was a "Distinguished Scientist" at the United States Institute of Behavioral Research; actually he was a mere "unpaid, intermittent consultant".

<blockquote>Fuller characterized it decades afterward as nothing short of a mystical epiphany: “I found myself with my feet not touching the pavement; I found myself in a sort of sparkling kind of sphere.” It was the dramatic appearance of a geometric shape that would dominate his life, and as he felt it surround him, a voice spoke with all the force of divine authority: “From now on, you need never await temporal attestation to your thought. You think the truth...</blockquote>


He couldn't have pulled off his con, let alone done so for 60 years, without the press lapping up his shit and promoting him all the time. The New Yorker:

<blockquote>it is no longer possible to question the practical application of these same principles in such eminently satisfactory structures as the geodesic dome, which has been recognized as the strongest, lightest, and most efficient means of enclosing space yet devised by man</blockquote>



A sloppy mystic, masquerading as Edison and Einstein and Gaudi combined. He seems to have stolen most of his ideas (from Le Corbusier, James Hewlett, Sterling Burgess, Isamu Noguchi, Kenneth Snelson, Shoji Sadao, and many others), or rather he gave them vague ideas and then claimed credit for the actual conceptualisation, design, and execution. 

One exception, which seems is <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/tablets.html?viewfullsite=1">ephemeralization</a>, a great prediction and one reason I am extremely hopeful about our environmental and economic future. Despite his total lack of redeeming qualities or output, he was an icon for progress, inspiring some people who actually did things. It seems we were missing a world-famous prophet of progress and radical experiment between 1980 and 2010?, until Musk took up the mandate.

You also have to admire the willingness to endure constant travel, work, and relative poverty for the cause, even if that cause was nonsense / self-aggrandizement and he leeched off his family and students to do it.

<blockquote>Fuller and Isamu Noguchi, who was back in town, slept on air mattresses and survived on doughnuts and coffee</blockquote>


His total lifetime output:
* 150 bad Stockade houses
* 3 silly lethal cars (not 3 models: 3 instances)
* a handful of housing domes
* 28 <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=richard+buckminster+fuller&oq=richard+buckminster+fuller">largely worthless patents</a>
* 28 uneven books
* thousands of lectures
* the word "synergy"
* Astonishingly extensive life logging, "140,000 pieces of paper, as well as 64,000 feet of film, 1,500 hours of audio tape, and 300 hours of video recordings"
* enough hot air to lift thousands of hearts

(Of the beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Biosphere">Montreal dome</a>: "In fact, he had minimal input on many of the structures with which he was associated, including the Montreal Expo Dome, which was seen as his masterpiece".)

Nevala-Lee is perhaps the first person to write him clearly - but even then he is not sceptical enough, he lets some rot through. A visionary, in the pejorative sense. A deferred inventor, an "inventor" in a future which never arrived, which could not arrive because its author was too incompetent and deluded.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36849043)">"Lives of the Eminent Philosophers"</a></h3>

Diogenes Laërtius (2018)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Mar 2023<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Nobody would waste a word about the lowbrow physiognomy of this writer if he were not by chance the dim-witted watchman who guards treasures without having a clue about their value</blockquote>

- Nietzsche

Incredibly long and boring book, loved it. (Boring except for Diogenes the Cynic of course - the Groucho Marx / GG Allin of the ancient world.) I thought I would only care about the doxographies (the actual philosophical claims) but they're the dullest part.

DL was a magpie and this is messy and repetitious and inconsistent enough that people think he died before finishing it. Some large fraction of all our knowledge of Greek thought is at the mercy of Laertius' honesty and whim. The scholar putting this edition together lists 250 ancient Greek sources (in total), and DL covers 70 of them, sometimes as the only source (like for Epicurus). He also shows off his little poems which is cute.

He repeats a lot of slanders and patent falsehoods, which is fine. De rigueur, he is also a completely unreconstructed Greek supremacist:

<blockquote>the Greeks, with whom not only philosophy but the human race itself began... 
those who attribute [philosophy's] invention to barbarians bring forward Orpheus the Thracian, declaring him a philosopher and the most ancient. For my part, I do not know whether one should call a person who spoke as he did about the gods a philosopher. And what should we call a man who did not hesitate to attribute to the gods all human experience, including the obscene deeds committed rarely by certain men with the organ of speech.</blockquote>

("Obviously that Turk didn't invent philosophy, because he says god sucks cock".)

False primacy is the funniest bit in the book. He is constantly saying absurd things like "[Plato] was the first to recognize the importance of scholarship", "[Solon] was the first to forgive a debt", "[Thales] was the first to call the last day of the month the thirtieth, and the first, as some say, to reason about nature."

I was amazed that people hated Epicurus from the beginning (thought this was a Judaeo-Christian thing), hilarious. "The last and most shameless of the natural philosophers, hailing from Samos, A schoolmaster, and the most ill-bred of animals... [They claim he said] 'Hoist every sail, my dear boy, and flee from all education' ... But these people are out of their minds [because Epicurus is a cinnamon bun]." DL reproduces his entire long will.

The first story about Plato that makes me admire him:

<blockquote>[Plato says tyrants are bad.] In his anger Dionysius said, “You talk like an old fart,” to which Plato replied, “And you like a tyrant.” Vexed at this, the tyrant was at first eager to have Plato put to death; then, dissuaded by Dion and Aristomenes, he did not go that far but entrusted Plato to Pollis the Spartan, who had just arrived on an embassy, with orders to sell him into slavery</blockquote>


Also, Plato as ethical slut:

<blockquote>Plato fell in love with a young man named Aster... and [with] Dion... he fell in love with Alexis and Phaedrus... He also had a passion for Archeanassa... And also to Agathon... An apple am I, tossed by one who loves you. Only consent, Xanthippe! For you and I are ripening on the vine.</blockquote>



It's not philosophy as we know it. DL is so uncritical that he makes e.g. Plato sound absurd and arbitrary:

<blockquote>there are three kinds of goods... There are three kinds of friendship... There are five forms of government... There are three kinds of justice... There are three kinds of knowledge... There are five kinds of medicine... There are two kinds of law... There are five kinds of speech... There are four kinds of nobility... There are three kinds of beauty... The soul is divided into three parts... There are four kinds of perfect virtue... Rule has five divisions... There are six kinds of rhetoric... Effective speaking has four aspects... There are four ways of conferring benefits... There are four ways in which things are accomplished and completed... There are four kinds of ability... There are three kinds of benevolence... Happiness has five aspects... Of the arts there are three kinds... Good is divided into four... There are three kinds of good civic order.... There are three kinds of lawlessness... There are three kinds of contraries... There are three kinds of advice... Voice is of two kinds... There are three kinds of music. One employs only the mouth, like singing. The second employs both the mouth and the hands, as when the harp player sings to his own accompaniment. The third employs only the hands, as in harp playing. Thus music may employ either the mouth alone, or both the mouth and the hands, or only the hands.... </blockquote>



Diogenes the Cynic is the main character, the most modern and recognisable of them. He is not so much a philosopher as a jester, a holy nutter though.

<blockquote>He called the school (scholēn) of Euclides “bile” (cholēn), Plato’s discourse (diatribēn) a “waste of time” (katatribēn)... to get through life one needed either reason (logon) or a noose (brochon).

He praised those who planned to marry and did not, those who proposed to sail and did not, those who were intending to pursue a political career and did not, those who planned to rear children and did not, and those who were preparing to consort with potentates and did not

when captured and put up for sale Diogenes was asked what he was good at. He replied, “Ruling over men"... To Xeniades, the man who purchased him, he said, “Be sure to do as I tell you"...

Diogenes, who had filled the bosom of his robe with beans

Seeing women who had been hanged from an olive tree, he said, “Would that all trees bore such fruit"

Asked where he came from, he replied, “I’m a citizen of the world" [an absurd thing to say at the time]

Asked what was the most beautiful thing in the world, he said, “Freedom of speech"

Many other sayings are attributed to him, which it would take too long to recount.

Still, he was admired by the Athenians. At any rate, when a young fellow had broken Diogenes’ tub they gave the boy a flogging and presented Diogenes with a new tub... others maintain that he died by holding his breath... Over his grave they stood a column, on which they placed the statue of a dog carved in marble from Paros. In the course of time his fellow citizens also honored him with bronze statues...</blockquote>



---

<blockquote>Diogenes Laertius seems to be an author whose work everyone in Renaissance Rome felt the need to own, but not to read. Among seven manuscripts... six are so perfectly preserved that they might have been written yesterday rather than half a millennium ago—virtually no one has touched them for five hundred years. It is downright depressing to think how few readers have ever seen the gorgeously illuminated capital P in MS Vaticanus Latinus 1891, with its pale pink dragonfly perched on a tendril of white filigree</blockquote>

Great fun!

Reynolds describes an <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/">Archipelago epistocracy</a> - that is, a loose collection of thousands of city-states with their own weird constitutions (voluntary fascisms, upload city, voluntary coma land, luxury Running Man land), with federal votes weighted by your past performance at predicting / causing good changes. The only federal crimes are voting related: messing with the central vote, denying their citizens the vote. (They don't seem to enforce the other thing you'd need to make this minimally acceptable: iron exit rights.) 

Reynolds is clearly also having fun here, where I found Revelation Space exhaustingly grim and sepia.

I particularly loved his entire society of <a href="https://michaelwstory.com/">professional</a> superforecasters / high-quality futarchist voting bloc, who make their living off lobbyists and being bellwethers and spend most of their time buggering about with hobbies. (You are ejected if your calibration drops below 50% better than normal people.)

He husbands his twists, and keeps almost all characters in the dark (including the antagonists) all the time. It also takes the horror of exponentials seriously; machine intelligence's scalability is the worst thing about it, and here we get two great scary instances.

One downside is that it feels like book #3 in a series; maybe one infodump too few or something.

The first story, 'Lena', is an instant classic that should be on every philosophy of mind syllabus. The others are at least clever.

The title story is a nice illustration of why existential risk is so concentrated in our near future (since if we make it through, we will have powerful guardians) and a very nice wishful-thinking companion to Gwern's 'Clippy'.

A common thread in the stories is the gross and complete failure of moral intuitions to cover new kinds of people (uploads, sims, those in lower dimensional projections). Capitalism is usually implied to be to blame, but in one of the stories it's a sunny green research project that dumps catastrophic waste into our yard, "legally speaking your Earth is as empty as Earth 2985b". How can you do this? Because you have a theory which lets you and no imagination to give you caution.

<blockquote>Why shouldn't I write of the fall of the Galactic Empire and of the return of feudalism, written from the viewpoint of someone in the secure days of the Second Galactic Empire? After all, I had read Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire not once, but twice.</blockquote>


Better! Asimov still can't do characters, but the Mule's lack of character is fitting, chilling - realistic for an authoritarian. Asimov is fit to write villains, in that sense.

Seldon is by this point in the tale identified with history itself:

<blockquote>"you can't beat a Seldon crisis by a far-fetched, impractical, storybook scheme like that. Suppose you had never got hold of the capsule. Suppose Brodrig hadn't used the word 'ultimate.' Seldon doesn't depend on wild luck." 
"If wild luck comes our way, there's no law says Seldon can't take advantage of it."</blockquote>

 
Or perhaps just any good part of history. Great trick!

(More seriously, history is full of wild luck. I don't pretend to know the magnitude of the contributions of structure and chance, groups and individuals. But 70% wouldn't surprise me.)

Psychohistory was one of the dreams of classical Marxism, even as written by someone supremely relaxed about markets and democracy. "The laws of history" indeed. ("For the first three centuries, the percentage probability of nondeviation is nine point four two." Current social science would be impressive to manage 9.42% for the first three minutes.) It's even foiled by genetics:

<blockquote>Can a genetic accident of unpredictable biological properties be taken into account in the Seldon Plan? [No.]</blockquote>



---

There's usually exactly one well-written passage in an Asimov book, and here it is:

<blockquote>To him, a stilted geometric love of arrangement was "system," an indefatigable and feverish interest in the pettiest facets of day-to-day bureaucracy was "industry," indecision when right was "caution," and blind stubbornness when wrong, "determination." 

And withal he wasted no money, killed no man needlessly, and meant extremely well. </blockquote>

 
(I explain this by A being a latently great writer who just never took the fucking time to be one.)

The Mule is extremely rational... he just has a very fucked up goal (to rule the universe before he dies prematurely without progeny). This is good villainy!

Hilary Mantel (2013)<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Aug 2020<br>
<br>
More of the same witty early moderns: modern speech atop medieval action. (Anachronistically witty, sceptical?) Mantel manages to make all the tiresome court manoeuvring interesting just by having it pass through Cromwell, her sensitive, competent monster.

Halfway through, Cromwell turns from rational underdog to corrupt totalitarian. Or, halfway through you realise that this turn has happened, that this aspect was there. He kills his enemies based on hearsay and jokes, zero physical and eyewitness evidence. Mantel manages this fall in a smooth and inevitable way. I complain about current legal systems a lot, but at least their errors are not this unjust and merely political.

<blockquote>When Gregory says, 'Are they guilty?' he means, 'Did they do it?' But when [Thomas] says, 'Are they guilty?' he means, 'Did the court find them so?' The lawyer's world is entire unto itself, the human pared away. It was a triumph, in a small way, to unknot the entanglement of thighs and tongues, to take that mass of heaving flesh and smooth it on to white paper: as the body, after the climax, lies back on white linen. He has seen beautiful indictments, not a word wasted.
</blockquote>



<blockquote>“Nothing makes you falter,” Wyatt says. He says it with a reluctant admiration that is close to dread. But he, Cromwell, thinks, I did falter but no one knows it, reports have not gone abroad. Wyatt did not see me walk away from Weston’s interrogation. Wyatt did not see me when Anne asked me what I believed in my heart.

He rests his eyes on the prisoner, he takes his seat. He says softly, “I think I have been training all my years for this. I have served an apprenticeship to myself.” His whole career has been an education in hypocrisy. 
</blockquote>




Lots of artistic licence, to patch over the huge gaps in the historical record (as Mantel admits in the postscript). Cromwell is sympathetic here, even with all the blood and lies - you notice his evil only after effort. But this is just the same treatment that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More#Campaign_against_the_Protestant_Reformation">Thomas More</a> has enjoyed for a hundred years, in several <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDBiLT3LASk">beautiful retcons</a>.
