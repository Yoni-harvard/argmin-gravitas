      <td><i>The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer</i> (1995) by Neal Stephenson</td>
      <td>Amazed that this is from 1995; its concerns feel very current - too current. The nations of the world collapse from cryptocurrency destroying the tax base; they are replaced with <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Polystate-Thought-Experiment-Distributed-Government-ebook/dp/B00IM5EM7W">voluntary</a> <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/">ideological associations</a>, including trads ("neo-Victorians" and techno-Confucians) who are shown thriving where others suffer civil war, state failure, and ordinary poverty and abuse. Everyone has fancy nanotechnology, which solves absolute poverty and allows massive structures to be built of solid diamond.<br/><br/>That's all in the background, where the foreground is a theory of education and rebellion, of social degeneration and regeneration. The leader of the Victorians designs the best educational game ever, a 12-year-long adventure game with live narration. He does this because there's a shortage of subversion and rebellion in his society, and he wants to train his granddaughter to be independent. (He also says the neo-Vickys have an associated shortage of great artists, but to put it mildly this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Victorian_novelists">not something</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_artists#Born_1800%E2%80%931899">the originals</a> suffered.)<br/><br/>In particular, Stephenson was <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html">a bit</a> obsessed with moral relativism in the 90s; he harps on the superiority of realism, or communitarianism, or status regulation, or sincerity, or something, in most of his books. Superficially, his concern matches one annoying strain of internet writing of the last few years - the clickbait strawmaneering of the Petersons and the Lindsays. But French Theory <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/french-thought-once-dazzled-the-world-what-went-wrong">fell</a> in the meantime, outside of a few academic subcultures with little influence, so Stephenson can be right while these guys are wrong. An excess of scepticism and irony - a deficit of shaming and judgment - does not strike me as the first problem with the mores of 2020.<br/><br/>Stephenson saves most of the nice bits of the book for the Vickys, and his attempt to recover what was good about the original Victorians (their energy, inventiveness, duty, taste) ignores a lot of what was bad about them. (Though he actively endorses their hypocrisy about sex, he would have to think again about their betraying their Christian universalism with retributive justice and imperialism.)<br/><blockquote><i><br/>"when I was a young man, hypocrisy was deemed the worst of vices," Finkle-McGraw said. "It was all because of moral relativism. You see, in that sort of a climate, you are not allowed to criticise others--after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism?...<br/><br/>"Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others' shortcomings. And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices. For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what he has espoused with what he has actually done... Virtually all political discourse in the days of my youth was devoted to the ferreting out of hypocrisy."<br/><br/>"That we occasionally violate our own stated moral code," Major Napier said, working it through, "does not imply that we are insincere in espousing that code." <br/>"Of course not," Finkle-McGraw said. "It's perfectly obvious, really. No one ever said that it was easy to hew to a strict code of conduct."<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Having "Victorian" characters means he gets to have fun with his dialogue; there are dozens of words I've never seen before in this, and several children crafting exquisitely balanced subordinate clauses.<br/><br/>About a third too long, and that's with him completely truncating the excellent Judge Fang plotline. As always, he is incapable of writing a good ending. Maybe 4 stars on re-read.</td>

Mantel manages to make all the tiresome court manoeuvring interesting just by having it pass through Cromwell, her sensitive, competent monster.<br/><br/>Halfway through, Cromwell turns from rational underdog to corrupt totalitarian. Or, halfway through you realise that this turn has happened, that this aspect was there. He kills his enemies based on hearsay and jokes, zero physical and eyewitness evidence. Mantel manages this fall in a smooth and inevitable way. I complain about current legal systems a lot, but at least their errors are not this unjust and merely political.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>When Gregory says, 'Are they guilty?' he means, 'Did they do it?' But when [Thomas] says, 'Are they guilty?' he means, 'Did the court find them so?' The lawyer's world is entire unto itself, the human pared away. It was a triumph, in a small way, to unknot the entanglement of thighs and tongues, to take that mass of heaving flesh and smooth it on to white paper: as the body, after the climax, lies back on white linen. He has seen beautiful indictments, not a word wasted.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><i>‚ÄúNothing makes you falter,‚Äù Wyatt says. He says it with a reluctant admiration that is close to dread. But he, Cromwell, thinks, I did falter but no one knows it, reports have not gone abroad. Wyatt did not see me walk away from Weston‚Äôs interrogation. Wyatt did not see me when Anne asked me what I believed in my heart.<br/><br/>He rests his eyes on the prisoner, he takes his seat. He says softly, ‚ÄúI think I have been training all my years for this. I have served an apprenticeship to myself.‚Äù His whole career has been an education in hypocrisy. <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>Lots of artistic licence, to patch over the huge gaps in the historical record (as Mantel admits in the postscript). Cromwell is sympathetic here, even with all the blood and lies - you notice his evil only after effort.

This subculture hid inside the superhuman apolitical dreamland, mathematics.* It could only exist because of the sacrifices of famous and decent men, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3376">Kolmogorov</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Danilovich_Aleksandrov">Aleksandrov</a>. Their selective maths schools seem to have been the only nice places to be in the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Empire">empire</a>, for any intellectual with a taste for actual discourse, or for the truth.<br/><br/>(Reasons it can't be so much a biography: the subject refused to talk to her, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman#Possible_withdrawal_from_mathematics">does things</a> that are very hard to explain, and doesn't go out much.)<br/><br/>The teacher Ryzhik's story about the evil entrance exam he sat is so, so sad:<br/><blockquote><i>  ‚ÄúCoffins‚Äù were questions specially designed for the Jewish applicants... rejection was administered in a peculiarly sadistic way... if [Jews] succeeded in answering correctly the two or three questions on the ticket, then, alone in the room with the examiners, they would be casually issued an extra question... a problem not merely complex but unsolvable. The examiners would then nail the cover of the coffin shut: the Jewish applicant had failed the exam...<br/><br/>"They did not even manage to find a problem I couldn't solve; I sat for three hours after the exam was over, I solved them all, and still they failed me. I was just a boy. I went home and cried."<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Gessen is well-placed to write this - she was a maths nerd in Soviet Russia around the same time. As far as I can tell (which isn't very far) her grasp of the maths (one chapter for the crown jewel) is fit for purpose. But Gessen is out to bust Perelman's reputation for hyper-individualism; so she focusses on the devoted teachers and functionaries that pulled strings to get an abrasive Jew into the heart of Soviet academia, and his incredible luck in starting graduate study just as Glasnost happened.<br/><br/>    She wants to highlight the poverty of his character - his antisocial withdrawal, his complete and intentional ignorance of politics, his naivete, his savantism. It doesn't work. Yes, he's rigid; maybe he is composed of a curiosity, a competitiveness, an ethics, and nothing else (no vanity, humour, romance, charisma, empathy, theory of mind, tolerance, compromise, doubt). <br/><br/>So what? Why does everyone need to be rounded? Does she sneer at athletes, the other people with lives this seemingly contorted and simple? <a href="https://www.esquire.com/sports/a5151/the-string-theory-david-foster-wallace/">David Foster Wallace</a> managed to get over himself, on this note:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    The restrictions on [pro tennis player's] life have been, in my opinion, grotesque; and in certain ways Joyce himself is a grotesque. But the radical compression of his attention and sense of himself have allowed him to become a transcendent practitioner of an art ‚Äì something few of us get to be. They've allowed him to visit and test parts of his psychic reserves most of us do not even know for sure we have (courage, playing with violent nausea, not choking, et cetera).<br/><br/>Joyce is, in other words, a complete man, though in a grotesquely limited way. <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>    Gessen is, to be frank, quite cruel: she never passes up an opportunity to mention appearances - that that athletic boy of 1970 is "<i>now an overweight and balding computer scientist</i>", that the house of a man caring for his wife with late-stage dementia is "<i>a messy place, lived in awkwardly</i>" and he himself "<i>similarly unkempt</i>"; that Perelman didn't change his underwear or clip his nails as a teen. This is the shallow side of the <i><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/masha-gessen">New Yorker</a></i> style on show - or else the malign side of Russian honesty. Either way fuck it. (Though Perelman would probably approve.)<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>   [Perelman] sounded his voice only if a solution required his intervention; looked forward to Sundays, sighing happily and saying that he could "finally solve some problems in peace"; and, if asked, patiently explained any math issue to any of his classmates though apparently utterly unable to conceive of anyone not comprehending such a simple thing. His classmates repaid him with kindness: they recalled his civility and his mathematics, and none ever mentioned to me that he walked around with his shoelaces undone...<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>The great mystery, which Gessen understandably can't touch, is why after 36 years of focus he suddenly stopped doing the only thing he'd ever done. How could he? How can that much momentum be shed? What does such a man do next?<br/><br/>Subtract a star if you don't care about maths or if you can't abide people being mean to nerds (as both the old apparatchiks and Gessen were).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>* One of the oddest things about Perelman, because it maybe explains him turning down a million quid and the highest honours the world can bestow, is that he'd disagree with that sentence: <i>maths</i>, the least animal and least irrational thing we have, is too political for him. There was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau#Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture_controversy">a little bit</a> of nasty jostling at the time of the announcement - but nothing compared to any other science, let alone any government. Maybe the bubble everyone set up for him was bad for him, because it robbed him of perspective and so made the mild case of fuckery seem like a complete invalidation of mathematical culture. But maybe a rigorous rule-based mind would always explode eventually even given a scale to measure instances of bias.</td>

In the late 1940s, during the Chinese civil war, Erd≈ës took part in a food drive for the Communist Chinese. "I remember walking into a big room in Los Angeles, at UCLA, I think," said Vazsonyi, "and there was Erd≈ës and all these people making packages of food. Some mischief-makers who knew of his disgust at naked women offered to make a $100 donation if he'd go with them to a burlesque show." To their astonishment, he immediately took them up on the offer. Afterwards, when they forked over the $100, he revealed the secret of his victory: "See! I tricked you, you trivial beings! I took off my glasses and did not see a thing!"</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Unlike <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2664633920">Perelman</a>, the other late-C20th-century mathematical saint, Erd≈ës had a wicked sense of fun and style.

He said that Horthy supporters and other Fascist sympathizers were "on the short wavelength." That's also when he started calling children and other small things "epsilons," grandchildren "epsilons squared," alcohol "poison," music "noise," and women "bosses," an inversion of what Hungarian women often called their husbands. "Give me an epsilon of poison," Erdos would say when he wanted a sip of wine. "Wine, women, and song" became "Poison, bosses, and noise."<br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>He then had a huge argument with the surgeon about why, since only one eye was being deadened [during his cornea transplant], he couldn't read a mathematics journal with the other, good eye. The surgeon made a series of frantic calls to the Memphis math department. "Can you send a mathematician over here at once so that Erdos can talk math during surgery?" The department obliged, and the operation went smoothly.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Unfortunately only half of this is anecdotes about Erd≈ës, the rest being the usual potted-history of quirky mathematicians (Archimedes the oblivious, Fermat the executioner, Gauss the crabbed, Hardy the dry eccentric, Ramanujan the sublime, Wiles the Stakhanovite) with the usual stories.

So, superficially, the book is just about an especially  <a name="people"></a>fruity context of discovery. But this period holds two of the most important lessons in history: 1) science grew out of work by people who diverge wildly from the modern idea and practice of science, whose variously false frameworks led to the Royal Society and e.g. the Newtonian triumph. (And from there to contemporary, professional, university science.) So wrong people can still make progress if their errors are uncorrelated with the prevailing errors. And, 2) a small number of the most powerful people in Britain - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon">Lord Chancellor</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Scarborough">king's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey#Excursions_abroad.2C_election_as_physician_to_Charles_I_and_the_English_Civil_War">physicians</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkins">the chaplain</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_Louis,_Elector_Palatine">young Elector Palatine</a> and bishop of Chester, London's great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren#Architectural_career">architect</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moray">Privy Councillors</a> <a href="#bigfrankb">*</a> - successfully pushed a massive philosophical change, and thereby contributed to most of our greatest achievements: smallpox eradication, Sputnik and Voyager, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a>, and the unmanageably broad boons of computing are partly theirs. <br/><br/>The received view of all this is one-dimensional: you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_Concerning_the_Two_Chief_World_Systems">superstitious, pompous cretins</a> at one end and rational, experimental moderns at the other.<br/><br/>But really you need five axes before you get a basic understanding of the great, great revolution that began in the C16th - before you can see how science differs from every other community: <br/><br/><ul><br/><li><b>Supernaturalism vs Naturalism</b>. Did they explain things solely in terms of natural causes? (Absentee Gods only.)</li><br/><li><b>Apriori vs Aposteriori</b>. Did they view actual observation as decisive and indispensable? <a href="#empiricism">**</a></li><br/><li><b>Qualitative vs Quantitative.</b> Did they make measurements? Did they model the data? Did they use standard units?</li><br/><li><b>Holism vs Reductionism.</b> Did they analyse things into their constituent features? Did they explain phenomena in terms of ?</li><br/><li><b>Infallibilism vs Fallibilism.</b> Did they allow for the possibility of error? Did they view uncertain knowledge as still worthwhile? <a href="#fallibilism">***</a></li><br/>****<br/></ul>^<br/><br/>So I'm modelling science as naturalist, fallibilist, quantitative empiricism with pretensions to openness. I've categorised the early scientists mentioned in <i>Curiosity</i> according to this: you can see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Bw1pqa-ZcGza9P3jV7wht8o9-xEJw0A0GpdN733MqE/edit?usp=sharing">the data with additional justifications here</a>. (Ball doesn't state this model, but it floats around in his debunkings and "well actually"s.)<br/><br/>All of the pieces of science are very ancient - we had mathematics and data collection <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322">well before the Ten Commandments</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus">naturalism</a> before Buddha and Confucius, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism#Greek_atomism">reductionism</a> before the Peloponnesian War at least <a href="http://tunesforbears.com/a-history-of-randomization/">one controlled trial</a> centuries before Christ, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/carneades/#3">fallibilism</a> likewise. Everything was ready BCE; we can see indirect evidence of this in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile">astonishing</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_screw">works</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesibius#Inventions">of</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byzantium#Devices">Ancient Greek</a> engineers, mostly unmatched for 1000 years until y'know. <br/><br/>So the question is not "was Bacon the most original blah blah?": he wasn't, particularly when you remember Alhazen's Baconian method, developed in the C11th. But we need an explanation for how we messed it up so badly. The received view, which is all I have at the moment, is that the fall of Rome, Christian anti-intellectualism and, later, the enshrining of Aristotelian mistakes was enough to destroy and suppress the ideas. I want deeper explanations though. (For instance, what did we do to the economy?)<br/><br/>A fun regression on this data would be to see how my scienciness measure correlates with the importance of the person's work. It would not be that highly proportional, in this time period. <br/><br/><br/>***************************************************************<br/><br/>Back to the book eh! Book structure is lots of little chapters on fairly disjointed topics: early modern ideas of space travel, universal language, pumps, etc. Chapter on "cabinets of curiosity" is great though: suddenly their dull zany blare makes sense and I want to build one:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>this was more than a case of 'look what I've got'. The power with which </i>Wunderkammern<i> were imbued was... in that they created their own complete microcosm: a representation of the world in miniature... By possessing this microcosm the collector-prince was not just symbolising but also in a sense </i>exercising<i> his mastery of the world. The cabinet acted as a kind of mental laboratory within which the relationships between things could be contemplated via a process that shared elements of both experimentation and Gnostic revelation.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>Ball doesn't like us calling the Scientific Revolution a revolution, and I agree: the revolution didn't consist in the theories of Bacon or Newton: it consists in the diffusion of the worldview into all subjects and all inquiry. It transformed society and gave us marvels, but it hasn't finished happening. The general will, or default state, is still strongly unscientific. (The largest and most grievous holdout, larger even than the enduring hold of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fideism">fideist</a> religion, is our tribal politics and our largely nonempirical government policy.)<br/><br/>Ball expends a lot of time on a history of wonder vs curiosity vs dispassionate robot inquiry. People hated all of these things for various reasons, up until the Renaissance when curiosity became acceptable on what are now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_skies_research">classic economic grounds</a>, or in line with the Italian cult of the virtuoso - someone who's so bloody brilliant that you have to just let him get on with it.<br/><br/>I always like Ball's drawling prose and catty editorialising. (For instance, Margaret Cavendish - the darling of arts academics who latch on to the only woman in sight in this period - gets a round dissing by Ball, as an anti-experiment idiot, a vitalist, and a misogynist.) Stimulating as always.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Bacon has some claim to being the most influential philosopher ever, in terms of counterfactual effect on history. (Rather than number of bloody citations!) No-one with his social standing was resisting the Aristotelian consensus in 1620; his prototype scientific method is a century ahead of its time. (Yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham#Scientific_method">ibn al-Haytham</a>'s was 7 centuries ahead of its time, but to limited avail.)<a href="#people">‚èé</a><br/><a name="empiricism"></a> <br/><br/>** This one is hard to refer to, because we now find it incredibly easy to understand why "go and look" works as a general route to knowledge; Medieval thought rejected this on the basis of things like the problem of induction. <br/><br/>The cliched way to refer to the split between those who want to <i>start</i> with the apriori and those who want to start with data is "Rationalism" vs "Empiricism". But these words <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/27/why-i-am-not-rene-descartes/">confuse people</a>: the two of them are also used in a C17th debate about psychology, to do with the nature of mental content. <br/><br/>More: it can't be a dichotomy, since many of the greatest rationalists (Descartes, Leibniz) were experimentalists too, doing what we now call empirical work. Three meanings of rationalism, and three words for them:<br/><ul><li>'Rationalism<sub>1</sub>': Belief in innate ideas. Call it 'Continental Rationalism'. Descartes and Leibniz but not Dawkins and Shermer.</li><br/><li>'Rationalism<sub>2</sub>': Belief in the supremacy of apriori knowledge over empirical knowledge. Call it 'apriorism'. Aristotle was apriorist, as was Descartes.</li><br/><li>'Rationalism<sub>3</sub>': Belief that everything should be subject to reason and evidence. Includes Descartes and Leibniz <i>and</i> Dawkins and Shermer. Contemporary rationalists are highly if not radically empiricist.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><br/>I use <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2011/07/leibniz-experimental-philosopher/">Alberto Vanzo</a>'s criteria for deciding if someone was enough of an experimentalist:<br/><blockquote><blockquote><i> let us consider four typical features of early modern experimental philosophers:<br/><br/>    <ul><li></i>self-descriptions<i>: experimental philosophers typically called themselves such. At the very least, they professed their sympathy towards experimental philosophy.</li><br/>   <li></i>friends and foes<i>: experimental philosophers saw themselves as part of a tradition whose ‚Äúpatriarch‚Äù was Bacon and whose sworn enemy was Cartesian natural philosophy.</li><br/>    <li></i>method<i>: experimental philosophers put forward a two-stage model of natural philosophical inquiry: first, collect data by means of experiments and observations; second, build theories on the basis of them. In general, experimental philosophers emphasized the a posteriori origins of our knowledge of nature and they were wary of a priori reasonings.</li><br/>    <li></i>rhetoric<i>: in the jargon of experimental philosophers, the terms ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù and ‚Äúobservations‚Äù are good, ‚Äúhypotheses‚Äù and ‚Äúspeculations‚Äù are bad. They were often described as fictions, romances, or castles in the air.</i></li><br/></ul><br/></blockquote></blockquote><br/>This is unusually inclusive: the famous Rationalist Leibniz counts as experimental under this rubric. But a stronger definition of aposteriorist - like "refuses to use purely analytic reasoning", or even "spent most of their time running experiments and analysing data" would exclude many contemporary scientists. Sticking with Vanzo for now.  <a href="#model">‚èé</a><br/><br/><a name="fallibilism"></a><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*** Hard to imagine a fallibilist apriorist: perhaps Lakatos. (Some say Leibniz was, in practice.) I actually have met a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism_(philosophy)">methodist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_skepticism">infallibilist apriorist</a>, but I won't meet another.  <a href="#model">‚èé</a><br/><a name="openness"></a><br/><br/><br/>**** I had included "openness" in the model -<br/><ul><br/><li><b>Obscurantism vs Openness.</b> Did they write in the vernacular? Did they publish for a wide readership? Did they spurn Noble Lies? Did they encourage replications with and data sharing? Did they build scholarly networks?</li><br/></ul><br/>- but I admit this is just wishful/normative thinking: modern academic science fails at this. Whether with its low-status replications, unreadable prose, paywalls on most research (tax-funded or no), pathetically low levels of data sharing, or the <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2015-cofnas.pdf">prevalence of noble lies</a>... But it's definitely a core <i>aspiration</i> now: the greedy impulse behind hermeticism is blatantly unscientific, if not actually shunned by actual scientists. First, lip service...  <br/><br/>Things can be science without being published, obviously: consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#History">invention of public key cryptography</a> by a GCHQ wonk, classified for 25 years - or even the secret <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Low-latency_strategies">infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Statistical_arbitrage">algorithmics</a> of high-frequency trading.<br/><br/>^ Obviously these five factors aren't the end of the matter either. But I reckon it catches a decent amount of the variance in the term "scientist". Others e.g.<br/><ul><br/><li>Particularism vs Consilience. Did they believe that the scientific method could explain every phenomenon?</li><br/><li>Realism vs Instrumentalism. Most scientists are realists about best current theories</li><br/><li>Theism vs Nontheism</li><br/></ul><br/>I <i>had</i> included non-theism in the core of modern science - and so it is, in the form of strong naturalism. Scient<i>ists</i>, on the other hand, differ from this, globally. This is partially because humans are so compartmentalised and can hold severe contradictions indefinitely. But, clearly, atheism is not an essential part of the modern method. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_closure">causal closure</a> and (at most) a <i>private</i> faith are.</td>

      <td>Rousing history of one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll">worst</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics">things</a> that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.<br/><br/>Barry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with <b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875246">25-100</a></b> million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:<br/><blockquote><i>  It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.</i></blockquote><br/>Or ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133682">weird habit</a> of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4024220/">a thousand times</a> <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/202871/number-of-fatalities-by-terrorist-attacks-worldwide/">more lethal</a>.)<br/><br/>So: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).<br/><br/>Except it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140123-spanish-flu-1918-china-origins-pandemic-science-health/">human displacements</a>. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.<br/><br/>The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>Man might be defined as ‚Äúmodern‚Äù largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.<br/><br/>By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was "the withered arm of science". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, "we can't really do anything") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel‚Äôs message was simple: This doesn‚Äôt work. That doesn‚Äôt work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.</i></blockquote><br/>Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.<br/><br/>Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae">the wrong pathogen</a>, due to a bad guess by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Friedrich_Johannes_Pfeiffer">extremely eminent researcher</a>.<br/><br/>Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:<br/><blockquote><i>In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person‚Äôs breathing. <br/><br/>The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses‚Äî43 percent of the staff‚Äîthemselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered ‚Äúeven a little‚Äù of their profession.<br/><br/>When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...<br/><br/>Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn‚Äôt forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient‚Äôs vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.<br/><br/>Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies ‚Äî and could be killing them...<br/>The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, ‚ÄúThe life of the city had almost stopped.‚Äù<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.<br/><blockquote><i>The corpses had backed up at undertakers‚Äô, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.<br/><br/>The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow...<br> More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.</i></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>"<i>There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. "</i></blockquote>- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.<br/><br/><br/>Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. ("<i>at last the world knows America as the savior of the world</i>!") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/germany-telegraphs-president-wilson-seeking-armistice">with the Kaiser's new parliament</a> in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?dcr=0&q=18000000+%2F+1559+*+70&oq=18000000+%2F+1559+*+70&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1761.1839.0.1945.2.2.0.0.0.0.87.87.1.1.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..2.0.0.UNPLBXOgOHQ">800,000</a> completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.<br/><br/><blockquote><i> the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_of_1918">ban on criticising the government</a>. But then there's the unofficial "patriotic duties", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation‚Äôs attention and intent on the war.<br/><br/>He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America‚Äôs shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America‚Äôs military from British and French weapons and munitions‚Äîfor, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.<br/><br/>He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning ‚Äî some for prison terms longer than ten years ‚Äînot just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_L._Berger">a congressman</a>.<br/><br/>He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation‚Äôs history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his ‚Äúwork or fight‚Äù order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...<br/><br/>Crowder bragged about doing ‚Äúin a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect..."<br/><br/>In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster‚Äîimmediate disaster‚Äîwould follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later ‚Äî days of battle and deaths ‚Äî the Austrian note remained unanswered.<br/><br/>Earlier Wilson had spoken of a ‚Äúpeace without victory,‚Äù believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...<br/><br/>If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources.<br/><br/>...the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas‚Äôs office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas‚Äôs superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:<br/><blockquote><i>In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without ‚Äúimmediate medical assistance the race‚Äù could become ‚Äúextinct.‚Äù...<br/><br/>The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found ‚Äúthree wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths‚Ä¶ Survivors generally children‚Ä¶ probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.‚Äù<br/><br/>The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs.  The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>---<br/>Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having "no standards for admission":<br/><blockquote><i>  In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. <br/></i></blockquote><br/>But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.<br/><br/>I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)<br/>---<br/><br/>PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist <a href="http://www.virology.ws/2009/08/14/the-problems-with-barrys-the-great-influenza/">here</a>.

Of course, this makes for good aesthetics and bad epistemics.<br/><br/>Like <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/">Charlie Stross</a>, Watts reads horrifying things into the news, informed by the toxic half of history but also by a nebulous paranoia which leads them astray. (Representative sample from Stross: "<i>[media incentive] has been weaponized, in conjunction with data mining of the piles of personal information social networks try to get us to disclose (in the pursuit of advertising bucks), to deliver toxic propaganda straight into the eyeballs of the most vulnerable ‚Äî with consequences that are threaten to undermine the legitimacy of democratic governmance on a global scale.</i>". Watts:<br/><blockquote><i>Bureaucratic and political organisms are like any other kind; they exist primarily to perpetuate themselves at the expense of other systems.

It is no shame to fall for either: these are highly respectable academic hoaxes, and Bem's methods were <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-statistical-crisis-in-science">exactly as valid</a> as the average psychology paper of the early C21st. Watts' mistake isn't to insist that ESP is real, but to leap to the defence of the weird just because it is weird, to the point where he rejects Hume's maxim ("<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00117/full">Laplace's principle</a>"), a basic incontrovertible <i>theorem</i> of <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Extraordinary_claims_require_extraordinary_evidence#Probability_theory">Bayesian inference</a>. <br/><blockquote><i>these results, whatever you thought of them, were at least as solid as those used to justify the release of new drugs to the consumer market.

He is also completely off the deep end on climate change as existential risk, sneering at anyone who disagrees, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmHh-cshTCMT8LX0Y5wSQm8FMBhaxhQ8OlOeRLkXIF0/edit#">no</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/13/18660548/climate-change-human-civilization-existential-risk">matter</a> <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eJPjSZKyT4tcSGfFk/climate-change-is-in-general-not-an-existential-risk">how</a> <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/will-climate-change-wipe-out-humanity-opinion-1440384">well-informed</a>. <br/><blockquote><i>there‚Äôs no denying that pretty much every problem in the biosphere hails from a common cause.

It would crude to explain away Watts' style and worldview by reference to his unusually bad luck: his flesh-eating disease, his inexplicable beatdown and prosecution by border cops, his publishing travails, his scientific and romantic flops. <br/><br/>Disclaimer: I'm probably only so down on him because I got so excited by <i>Blindsight</i> and its promise of actual science fiction by an actual scientist.

(Ian Watson and Abnett are two I know about.)<br/><br/>The first 150 pages here have no giant robots, only the quiet apprehensive horror of a war economy, war emotions. Lovers parted by conscription, blocks of lives traded for nothing, the belligerent joy of a public which hasn't lost its first battle yet. Then you get plenty of omnipotent bots, a conspiracy, and two parties in desperate retreat.<br/><br/>I like the Mechanicus because, unlike the rest of their society they are half-rational, occasionally have to confront the pervasive superstition and noble lies.<br/><br/>Several times you get a unique twist on PTSD, from old men who spent decades inhabiting a war machine:<br/><blockquote><i>Zink hobbled over to his hut at the best full stride his old legs could manage. He took out the worn step ladder that he used for pruning the boughs of the ploin trees, and carried it back to the west wall. This execution took the best part of half an hour, and Zink had to stop and catch his breath twice. More than twice, he forgot what he was about and began to carry the ladder back to the hut. When he reached the wall, he came about, two points, low stride, west rotation, and dragged the ladder into the wet flowerbeds.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>I struggle a bit with the psychology of the wicked Satanic enemy. Even in thoughtful authors like Abnett their motivations and strategies are too predictably vicious, too unsustainable - they've invaded this planet, fine, but then they blow up half the cities in it. So what's the point of invading?<br/><blockquote><i>The archenemy, in his long experience, often ignored <br/>tactical logic or strategic merit, but this was an odd choice even by the archenemy‚Äôs perverse standards.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>An enemy who was so haphazard, divided, unstrategic would struggle to threaten a whole organised empire. They could just be terrorists, or value suffering itself, or just be damaging infrastructure for the wider conflict. But this is a flat worldview, one you can't do anything with except backdrop the nobility of your own characters. Which is one reason there's not a lot of literature in this canon. Abnett compensates well as usual, with flawed and distinctive protagonists, rigorous fantasy logistics and tactics, nice setpieces, plenty of humanising nonmilitary detail, and good satisfying betrayals.</td>

Well there's the stated reason, via Hawking:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>With climate change, overdue asteroid strikes, epidemics, and population growth, our own planet is increasingly precarious.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>But does this argument from reduction of existential risk go through? Probably not - most x-risk is due to us, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCfLheUxHEI">not volcanoes or asteroids or gamma bursts</a>, and we should expect this kind of risk to reduce only modestly in a multiplanetary setting, since the act of colonisation carries the risk source, us, with it; and there are much cheaper and more developed ways of preventing extinction, like arms control and AI research. And we're (even) more likely to have large conflicts when the cultural distances, between planetary civilisations, are so much larger. <br/><br/>So what? Is it our genes, new-pastures wanderlust? The sheer scale? <br/><br/>There's a lot of ostentation in the book, unnecessary mentions of Zegna suits and fancy watches and whatnot (perhaps intended to make us suspicious of the investors and lawyers who wear them - but we already have them <i>admitting</i> that they are motivated by egomania and envy). The billionaire at the heart of the plot is a suitable mix of inspirational, reckless, authoritarian, noble, ignoble. <br/><br/>Props to Suarez for using <a href="http://spaceengine.org/">SpaceEngine</a> and <a href="https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/">Kerbal</a> to model the precise trajectory of his crew, though many extra points would have accrued had he open-sourced the run, for the purposes of scientific hermeneutics. Also for his bibliography and dissing <a href="https://www.space.com/21554-mars-toxic-perchlorate-chemicals.html">Mars colonisation</a>. <br/><br/>Suarez' claim that a single asteroid trip could make a trillion dollars is contradicted in <a href="http://www.weeklyweinersmith.com/?p=858">the Weinersmith's pop book</a>, where they emphasise the legal headaches, and that the profits are conditional on a huge increase in human space activity (otherwise not much demand for your LEO wares). This is all I know, and it's not very strong evidence either way.<br/><br/><br/>*********************************<br/><br/>How does it do as Serious science fiction?<br/><br/><i>Social development</i>: None. One thing which doesn't happen much IRL is the <spoiler>financial <i>and</i> literal suicide mission by a billionaire for the purposes of driving humanity forward</spoiler>, but this is just ordinary audacity scaled up. I like the extrapolation of <a href="https://space-agency.public.lu/en.html">Luxembourg</a>'s space industry, the ultimate colonial underwriting. The secret construction of a spaceship in HEO is implausible at the moment but <i>might</i> not be in a few decades.<br/><br/><i>Software development</i>: Yes! The mission is almost lost several times due to software problems, and Ade is the most critical crewmember because of his top monkeypatching and hacking skills (hacking in both senses).<br/><br/><i>Actual science</i>: Yes. The gravity ship is actually basic physics, just incredibly hard and expensive engineering (Joyce drops something like $45bn on the project, which sounds about right). The economic argument about moving and constructing everything outside of gravity wells seems incontrovertible to me.</td>

      <td><i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Love</i> (1981) by Raymond Carver</td>
      <td>I'm surprised to find Carver relying on punchlines - last-line narrative puns - in most of these stories. There is: a lot of rambling, a lot of meanness (breakups, fights, conversations that would be much healthier if they were honest fights), and then a transcendent or transcendently degraded last line. It would almost be not worth reading if you lost all the last lines. Here's what I mean by a pun - from 'The Calm':<br/><blockquote><i>But today I was thinking of that place, of Crescent City, and of how I was trying out a new life there with my wife, and how, in the barber's chair that morning, I had made up my mind to go. I was thinking today about the calm I felt when I closed my eyes and let the barber's fingers move through my hair, the sweetness of those fingers, the hair already starting to grow.<br/></i></blockquote>I expected him to care for his wretches.<br/><br/>The one from the wife's perspective, 'So Much Water So Close To Home' is the only standout. Completely menacing with almost no action, no flash. Good portraits of the oafish, as opposed to the rapey, as opposed to the long-suffering. I can't decide if the last line is acquiescence or perversity.<br/><br/>The title story is surprisingly slight, a 16-page Symposium with oddly inarticulate, repetitive drinkers. (One has ~10 years of college education, and but he's the most primitive.) You could put this down to naturalism and forget it entirely, but for its two great lines. (The story is, then, a fine thing for the protagonist of <i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanleaf/2015/01/04/how-birdman-betrays-raymond-carver-an-untold-story/#64e140ac742c">Birdman</a></i> to stage - self-defeating, opaque, not as deep as it wants.)<br/><br/>Stories like these live or die on dialogue, and there's neither enough heft or polish in their chat for me. I always get <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2426881729">Chandler</a> and Carver mixed up (yeah, I know) - but if I didn't, I'd go for Chandler every time. The lowness of Chandler is Gothic, stylised, and somehow less general.<br/><br/>Plus one star for SMWSCTH.</td>

      <td>Nice mission: to teach computer logic to humans to help them think. (Returning logic to its normative roots.) But Kowalski immediately strays from this to <i>also</i> try to build "<i>a comprehensive, logic-based theory of human intelligence</i>". By aiming at both pragmatic self-help and grand, metaphysical, qualitative psychology, it's too ambitious - or rather, appropriately ambitious but using the wrong tools. <br/><br/>(The right tools are unknown but probably include decision theory, statistics, distributed representations, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function">Bayesian</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding">predictive</a> brain - none of which Kowalski foregrounds. He talks about inferring causes - without using Causal Inference; about doing abduction - without probabilities; about production systems - without the more mature Predictive Processing calculus.)<br/> <br/>Kowalski praises a few bad theories, like Fodor's version of language of thought, and Gardner's multiple intelligences. (And Cyc isn't marked as a failure.) But also good theories: dual-process psychology, Sperber's relevance theory.<br/><br/>The best bit is where he links cognitive biases to naive logical rules<br/><blockquote><i>The computational interpretation [of dual process theory] is that, when an agent is deliberative, its behaviour is controlled by a high-level program, which manipulates symbols that have meaningful interpretations in the environment. But when the agent is intuitive, its behaviour is generated by a low-level program or physical device... <br/><br/>        The logical interpretation of dual process theories is that, when an agent is deliberative, its behaviour is generated by reasoning with high-level goals and beliefs. When the agent is intuitive, its behaviour is determined by low-level input‚Äìoutput associations, even if these associations can also be represented in logical form.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>    It's also a friendly introduction to more recent logics. Perhaps too friendly - if you think that formal symbols always make things harder to think about, I recommend comparing learning logic from this vs a good semiformal text like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1638937.Logic">Tomassi</a>. The bloat of English compared to symbols is about 20x, and the overheads are impossible to miss.<br/><br/>It is at least what I hoped it would be: a very clear introduction to good old "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence">GOFAI</a>" in all its rigour, grandiosity and narrowness. (There are maybe 600 definitions in this.)  I wanted a logician's (or logic programmer's) view on AI, and I got it (from the technical appendices). CL is impressive and authoritative on a small number of tasks, but it's just not generally promising, and hasn't been for a long time. This 2011 book read like a time capsule from the 1970s, before Prolog and Cyc had soured, before the Winter. (I should clarify that inductive logic programming <a href="https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11172">is a live research programme</a> - I'm going to work on it myself - but <i>only</i> in combination with the ruling statistical methods.) I actually don't understand how he can think that this approach is the answer - is it unkind to put it down to decades of sunk cost?<br/><br/>    I also thought it might be a more rigorous version of <i>Algorithms to Live By</i>, and I suppose it is, but at the cost of its practicality.</td>

      <td>Elementary philosophy of science focussing on Wheeler's "<a href="http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/3138/1/Really%20Big%20Questions.pdf">Really Big Questions</a>" about the foundations of physics, in particular the 'digital physics'. (The Questions are ‚Äò<i>How come existence</i>?‚Äô, ‚Äò<i>Why the quantum</i>?‚Äô, ‚Äò<i>It from bit?</i>‚Äô, ‚Äò<i>What makes meaning?</i>‚Äô) <br/><br/>Which wasn't what I was expecting from an out-of-print hardback tome by a serious physicist - particularly with that grand title - but still: nice. In fact it's hard to imagine anyone writing out these first steps any friendlier (ok, maybe <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/">Ben Orlin</a>). Its technical work feels effortless; think Schroedinger's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F">What is Life?</a></i> (which von Baeyer actually corrects, in passing).<br/><br/>I needed a book on the method / meta-field surrounding mathematical "information", because it has surrounded me: it threatens to encompass science. Just as "energy" eventually became a unifying pillar of all the natural sciences, information has infiltrated that same salient: <br/><br/>Energy <-> Entropy <-> Information. <br/><br/>And then into other sciences: vB hints that we should see bits as money as ML-performance as Fisher information as VNM utility, which would seize about half of theoretical science.<br/><br/>Info theory is a core part of a mathematico-philosophical witch's brew: computability, decision theory, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf">computational complexity</a>, <a href="http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/GaussianModel/JaynesProbabilityTheory.pdf">Bayesian statistics</a>, digital physics, quantum computing. Which together take big steps towards the naturalisation of logic - or, more, of maths - or more, of thought. (And is information larger than thought?) And/or the dematerialisation of physics?<br/><br/>von Baeyer builds it all up, so we get Clausius (1852) for thermodynamics, Boltzmann (1877) for entropy (inverse info) as a proper physical object, Shannon (1930) for classical info theory, Solomonoff (1960) for algorithmic complexity, Landauer for the shocking physics of computation (1961), Bekenstein (1971) and Hawking for black hole theory (crucial experiments for it-from-bit), Deutsch (1985) for how quantum computing could work. And Wheeler setting the whole new agenda. (I call it new because it hasn't made it into undergraduate philosophy, or physics, or statistics, or ordinary computer science, yet.)<br/><br/>The philosophy is very well done. I really liked his physicist's optimism about reflective equilibrium between science and folk physics:<br/><blockquote><i>Information, too, has been defined operationally. Unfortunately, this technical, bottom-up definition is very restricted, and hitherto bears little resemblence to any of the common, top-down definitions. Eventually the two definitions should converge, but that hasn't happened yet. When it does, we will finally know what information is. <br/></i></blockquote><br/>It impresses me to find a pop science book that has aged this well, over 16 years. It's sad that that's impressive - obviously I'm not reading enough physics and maths. Von Baeyer maybe leans too hard on the physics-is-solid heuristic; he ends up being uncritical about some extremely late-breaking and radical work: the heterodox classical theory of <a href="http://www.matheory.info/chapter1.html">Kahre</a> (2002) and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018820410908">Zeilinger's</a> (1999) grand quietist explanation for QM's weirdness (neither of which I've heard much about since). <br/><blockquote><i>Zeilinger's principle... furnishes an answer to Wheeler's famous question "Why the quantum?" Why does nature seems granular, discontinuous, quantized into discrete chunks like sand..? The answer is that while we have no idea how the world is really arranged, and shouldn't even ask, we </i>do<i> know that knowledge of the world is information: and since information is naturally quantized into bits, the world also appears quantized. If it didn't, we wouldn't be able to understand it. It's both as simple and as profound as that.<br/><br/>A second prediction of QM that is explained... is the randomness of the outcomes of some measurements... if the single bit of information in an elementary system is revealed, then there is no more information left over to answer additional experimental questions... so other independent measurements must have random answers.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Each chapter takes an idea ("heat and entropy", "logarithms and message space", "qubits", "Morse and optimality") and builds it up with little informal proofs and thought experiments. This is nice, but because it has to do everything from scratch it's more of a grab-bag than an argument, and certainly not a "language of science" by the end. For instance, he stops short of one key philosophical outcome of all this technical talk, which is that there are two types of explanations, even though he covers all the ideas you'd need:<br/><br/>1) information compressions (e.g. General relativity explains the force on <i>all</i> of the infinite points in spacetime in one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations#Mathematical_form">unbelievably terse tensor equation</a>. We can often count the bits used by theories like this, and so solve theory selection!)<br/><br/>2) simplified algorithms, faster ways to reason about the world (e.g. much of computer science)<br/><br/>As you can tell from the number of question marks in this review, I found this stimulating but not conclusive. But it would be foolish to expect a pop book to answer the Really Big Questions, and von Baeyer's reminds us frequently that the current answers he presents are unfinished. So this is step one of a currently unbounded algorithm. Minus a half for not quite taking things as far as they can go.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><i>Misc notes</i><br/><br/>* This would be a pretty good primer for <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality">Map and Territory</a> or <a href="">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a>, if those assume too much for you.<br/><br/>* <i>Lots</i> of literary illustrations of scientific ideas - Calvino, Wittgenstein, Borges - but it didn't feel forced to me. I suppose it might actually reduce the friendliness, for some readers.<br/><br/>* Is this true?:<br/><blockquote><i>The most important role of noise, however, is as the preserver of our sanity. Without noise, the measurement or observation of a single quantity would requite an infinite memory and an infinite amount of time - it would overload all our circuits. Neither science nor consciousness could exist... noise is a thick blanket of snow which softens the contours into large, rounded mounds we can perceive and sort out without being overwhelmed.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>We evolved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Gigerenzer#Heuristics">lots of ways</a> to ignore information. Why would this not happen again? A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye#Early_eyes">photosensitive patch</a> arises in that noiseless world; since it is an analogue processor it simply trims off the infinite information by default when it runs out of molecules or reactions(?)<br/><br/>* He calls the Bayesian interpretation of probability "the rational approach" which suits me but let's imagine that's a mistranslation of his meaning "the mental approach", "the personalist approach".<br/><br/><br/>* Gleick handles the social history and applications with unsurpassed skill, but I wanted the mind-bending crunchy side, <i>natural information</i>, digital physics, information as everything.<br/><br/>* "Information is flow of form"<br/><br/>* <a href="https://bethzero.com/2019/07/09/12-why-kolmogorov-complexity-is-useless/">Solomonoff induction is intractable</a>, another word for practically useless. Does this change the philosophical significance of the above brew? I don't think so - "Here is a way to work everything out; you can almost never use it" is a pretty plausible way for philosophy to end tbf. Does it change its scientific significance? Yes, absolutely - we have to seek approximations of the forbidden ideal or else it has none.<br/><br/>* What's fundamental, thermodynamics or information? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics">Neither</a>?<br/><br/>* Yet another way that info theory eats the life of the mind is the deeply practical "value of information", a way of deciding whether to bother with an experiment (q.v. the master, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xiojTDJP6FWdb2Fmb/value-of-information-8-examples">Gwern</a>).</td>

And a divisive book:<br/><br/>1) It is extremely focussed on men and masculine mindset - guts and brutality, mathematical facility, mind-numbing horniness, how shit works, emotional impermeability, pride in being a stereotype. (Scroll down to see reviews reacting in highly exaggerated ways to this fact, with either horror or delight.) <br/><blockquote><i>Men who believe that they are accomplishing </i>something<i> by speaking speak in a different way from men who believe that speaking is a waste of time... there might be a third category... [Waterhouse] speaks, not as a way of telling you a bunch of stuff he's already figured out, but as a way of making up a bunch of new shit as he goes along. And he always seems to be hoping that you'll join in. Which no one ever does.</i></blockquote><br/>On the wonder and absurdity of social etiquette:<blockquote><i>The room contains a few dozen living human bodies, each one a big sack of guts and fluids so highly compressed that it will squirt for a few yards when pierced. Each one is built around an armature of 206 bones connected to each other by notoriously fault-prone joints that are given to obnoxious creaking, grinding, and popping noises when they are in other than pristine condition. This structure is draped with throbbing steak, inflated with clenching air sacks, and pierced by a Gordian sewer filled with burbling acid and compressed gas and asquirt with vile enzymes and solvents produced by many dark, gamy nuggets of genetically programmed meat strung along its length. Slugs of dissolving food are forced down this sloppy labyrinth by serialized convulsions, decaying into gas, liquid, and solid matter which must all be regularly vented to the outside world lest the owner go toxic and drop dead. Spherical, gel-packed cameras swivel in mucus greased ball joints. Infinite phalanxes of cilia beat back invading particles, encapsulate them in goo for later disposal. In each body a centrally located muscle flails away at an eternal, circulating torrent of pressurized gravy. And yet, despite all of this, not one of those bodies makes a single sound during the sultan's speech.</i></blockquote><br/>Half of this is an accurate portrayal of 40s gender politics, half a defensive reaction to contemporary blank-slateism. I don't think it's a malign kind of masculinity, though there are only a couple of female characters who don't have at least peripheral or inverted sexiness - if you can't handle that I'd avoid it. A good point to bail out would be the bit where Waterhouse models the effect of masturbation vs sex on his cognition as a periodic timeseries.

Totally factitious understanding dawns on the woman‚Äôs face, and her eyes ping bosswards. The boss, still deeply absorbed in an article about the next generation of high-speed routers, shoves out his lower lip and nods, like every other nineties American male who senses that knowing this stuff is now as intrinsic to maleness as changing flat tires was to Dad. "I hear that‚Äôs really exciting now," the woman says in a completely different tone of voice, and begins scooping Randy‚Äôs stuff together into a big pile so that he can repack it. Suddenly the spell is broken, Randy is a member in good standing of American society again, having cheerfully endured this process of being ritually goosed by the Government.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>2) It is also a partisan in the Arts vs STEM "culture war". (In fact Stephenson is often dismissive of all academia - "<i>grad students existed not to learn things but to relieve the tenured faculty members of tiresome burdens such as educating people and doing research</i>".) One of the most important scenes in the book shows a lone techie clashing with a self-appointed jury of stereotypically appalling critical theorists: they speak nonsense about an objective matter, he correctly calls them on it, they cover him in ad hominem bulverism until he gives in. It's not without nuance: his champion in the fight Randy is later shown sulking and reliving it and admitting his own pettiness:<br/><blockquote><i>‚ÄúI strenuously object to being labeled and pigeonholed and stereotyped as a technocrat,‚Äù Randy said, deliberately using oppressed-person‚Äôs language maybe in an attempt to turn their weapons against them but more likely (he thinks, lying in bed at three A.M. in the Manila Hotel) out of an uncontrollable urge to be a prick.</i></blockquote> <br/><br/>3) There are a lot of coincidences, much more than the novelistic baseline. Characters meet Atanasoff and Turing and Reagan and MacArthur. (A Nazi submarine captain makes a sneering reference to a bureaucratic nightmare being something out of "that Jew Kafka". I thought this was an absurd anachronism, but looking into it, the Nazi could easily have read him, but could not have made the reference to a Brit and expected it to stick. English translation of <i>Das Schloss</i> in 1930 but it didn't take off until after the war.) This is cute/trite on its own, but I find it helpful to imagine Stephenson looking down at history, selecting a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Littlewood">particularly interesting sub-graph</a> from the population<br/><br/>4) There are lots of info-dumps. Large sections of this are indistiguishable from nonfiction. ("<i>This pause is called the horizontal retrace interval. Another one will occur...</i>") People seem to hate this, but it is fine since it's done through aspie characters who absolutely do talk like that.<br/><br/>5) It has a lot of pulpy Feats, fuck-yeah setpieces which fiction this good usually foregoes.     Tropical headhunters; escape from a collapsing mineshaft; cryptocurrency in the 90s; tactical blackface; drinking and lolling with your Nazi captors; etc.<br/><blockquote><i>It would be an idyllic tropical paradise of not for the malaria, the insects, the constant diarrhea and resulting hemorrhoids, and the fact that the people are dirty and smell bad and deat each other and use human heads for decoration.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>It's easy to miss the uniting theme, and thus call it "not a novel" or whatever, because it only unmasks on p.791. It is Ares v Athena, rage v cunning, politics v engineering, normies v geeks, law v ethics, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/">conflict v mistake</a>, local maxima v the search for the global. This overloaded binary is embodied in Andrew v Randy, the Dentist v Avi, Rudy v G√∂ring, All of Japan v Dengo.<br/><br/>Now, it suits me to have litigious bastards and culture-warriors be the inheritors of Ares, of mindless destruction. But it would be silly to think that the stakes are comparable between the plot strands: it's WWII vs the Struggles of Some Cool Crypto Entrepreneurs. But Stephenson is obviously not equating them, and might be pointing out that stakes are now in general lower, even when you're up against contemporary gangsters.<br/><br/>Another giant theme is the emergence of one new masculinity, beyond the taciturn physical hero: the geek. This is the "third category" above. (Is this really that new? Isn't it just the Scholar?)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><i>Misc notes</i><br/><br/>* Waterhouse seems to be taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Tutte">Bill Tutte</a>'s space in history and seizing it for America but ok.<br/><br/>* Bobby Shaftoe is the noblest junkie character I've ever seen - ingenious in his pursuit of morphine, but slightly more keen on Marine honour than on it.<br/><br/>* I was not expecting Stephenson to use <i>converting to Christianity</i> as the symbol for Dengo leaving sick ultranationalism behind. Compassion and liberalism are far larger and better than the Christian launchpad they happened to use, after all.<br/><br/>* Relatedly there's his preference for cute family-values Christianity over postmodern critical theory:<br/><blockquote><i>To translate it into UNIX system administration terms (Randy‚Äôs fundamental metaphor for just about everything), the post-modern, politically correct atheists were like people who had suddenly found themselves in charge of a big and unfathomably complex computer system (viz, society) with no documentation or instructions of any kind, and so whose only way to keep the thing running was to invent and enforce certain rules with a kind of neo-Puritanical rigor, because they were at a loss to deal with any deviations from what they saw as the norm. Whereas people who were wired into a church were like UNIX system administrators who, while they might not understand everything, at least had some documentation, some FAQs and How-tos and README files, providing some guidance on what to do when things got out of whack. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>* Some surprisingly deft notes on kink and the exogenous/preconscious nature of sexuality, in the bit where they're spying on Tom Howard.<br/><br/>* This line accurately portrays the mindset of certain wizard types like Turing:<br/><blockquote><i>It is exciting to discover electrons and figure out the equations that govern their movement; it is boring to use those principles to design electric can openers.</i></blockquote><br/>though it is discreditable and nongeneralisable to hold.<br/><br/>* I learned a lot of words. <br/><br/>* There are dozens and dozens of depictions of Japanese war crimes before we get any note paid to the horrendous suffering of the Japanese troops. But after that it is suitably even-handed in its tragedy. One of the saddest sentences I've ever read: "They are strafing the survivors".<br/><br/>* Root is a tech determinist about the war - the Allies won because their tech was better, end-of. I seriously doubt historians would go with this. <br/><br/>* <spoiler>I struggle to fit Root into the world. His death and reappearance is the only magical element in the entire thing (coincidences aside), and clashes with the main bloody theme. I am toying with the idea that Root is a collective name like James Bond, but I suppose it'll just be some switcheroo bullshit.</spoiler><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>There's a lot wrong with it - it's about twice as long as it needs to be, the gender stuff is overdone, it is intentionally annoying to its outgroup, succumbing to 'conflict theory', and none of its antagonists (Loeb, the Dentist, Wing, Crocodile) are fleshed out <i>despite him having 900 pages of opportunities for fleshing them</i> -  but it's grand, clever, full of ideas, funny, full of great setpieces, and foresaw a couple of things about our decade.</td>

      <td>Good example of the most distinctive literary trend of the day: web serial fiction / wiki fiction. Also of the shortcomings of same: the committee fragmentariness and unmanageable hugeness. (I cut this short at page 1000. And this is only one of three giant ebooks of the whole wiki. Phew.)<br/><br/>That's the medium. Its genre is post-pulp post-Lovecraft urban fantasy-horror - the most popular genre? (Aside from old stalwarts, trash romance and MFA lit.) And style's the uncommon pseudoacademic register of Lovecraft's original pulp. <br/><br/>Its achievement is to dispense with characterisation and rely entirely on atmosphere and startling concepts. There's no protagonist and only hints of antagonists (besides the thousands of SCP objects themselves). <br/><br/>The Foundation is ludicrously powerful - they've global jurisdiction over law enforcement, run hundreds of fatal human experiments, retain a vast staff and holdings. In order for this to work as horror, they need equally elevated foes - and so they do: they're always being infiltrated, manipulated, stolen from, exsanguinated or bombed. The Foundation commits many atrocities (contrast <i>Delta Green, Dresden Files, Agents of Shield, the X-Files</i>, which are much more anti-authority).<br/><br/>It has all the ordinary kinds of horror - monsters, disease, body horror, mind-rape, invisible forces, alien geometries - but also the greater, rare horror of <i>exponentiation</i>, of facing a foe with the potential to suddenly explode beyond all containment and never stop growing. Another distinctive bit is its <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-048">meta</a> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-049">horror</a>: objects which know the rules of the story and about other objects.<br/><br/>I recommend reading this with the images disabled.

      <td>Thoughtful and lucid nontechnical essays on the very different structures hiding behind the vague anticoncept 'capitalism'. The title alone beats most leftists and rightists, who tend to tacitly deny the existence of good or bad capitalisms, respectively. (Where by good we mean "good for growth and eliminating poverty".) The authors go further of course, with four ideal types:<br/><br/>* <i>state-guided capitalism</i> (China, 60s Japan, Singapore)<br/>* <i>big-firm capitalism</i> (South Korea, Japan, France, North Carolina)<br/>* <i>entrepreneurial capitalism</i> - high growth from small companies doing actually new things, high distribution of gains - (Ireland, UK, California)<br/>* <i>oligarchic capitalism</i> - low growth, low distribution of gains - (Russia, Italy, sometimes South Korea)<br/><br/>They tie these to specific policies, often lacking in these kinds of books. They also accept that what's "good" economic policy depends on your existing base (cf. Ha-Joon Chang's argument for trade barriers for pre-industrial countries). Most of the book is about the conditions and effects of entrepreneurship, but they also find big firms actually necessary ("<i>the best form of capitalism is a blend of entrepreneurial and big-firm</i>"), well before <a href="https://read.macmillan.com/lp/big-business-by-tyler-cowen/">Tyler Cowen</a>.<br/><br/>Decent paean to the moral importance of growth too:<br/><blockquote><i>slow growth, especially when coupled with widening inequality, can provide an environment that breeds distrust and often hate. It is not an accident that some of the worst periods of intolerance to African Americans and immigrants in United States history (the late 1800s, the 1930s, 1970s) occurred during periods of slow or negative growth. The worst-case example of this was, of course, the rise of Nazism...<br/><br/>Michael Mandel: 'Such technology-driven growth is essential if we are not to drown in our own problems... Without breakthroughs in medical science, it won't be possible to supply the healthh care to a generation of aging Americans without bankrupting the young. Without breakthroughs in energy production, it won't be possible to bring Third World economies up to industrialised living standards without badly damaging the environment...' <i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>If annual growth of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 100 years average<br/>labor productivity is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earnings will have risen<br><br/>2%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 620%<br/>3% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1820%<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Good book for anyone who thinks they hate economics, or economists, or neoclassical economics, or growth itself. Certainly much more readable and fair than Piketty's mega-bestseller. (For very adversarial people, better to start with <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filthy_Lucre:_Economics_for_People_Who_Hate_Capitalism">Filthy Lucre</a></i>, which analyses good and bad forms of competition.)</td>

Each character has an obsession - the booze mage gets charges from drinking rare liquors, the wealth mage from squandering money, the skater mage from risky stunts, the porn mage from..., the self-harm mage from... This isn't trivial: to get the serious charges you have to permanently change your character. The spells in the book are just suggestions, the characters mostly have to make them up.

But don‚Äôt you push us so far because this is aggravated harassment<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Maybe-girlfriend's own register is a little tiring, bright and arch and digressive (but not enough to keep the  the pall of her surroundings lifted). It might be an attempt to balance out the setting with comically out-of-place lyricism, but if so it works strangely:<br/><blockquote><i>'But understand, daughter,‚Äô went on ma, ‚ÄòI'm not saying my rear cannot now fit in the chair because the chair's become too tight for it. It can still fit in. It‚Äôs just that now it encompasses a certain amount of extra inches or fractions of inches to which it has never acclimatised and which in the old days didn‚Äôt used to be.'<br/>'I knew now, of course, what she was driving at, though unsure still how to respond.... My response therefore, should be comparable to her own words, should be of like tone and weight in order to acknowledge and to respect her older status, even her originality indelineating the depth of her rear condition in relation to the chair she was speaking of.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>The Community hates the depressed and the upbeat ("shiny"), the chaste and the promiscuous, the deviation:<br/><blockquote><i>And that was the trouble with the shiny people. Take a whole group of individuals who weren‚Äôt shiny, maybe a whole community, a whole nation, or maybe just a statelet immersed long-term on the physical and energetic planes in the dark mental energies; conditioned too, through years of personal and communal suffering, to be overladen with heaviness and grief and fear and anger ‚Äì well, these people could not, not at the drop of a hat, be open to any bright shining button of a person stepping into their environment and shining upon them just like that... <br/><br/>As for the environment, that too, would object, backing up the pessimism of its people, which was what happened where I lived where the whole place always seemed to be in the dark. It was as if the electric lights were turned off, always turned off, even though dusk was over so they should have been turned on yet nobody was turning them on and nobody noticed either, they weren‚Äôt on...<br/><br/>So shiny was bad, and 'too sad' was bad, and 'too joyous' was bad, which meant you had to go around not being anything; also not thinking, least not at top level, which was why everybody kept their private thoughts safe and sound in the recesses underneath.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>I quite liked the purely-functional names - "maybe-boyfriend", "third-brother-in-law", "longest friend from primary school", "Somebody McSomebody", though I see it's not a popular methodology on here. I think "Milkman" is the only proper name in it. <br/><br/>She belabours a good metaphor (the sunset from the front cover): even the colour of a beautiful sunset is an ideological matter, for these locals. They've a particular cached thought - "the sky is blue" - and refuse to let a fancy intellectual (a spirited French teacher) make them notice that the sky is currently anything but blue. Blatant wilful error in the face of decisive evidence, maintained to express one's identity: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics">welcome to the species</a>.<br/><br/>Reviewers call it funny, which it isn't really until Chapter Seven, until Milkman is gone and the <i>Carry On</i>-Tarantino part can kick off. There's <a href="https://youtu.be/9BVKdy7BXBE?t=73">this</a>:<br/><blockquote><i>Before Milkman, they had shot a binman, twobusdrivers, a road sweeper, a real milkman who was our milkman, then another person whodidn‚Äôt have any blue-collar or service-industry connections ‚Äì all in mistake for Milkman. Thenthey shot Milkman. Then they played down the mistaken shootings while playing up theintended shooting, as if it had been Milkman and only Milkman they had shot all along.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>and<br/><blockquote><i>"You‚Äôre a female. He‚Äôs a male. You‚Äôre my sister-in-law and I don‚Äôt care how many of his family got murdered, he‚Äôs a bastard and would‚Äôve been a bastard even if they hadn‚Äôt got murdered." They hadn‚Äôt got murdered. Only four had got murdered. The other two had been a suicide and an accidental death.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Very tiring but worthy overall.</td>

      <td>A fun, nasty, bitchy taxonomy of social class / psychological theory of the firm; a mishmash of economics, psychoanalysis and literary criticism; a series of massive blogposts apologising for being a book. <br/><br/>It splits employed people into three classes with terrible names - Leaders ("Sociopaths"), Loyalists ("Clueless"), Workers ("Losers") - and throws a massive amount of fictional evidence at each. That's obviously a formal hierarchy, Leaders > Loyalists > Workers, but Rao's first big left turn is to impose a second contradictory ordering on the 3 classes in developmental psychology terms: Clueless < Losers < Sociopaths. I like his subdivision of Losers into: Minimum-effort rationally-disengaged; Overperformers; future Sociopaths. It looks nasty, and Rao is uninterested in making it seem moral or immoral, but if this is how the leaders actually think, Rao is doing us (the 99%) a service. <br/><br/>Is this system justified and true? No. Rao writes the best clickbait in the world, what he calls "insight porn".    It is the verbal equivalent of the noise an F1 engine makes on a 200m straight. The class theory in this would make for a great literary theory, a blueprint for future <i>Office Space</i>s. Myers-Briggs is marginally better than the dumb view of people as more or less defective versions of one character. So too is this better than "bosses/workers" cod Marxism. <br/><br/>(He could have massively increased his audience and reduced unwanted connotations by renaming "Losers" to "Workers" <br/><blockquote><i>        the Loser ‚Äî really not a loser at all if you think about it ‚Äî pays his dues, does not ask for much, and finds meaning in his life elsewhere<br/></i></blockquote>)<br/><br/>He has a weird relationship with the amoral elites - he often says things like<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    In the big games of life, those involving the Darwinian dimensions of sex, money or power, we don‚Äôt get to define the rules. And it is only those games that can create social value.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>putting destiny and ultimate value in their hands. And he clearly thinks of himself as a post-reality-shock enlightened figure. And yet he rags on the inauthenticity, nihilism, cruelty, hollowness of his 'Sociopaths'.<br/><br/>There are dozens of acute, contentious, boggling passages like<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    For high-empathy people, all this is natural. By participating in collective feeling in groups of any size, and reacting to basic attraction/aversion drives, you can actually safely navigate all the complexity by instinct.<br/>    Not only can you do this, you will actually feel good doing this. This feeling is called happiness. I don‚Äôt have time to go into this, but happiness is entirely a social phenomenon, and there‚Äôs plenty of evidence that the best way (and from my reading, the only way) to get happy is to get sociable. Non-social feelings that seem like happiness turn out, upon further examination, to be distinct emotions like contentment, equanimity or hedonistic pleasure<br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i><br/>    the level of abstraction that we are concerned with, all theories of developmental psychology ‚Äì Freud‚Äôs, Piaget‚Äôs, Erikson‚Äôs, Maslow‚Äôs ‚Äì say roughly the same thing about arrested development: you are born Clueless and clue up in fits and starts. Bits of you get stuck and left behind at different points, and eventually you exhaust your capacity for real change and stall (though you may retain an illusion that you are on a path of ‚Äúlifelong growth and learning,‚Äù itself a pattern of arrested development)<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>I can imagine a teenager reading this and becoming absolutely insufferable.

      <td>Kinda amateurish prose, everything "classic" and "legendary" in the same sentence.<br/>    <br/>    It's saved by the singular, remarkable character Carmack. Neuroatypical, ascetic, principled, focussed to the point of dissociation. He slept on the floor for months, despite being rich, because he didn't see the need for comfort. An excellent example of what someone profoundly creative can do, if they also love work. (: All the glories of the species.)<br/><br/>    Romero is less interesting, because he is a fairly ordinary tech startup founder (with a sicker sense of humour and less self-suppression), mendacious and loud. "<i>To the outside world, Romero was id.</i>"        He may have invented gaming smack talk, by screaming at people in LAN tournaments.  If you've never been on Xbox Live, you probably haven't had a 9 year-old child scream that you're a faggot and a noob. The child is channeling Romero.<br/><br/>I concede that there would have been no Doom Moment without Romero's hyping it - that together these two men form one functioning human being.<br/><br/>    Kushner occasionally adds value, e.g. when he notes that id were to gaming what technical metal was to music: the marriage of virtuosity with extreme content, "<i>high technology and gruesome gameplay</i>". To see how important skill is in selling a dark aesthetic, compare the Learjet-level success of fancy metal with the parochial subsistence of hardcore punk. <br/><br/>He also sees an entire type very clearly: the alpha nerd, with all his lofty contempt, Ferraris, workaholism, disloyalty, pranks, energy.

Some readers feel tricked - feel that Harris is smuggling in science under soft, false pretences. This isn't fair; he has done this stuff for decades, visited lamas in Tibet, put in the work. It's implausible that he would do so much insincerely; whatever his other failings, he is actually trying to bridge the two kinds of seekers.* (That said, this book design is a masterpiece of camouflage. Look at the soft colours, the sunny logo, the sans-serif purity, the unthreatening subtitle. Compare his other books!)<br/><br/>However: consider all the things people mean by "spirituality":<br/>1. subjective knowledge of ultimate / immaterial reality<br/>1b. gaining supernatural abilities as a result<br/>2. one's deep moral or existential values<br/>3. personal growth<br/>4. feeling of awe-inspiring beauty<br/>5. introspection; close contact with one's own "inner dimension"<br/>6. "the ability to step a little back from your emotions and thoughts, observe them as they are without getting swept up in them, and then evaluating them critically"<br/>7. sense of love towards (all) others<br/>8. the quest to see the ego and the self as illusory<br/><br/>With so much popular support - with so much baggage - it's not possible to throw out the word or concept; instead we have to try and reform it. This is Harris' mission - though in fact he focusses almost exclusively on (5) -> (8), the standard Buddhist therapy of not being hurt by distraction, bad luck, frustrated desires. <br/><br/>He rejects (1) straightforwardly, in favour of psychologising the whole practice. Paraphrased: 'Instead of making you experience Reality, meditation lets you experience your mind; instead of strengthening your insubstantial soul, you're strengthening your mind.' This is a healthy kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_reconstruction">reconstruction</a> in my view, but it certainly leads him to make controversial claims like "<i>The deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self</i>". Metaphysically profligate readers will have no fun here. (But they knew that already.)<br/><br/>How can a scientist (or at least a pro-science talking head) boost a practice with the aim of rejecting <i>thought</i>? The trick is to distinguish thinking / experiencing (which are after all the locus of all value, and of decisions and creativity) from <i>identifying</i> with the stream of your thoughts, from being carried away, from being endlessly distracted. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/><i>Does this stuff work?</i> It <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818837">probably does</a> for stress reduction - at least like taking a nap does, or a valium, or sitting still and breathing deeply for a bit. And on the other end, it is definitely not the source of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_energy">supernatural brain-juice-drinking power</a>. So the truth is somewhere between these two limits, and we drift, deciding whether to spend time on it.<br/><br/>I'm an unpromising practitioner. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_proliferation">this</a> is kind of my jam. It's not the indescribability that bothers me - after all, any knowledge-how is indescribable (or rather describable only with <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/205757/neural-network-how-are-number-of-parameters-calculated">millions of parameters</a>). You can accept e.g. Hume or Parfit's reasoning - you can have the propositional knowledge, can <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/01/knowing-that-versus-knowing-how/">know that</a> "there is no self beyond my bundle of experiences". Meditation is supposed to be the know-how of nonessentialism, the skill of actually paying attention to the implications of this System-2 judgment.<br/><br/>But being 'nonconceptual' means no language, no premises, no reason, no jokes, no connection, no comparison, using none of my strengths, leaving none of my spoor. This is a great loss to me.<br/><br/>I don't know that I do suffer as a result of identifying with my thoughts; I don't think that dissatisfaction lurks in every sensation I ever experience or also my whole life in retrospect. But the old claim, similar to Marxist or feminist 'false consciousness', is that I am too owned to realise I'm being owned:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>"beginning meditators... report after days or weeks of intensive practice that their attention is carried away by thought every few seconds. This is actually progress. It takes a certain degree of concentration to even notice how distracted you are."<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Freedom from desire sounds much like death to me, for all that Harris and others argue that it can somehow coexist with passion against the suffering of others, with striving to be a better person, with chipping in to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=I+hereby+renounce+the+right+to+complacency%2C+and+vow+lifelong+to+take+only+what+minimum+of+leisure+is+necessary+to+my+productivity%2C+viewing+health%2C+happiness%2C+rest%2C+and+play+as+means%2C+not+ends%2C+and+that%2C+while+Utopia+provides+my+needs%2C+I+will+commit+the+full+produce+of+my+labors+to+our+collective+effort+to+redirect+the+path+of+human+life+away+from+death+and+towards+the+stars.&oq=I+hereby+renounce+the+right+to+complacency%2C+and+vow+lifelong+to+take+only+what+minimum+of+leisure+is+necessary+to+my+productivity%2C+viewing+health%2C+happiness%2C+rest%2C+and+play+as+means%2C+not+ends%2C+and+that%2C+while+Utopia+provides+my+needs%2C+I+will+commit+the+full+produce+of+my+labors+to+our+collective+effort+to+redirect+the+path+of+human+life+away+from+death+and+towards+the+stars">Great Project</a> of discovery, compassion, optimisation. Luckily the two projects - really feeling that you are not your thoughts, not a homunculus behind your eyes having them; vs not wanting things because wanting leads to disappointment - seem to be separable.<br/><br/>A consolation: there's a sense in which meditation, introspection and phenomenology are highly, maximally empirical - they involve very close attention and analysis of the raw data. It just happens that the raw data (the sense-data) are irreplicable, private, closed, and so not directly a matter for science. Empiricism before science, consciousness without self. And I like this. <br/><br/>Mindfulness is billed as not just cool and true but <i>useful</i> - <br/><blockquote><i>    No doubt many distinct mechanisms are involved - the regulation of attention and behaviour, increased body awareness, inhibition of negative emotions, reframing of experience, changes in your view of the 'self', and so forth - and each of these will have their own neurophysiological basis."<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Well, I do love self-regulation!<br/><br/>The following argument isn't explicitly stated by Harris, but I find it helpful as an existence-proof for the usefulness of nonessentialism:<br/>1. We are happy and perform well when we're in 'flow' states.<br/>2. Flow states involve "losing" yourself in a task, in a concrete, unhesitating sequence of perceptions and actions.<br/>3. Therefore losing yourself can be good and helpful.<br/><br/>Also<br/><br/>1. We do not directly apprehend the external world; we know it through sense-data plus massive computational modelling tricks in the brain.<br/>2. We know that the brain computes the wrong thing sometimes. (Cognitive biases, optical illusions, top-down processing, hallucinations.)<br/>3. So, if such a thing is possible, it could be helpful to attend to sense-data more closely, to rule out automatic-brain errors.<br/><br/>While I don't have a very clear philosophy of mind, I know I'm not a direct realist or substance dualist or identity essentialist, so I've no simple philosophical objections to breaking down the Self, either. Allons-y.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Even if I accept that mindfulness is a source of value, there's presumably still a tradeoff against clearer, quicker, more public sources: doing science or kindnesses or pleasures. <a href="https://www.uk.dhamma.org/courses/10-day-courses/">10 days spent in myself</a> is 10 days not learning, not exercising, not enjoying, not helping, not meeting, in solitary. (And even on the contemplative axis it competes with Stoicism, with yoga, with writing, with psychedelics.)<br/><br/><br/><i>How much work will it be?</i> Some contemplatives freely admit that the cost is very high: some contemplatives are not just salesmen. I met someone who claimed to be capital-e-enlightened. (He was otherwise articulate and modest.) He said it took 6 years' work, at many hours a week. I asked him if he could say how valuable it is in other terms - 'What else has been as good?' He said: a decade of intense psychotherapy, or two philosophy degrees. (<a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.22.0.than.html">One ancient text</a> teases us by setting 'seven years' as the required period, but in true troll-Buddhist style it then slowly walks back this helpful definite statement.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>On that note: I was looking forward to writing a gotcha paradox here, but Harris (and thousands of years of arhats and yogis) pre-empted me:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>...the deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self -[but] to seek such freedom, as though it were a future state to be attained through effort, is to reinforce the chains of one's apparent bondage in each moment.<br/><br/>One [solution] is to simply ignore the paradox and adopt various techniques of meditation in the hope that a breakthrough will occur. Some people appear to succeed at this, but many fail... Goal-oriented modes of practice have the virtue of being easily taught, because a person can begin them without having had any fundamental insight...<br/><br/>...The other traditional response is... to concede that all efforts are doomed, because the urge to attain self-transcedence or any other mystical experience is a symptom of the very disease we want to cure. There is nothing to do but give up the search.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm not actually worried by this, because I suspect the full-Buddhist anti-striving thing is unnecessary and... undesirable.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><br/>Why should an evolved creature have the power to inspect its own sense-data? If we are constantly distracting ourselves with reified thoughts, what evolutionary role did this play? At the top of this review is Harris' droll diss about people deluding themselves into thinking they are meditating - but how <i>can</i> we know that we, or anyone, is not deluded? (Brain scans of inhibited medial PFCs are interesting but merely suggestive.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Most of the above isn't directly from Harris, I'm riffing off <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha">better</a> <a href="https://flightfromperfection.com/mindfulness-striving.html">rationalist</a> reconstructions of this ancient one-weird-trick. (I actually don't know if this is any good, cos I don't know the area. Seems fine.)<br/><br/><br/>* Much of their anger is about his chapter warning of the history of abuse by gurus and yogis and so on. But like it or not this is a public service.</td>

I'm fascinated by Bezos making each team come up with their own <a href="http://www.andreweifler.com/fitness-functions/">objective function</a> - but apparently this is also hated, on "digging our own grave" grounds.

      <td>His last book: a half-rational vehicle for his late contrarian mystical worldview; in fact it reads as his making amends for the vivid bioconservative paranoia of <i>Brave New World</i>. It certainly handles the same themes, simply inverted in their consequences: we see drugs as <i>enablers</i> of enlightenment; a much healthier view of suffering, as a pointless trap; a surprisingly pragmatic view of genetic engineering; and a very balanced view of civilisation and economic development. <br/><br/>So: he constructs a Taoist-Hindu-Buddhist utopia which mostly avoids primitivism and annoying mysticism for a sustainable East plus West non-industrial modernity. It's not my idea of paradise, but other people's utopias usually aren't. Moreover, it is a <i>doomed</i> utopia nestled in nasty 1950s international political economy. The animating enemy of <i>Island</i> is not the authoritarian consequences of technology, but what Scott Alexander <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">calls Moloch</a>: the forces of self-fulfilling inevitability and destructive competition.<br/><br/>Protagonist is a mirror of John the Savage: an open-minded liar and shill, a fallen outsider who manages to undermine the utopia he infiltrates. Huxley himself is the model for him: in fact we can see Will's journey from cynical aestheticism to materialist spirituality as autobiography in allegory. The mystic character, Rani, is amazing: an enraging theosophical flake. This reflects well on Huxley's own weirdness: the Rani is as far from traditional organised religion as Huxley is from her.<br/><br/>Given the times and his project, lots of Huxley's worldview have <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">become clich√©s</a>: e.g. ‚Äúyou forget to pay attention to what's happening. And that's the same as not being here and now ‚Äù. The prose is arch and syrupy but I like it. (<i>BNW</i> is saddled by the air of a smug jeremiad. <i>Island</i> is every bit as didactic but nowhere near as smug.) It's chock-full of bad poetry though. I love his use of reported speech to denote characters he disrespects: this saves him the bother of writing it and us the bother  of reading and makes a conspiracy of us and Huxley: <br/><blockquote><br/>\t<i>He turned to Will and treated him to a long and flowery farewell. <br/><br/><br><i>In polysyllables, Mr Bahu hedged diplomatically. On the one hand, yes; but on  the other hand, no. From one point of view, white; but from a different angle, distinctly black.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Pala's structure is cool but not at all radical enough to solve what is wrong with us, I think ‚Äì technology is controlled very carefully and considered one of the 'dozens' of fronts to aid people on. (Hypnotherapy and tantra are given way more credit than they deserve, for instance.) Is ‚Äúone-third‚Äù of suffering intrinsic? I look forward to science seeing if that is the case. I elect Huxley into the hall of fame of people who make a very popular error and later recant to no acclaim.

And the prose is just serviceable. Title sucks too. <br/><br/>But it blooms: the long evolutionary pathway it follows - from a spider jeeust 'thinking' that pack hunting might be a good idea, to a full manned space program - is excellent. The alternative technological route is the great bit - what would industry look like without fossil fuel, a mechanised society without metal? - and the protagonist spiders who find the route are easy to empathise with. <br/><br/>Ants are used as robots, factories, laboratories, and eventually as CPUs:<br/><blockquote><i>There are hundreds of tamed ant colonies within Great Nest, not counting those in the surrounds that undertake the day-to-day business of producing food, clearing ground or fending off incursions of wild species. Each colony has been carefully trained, by subtle manipulation of punishment, reward and chemical stimulus, to perform a specific service, giving the great minds access to a curious kind of difference engine.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>{over-literal bull-shit}<br/>(Tchaikovsky overstates massively the potential of ants as a processing channel, though - witness the giant leap in practicality from ~1cm mechanical relays to (even the crappiest) fully-electronic vacuum-tube. Nothing so slow and large as an ant colony could carry out much logic-gate work without taking much longer than a human-level worker and anyway accumulating huge errors.)<br/>\{/over-literal bull-shit}<br/><br/> (Their bioengineering stuff is actually more realistic than Vinge's spiders' breakneck 50-year sprint through the C20th and C21st centuries, even if you include the Uplifting virus. This is because Vinge's telling is deterministic - they discover all the same stuff as us, in mostly the same order - and their culture a cartoon of ours.) <br/><br/>His other successful theme is incomprehension: females not understanding male liberation, spiders not understanding how a depressed solitary human could be sentient, Kern not understanding anything. (Mostly the spider gender politics are boring, just <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutionFlip">bizarro patriarchy</a> with a cannibal twist.)<br/><br/>The main antagonist, the mad hubristic scientist starts off dull and strawish (why did it take 300 years for her to ask what rough genus the spiders were?) but the moment she stops that stuff and reaches across the species barrier is quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Also, Tchaikovsky often drops out of the Spiders' worldview mid-sentence to telegraph what you, a human, should be thinking of all this (an example is the use of "curious" in the passage above). <br/><br/>The humans are less interesting, fairly stock generation-shippers. There is this inversion, that the scholar of dead languages is Key Crew, plot-critical all the time:<br/><blockquote><i>To study and laud those antique psychopaths during the Earth's last toxic days had seemed bad taste. Nobody liked a classicist.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Anyway worthwhile, momentarily dazzling.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>How does it do as Serious science fiction?<br/><br/><i>Social development</i>: Lots. The spiders' matriarchal anarchism is shown with realistic downsides. The ark ship humans go through several revolutions and regressions.<br/><br/><i>Software development</i>: Some, but all pretty high-level.

This one avoids all these things and is radical in an unconventional way.*<br/><br/>It's hard to know what to think of Thiel. He's easy to demonise - much easier than his loudmouth peer Musk. For instance, he's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship">anti-college</a>, anti-affirmative-action, anti-Clinton - and even openly anti-competition! (And <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/29604-parabiosis-peter-thiel-blood">a vampire</a>!)<br/><br/>But I've been impressed with his clarity and sense of proportion <a href="https://www.weltwoche.ch/ausgaben/2018-29/artikel/en-hypnotische-massenphanomene-die-weltwoche-ausgabe-29-2018.html">in</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/patrissimo/status/1026803467279581184">interviews</a>, and nowhere here did I find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard">Girardian</a> anti-humanist conservatism that Gawker, Vulture, Vox, (...) made me expect. <br/><br/>For instance, this spiel moves me every time I hear it - the billions of hours we steal from children every year:<br/><blockquote><i>We teach every young person the same subjects in the same ways, irrespective of individual talents and preferences. Students who don‚Äôt learn best by sitting at a desk are made to feel somehow inferior, while children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up defining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality.<br/><br/>And it gets worse as students ascend to higher levels of the tournament. Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking. For the privilege of bring turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation. Why are we doing this to ourselves?<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>and similarly plaintive and humane bits:<br/><blockquote><i>Why work with a group of people who don‚Äôt even like each other? Many seem to think it‚Äôs a sacrifice necessary for making money. But taking a merely professional view of the workplace, in which free agents check in and out on a transactional basis, is worse than cold: it‚Äôs not even rational. Since time is your most valuable asset, it‚Äôs odd to spend it working with people who don‚Äôt envision any long-term future together. If you can‚Äôt count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work, you haven‚Äôt invested your time well‚Äîeven in purely financial terms. <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>He is simply not simple. There are four positive references to Marx, four to Zuckerberg; two to Shakespeare, two to Bezos. He is a revisionist, then, intolerable to one side and oddly scathing about the other. (The chapter which translates Google's public rhetoric is not complimentary, for instance.) His niche seems to be <i>the repugnant but true</i>. So, like Taleb without the bluster and boasting. Which feels bizarre, like I'm in a different timeline where Taleb is actually aiming to not alienate a mass audience.<br/><br/>He says true things about things I know about: the history of economic thought (Walras did indeed lift the formalism of general equilibrium from physics) and the deadened air of contemporary Political Philosophy. His contribution to Trump's campaign was risible and maybe a defection against the world - but notice that <i>even this lapse</i> speaks to his ability to find unexpected truths - <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/">FiveThirtyEight gave</a> an 80% chance of a Clinton win at that point. So maybe his analysis and helpful checklist for startups are true too.<br/><br/>It's a shame few critics of capitalism will read this - for he is one, in his way:<br/><blockquote><i>Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines. Actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition, all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: If you want to create and capture lasting value, don‚Äôt build an undifferentiated commodity business.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>(Of <i>actually-existing</i> capitalism I mean.)<br/><br/><br/>How on earth can you argue that monopolies give more social utility than high competition? First, distinguish three kinds: 1) criminal saboteurs and antitrustees (Apple); 2) government-licenced pets (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_US_dealership_disputes">US car dealers</a>, the East India Companies); and 3) "creative monopolies" who gain their massive market share by doing something much, much better than everyone else. Obviously only the latter is good for society. <br/><br/>I was recently rushing to the airport, and pulled the quickest route (via underground via train via foot) from Google Maps. On the way, I noticed a sign in the Tube and realised that actually a different line was a much shorter route. So I walked 10 mins to that line, to find, of course, that it was suspended all weekend and, consequently, that Google is better at my life than I am. This is what he means.<br/><br/><br/>He goes further and says that the spare resources and vision of a creative monopoly is <i>the</i> source of innovation and so<br/><blockquote><i><br/>Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>The model is structurally the same as the old one about the Agrarian revolution: farms meant that for the first time, not everyone had to work full-time on food production, which let them specialise in other roles (war, gods, justice, lore) and eventually - slowly - invent new things.<br/><br/>Even so, I thought of an alternative road to dynamism, given perfect competition and so no profits: competition leads to low prices, which leads to savings, which are pooled into investment funds, which give entrepreneurs the same kind of space (and potentially the long view) that profits do.<br/><br/>Other people would not use the word "monopoly", trying to manage the connotations, trying to persuade us by smoothing things over. This is not Thiel's strategy.<br/><br/>One chapter argues that "<i>Success is not just luck</i>", mostly on the back of the existence of serially successful entrepreneurs (it is plausible that once could be luck, and plausible that one success brings massive funding, deserved or not. It isn't plausible that someone could dumbly blunder into 3 billion-dollar executions, even given the easy ride for the second and third). It pains me slightly to admit the latter, because it tints <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2521302674?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">my otherwise complete loathing of Steve Jobs</a>.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>Misc notes</b><br/><br/>* He notes that the term "developed nations" is a sign of our lack of ambition, of a premature, smug, quasi-willed halt.<br/><br/>* The dot-com boom was even crazier than you thought:<br/><blockquote><i>A South Korean firm wired us $5 million without first negotiating a deal or signing any documents. When I tried to return the money, they wouldn't tell me where to send it.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>* It is not yet clear whether killing Gawker was good or bad. Either way, like his Trump donation, you must acknowledge the sheer gall and direction.<br/><br/>* One should do a Straussian (between-the-lines) reading of anyone smart, conservative and public, because there will be a lot that's unsayable. I don't care to.<br/><blockquote><i>The few who knew what could be learned, <br/>Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show, <br/>reveal their feelings to the crowd below? <br/>These we have always crucified and burned.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>* Actually hold on. The man's a transhumanist, an anti-school radical, a funder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading#The_Seasteading_Institute">one of our only</a> large-scale experiments in urban planning or libertarianism, a rationalist. Why do we call him a conservative? <br/><br/>---<br/><br/><br/>Short, original, modest, and he credits his ghostwriter on the cover. Minus one point because it makes 200 large claims in 200 pages and has no citations for anything.<br/><br/><br><br/><br/>* Thinking about it, it's not so much that he avoids cliche, as that the erudite context defangs them.<br/>"Zero to One" sounds like the usual kind of motivational crap, except that it's actually a good illustration of his maxim of creative monopoly ("0 -> 1 is much, much better than 1 -> n"). And the subtitle "How to build the future" is not figurative and not petty: he cites Bostrom's trajectories about the ultimate fate of the universe - and is only focussed on technology because that's what will get us past the Rise and Fall trap, the stagnation trap and the extinction trap.</td>

This undermines his claim that inequality is now as bad as it was in the early 1900s: when tax codes change dramatically, as they did through the pre-war period and in 1986, the data become unrepresentative (without adjustment). After adjustment, it looks like inequality fell much less in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion">postwar boom</a> and has risen much less, post-80s.<br/>* <a href="http://mattrognlie.com/piketty_diminishing_returns.pdf">Rognlie</a> and <a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/spowpecon/info_3ahdl_3a2441_2f30nstiku669glbr66l6n7mc2oq.htm">Bonnet et al</a>: Piketty calculated the increase in capital share wrong, it's a lot lower; price appreciation (benefiting the rich) is not general, instead driven by housing. This mostly benefits single-home-owners, who use their capital by living in it, and so aren't 'rentiers'; thus Piketty is mostly wrong about the rise of rentier capitalism. Also, housing shortages are often political rather than fundamental, which again undermines the big anti-capital policy implication. <br/>* <a href="http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/teaching/FurmanOrszag15.pdf">Furman and Orszag</a>: Piketty's explanation for extreme income disparities (: large increases in corporate-executive bargaining power) isn't right; instead only a small group of monopolistic tech firms ("superstars") display this.  <br/>* <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/files/11348">Acemoglu and Robinson</a>: The evidence is mostly strongly against his three fundamental laws of capitalism. Most importantly, the elasticity of substitution of capital for labour is less than one; therefore, Piketty's main mechanism for explaining inequality cannot be true.<br/>* <a href="http://www.deirdremccloskey.org/docs/pdf/PikettyReviewEssay.pdf">McCloskey</a>: lots of errors.<br/><br/>Piketty's core claims:<blockquote><br/>1. the capital share of national income has risen (at the expense of labour share).<br/>2. <i>r > g</i>; wealth generally grows faster than economic output.<br/>3. whenever <i>r > g</i>, inequality will rise because capital gets concentrated in fewer hands. <br/>3b. <i>r</i> (the return to capital) won't change much in response to a decline in growth rate, because the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is high.<br/>4. The capital-output ratio will be worse in the future.<br/>5. Therefore large wealth tax now, or both capitalism and democracy will die. <br/></blockquote><br/>The above research finds that the first is true in some places (in the UK, the US and Canada?), but each of the middle three is questionable. (4) could happen but we're not given much reason to think it inevitable. Summary: Piketty's data collection and descriptive work is mostly good, his analysis and modelling is flawed enough to undo his policy recommendations (5).<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>The resentful econ undergrad in me thrilled to see Piketty saying this:<br/> <blockquote><i>To put it bluntly, the discipline of economics has yet to get over its childish passion for mathematics and for purely theoretical and often highly ideological speculation, at the expense of historical research and collaboration with the other social sciences. Economists are all too often preoccupied with petty mathematical problems of interest only to themselves. This obsession with mathematics is an easy way of acquiring the appearance of scientificity without having to answer the far more complex questions posed by the world we live in. There is one great advantage of being an academic economist in France: here, economists are not highly respected in the academic and intellectual world or by political and financial elites. Hence they must set aside their contempt for other disciplines and their absurd claim to greater scientific legitimacy, despite the fact that they know almost nothing about anything.</i></blockquote> <br/><br/> He's keen to emphasise his ideological hygiene, that he's a real-deal empiricist. Weighed down by overstatement of its own achievement (‚Äúthe fundamental laws of capitalism‚Äù). <br/><br/>With a few more diagrams and boxed definitions, this would make an excellent intro macro textbook, gentle and empirically obsessive as it is. Lot of redundancy - whoa-there steady-now summary paragraphs every few pages - but I suppose that's what you need to do if you aim to be understood by policymakers.</td>

From his enormously influential, fallacious dismissal of intelligence research in general and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/science/14skull.html?_r=1">Morton in particular</a>, to his dishonest coup of public discourse over punctuated equilibrium (pushing the flashy and revolutionary version in literary magazines, retreating to minimal and uncontentious forms in the science journals who could actually evaluate it), he muddied the waters even as he brandished real literary talent and noble political intentions. This is unforgiveable: empirical clarity is too rare and precious to sacrifice so. <br/><br/>Maynard Smith: <i><blockquote>Gould occupies a rather curious position, particularly on his side of the Atlantic. Because of the excellence of his essays, he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the preeminent evolutionary theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists. All this would not matter, were it not that he is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory.</i></blockquote><br/><a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/evolute.html">Krugman</a>:<br/><i><blockquote>Gould is the John Kenneth Galbraith of his subject. That is, he is a wonderful writer who is beloved by literary intellectuals and lionized by the media because he does not use algebra or difficult jargon. Unfortunately, it appears that he avoids these sins not because he has transcended his colleagues but because he does does not seem to understand what they have to say; and his own descriptions of what the field is about - not just the answers, but even the questions - are consistently misleading. His impressive literary and historical erudition makes his work seem profound to most readers, but informed readers eventually conclude that there's no there there.</i></blockquote><br/>Tooby and Cosmides:<br/><i><blockquote>We suggest that the best way to grasp the nature of Gould's writings is to recognize them as one of the most formidable bodies of fiction to be produced in recent American letters. Gould brilliantly works a number of literary devices to construct a fictional "Gould" as the protagonist of his essays and to construct a world of "evolutionary biology" every bit as imaginary and plausible as Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. Most of the elements of Gould's writing make no sense if they are interpreted as an honest attempt to communicate about science (e.g., why would he characterize so many researchers as saying the opposite of what they actually do) but come sharply into focus when understood as necessary components of a world constructed for the fictional "Gould" to have heroic fantasy adventures in...<br/><br/> "Gould" the protagonist is a much loved character who reveals himself to be learned, subtle, open-minded, tolerant, funny, gracious to his opponents, a tireless adversary of cultural prejudice, able to swim upstream against popular opinion with unflinching moral courage, able to pierce the surface appearances that capture others, and indeed to be not only the most brilliant innovator in biology since Darwin, but more importantly to be the voice of humane reason against the forces of ignorance, passion, incuriousity, and injustice. The author Gould, not least because he labors to beguile his audience into confusing his fictional targets with actual people and fields, is sadly none of these things.<br/><br/>Yet in the final analysis, there are genuine grounds for hope in the immense and enduring popularity of Gould. Gould is popular, we think, because readers see in "Gould" the embodiment of humane reason, the best aspirations of the scientific impulse. It is this "Gould" that we will continue to honor, and, who, indeed, would fight to bring the illumination that modern evolutionary science can offer into wider use. </i></blockquote><br/>Here is a fictional leaf from Gould's <i>ad hominem</i> book, to give you a sense of what he does, at his worst:<br/><blockquote><i>Gould is famed for the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which holds that adaption and speciation is not generally a slow, gradual process measurable in tens of thousands of year periods, but instead a rapid response to environmental shocks, measurable in hundred-year periods. The political bias of this theory is too blatant to ignore: as a Marxist, Gould requires that sustainable change be possible by revolution rather than by long accumulation (...)</i></blockquote><br/>(For full effect I should now chide him for his genic panadaptationism.)<br/><br/>Along with Lewontin and Rose, Gould mediated a huge contradiction in our culture: they allowed the C20th left to feel we were scientific, in our comfortable blank-slatism. That we had already incorporated the deep challenge of evolutionary biology - since these eminent men told us it had no human implications. <br/><br/>Read Gould for fun and uplift, but take great care, for he cares about other things more than truth. (Read Midgley and Singer first if the politics scare you; they might stop you fleeing into Gould's dodgy arms.)<br/><br/>From James. The Leonardo and Columbus esays are 4/5.</li><br/></td>

Not least, she wrote <a href="http://www.philosophica.ugent.be/fulltexts/76-4.pdf">this</a>, maybe the brassiest passage I've ever seen in an academic journal:<br/><blockquote><i>if Descartes had written a Preface to the </i>Meditations<i> that was truthful, faithful to his firmest convictions, and philosophically consistent, the relevant section would have gone something like this:<br/><blockquote><br/>I cannot demonstrate the immortality of the human soul, and probably no philosopher can. Immortality is not logically impossible, but it wouldn‚Äôt be what you are probably imagining it to be either. Perception, like sensation and emotion, is a registering by our minds of occurrences in our nerves and brain. If our minds endure after death, therefore, as far as the philosopher can tell, they will feel neither pain, nor pleasure, for they will no longerform a composite with our bodies. We will no longer see colours, touch objects, and hear sounds. We will not remember events ofour past lives. We will be numb and inert. Animals will be, as both Aristotle and Lucretius thought, nothing after death, and wehumans will be almost nothing - at most capable of imageless thought and intellectual memory. Of course, we can hope for more than this. Perhaps our bodies will be resurrected and reattached to our minds, so that we are restored to awareness of a world. But this is a matter of faith and cannot be philosophically demonstrated, whereas more important truths such as the excellence of our minds and bodies can be philosophically demonstrated. <br/><br/>Be that as it may, we are not mere animals. Our language and rationality indicate that we are specially favoured by God. As to whether animals are conscious, I do not know. I avoid speculative philosophy. But everyone can appreciate that animalscannot carry on a conversation, and I seriously doubt that animals reason, for I can show how their behaviour is mediated by the brain to which their sensory organs report, without ascribing reasoning to them. <br/><br/>The Fathers of the Church were wrong to scorn the human body asa source of moral corruption and to suggest that it is a shell that we will happily cast off. We use the cerebral representations it forms for purposes as exalted as mathematics, and if we could not understand and trust proofs about the triangle, how should we understand and feel confident about proofs about invisible objects such as God?...Admire God, who has given you a world to study, as well as to experience, and a mind equipped with language and reasoning powers, but leave off worrying about eternal rewards and punishments. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Of course Descartes could not have published such a Preface, not in France and not under his own name.

(Half the book is his confessing to childhood theft, psychosis, academic failure, and petty vendettas.) Rather than getting to the bottom of ESP, or morgellons, or homeopathy, or past-life regression, Storr tries to understand the character of the people who believe and disbelieve in them.<br/><br/>Besides confronting unusual beliefs without (as much) prejudice, <i>The Heretics</i> is about coming to terms with the fact that we are all riddled with deep obstacles to objectivity: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups">ingroupism</a> and confirmation bias; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_and_indirect_realism">representation realism</a>; emotional reasoning; the terrifyingly unreliable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_memory">reconstructive</a> nature of memory; the sad <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rationality-versus-intelligence?barrier=accessreg">nonidentity of intelligence and rationality</a>; evolutionarily adaptive delusions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias">superiority</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089.2016.1219030">agency</a>.

They operate with the machinery of prejudice and distortion. Their purpose is not fact but propaganda. The scientific method is the tool that humans have developed to break the dominion of the narrative. It has been designed specifically to dissolve anecdote, to strip out emotion and leave only unpolluted data. It is a new kind of language, a modern sorcery, and it has gifted our species incredible powers. We can eradicate plagues, extend our lives by decades, build rockets and fly through space. But we can hardly be surprised if some feel an instinctive hostility towards it, for it is fundamentally inhuman.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Storr is seriously out of his depth on the science: he is always at least second-hand from the evidence (when interviewing researchers), and often third-hand (most of his citations are pop science books), and so several chapters suffer from journalism's classic problem, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ">false balance</a>. The reason this isn't a call to shut the book is because he doesn't spare himself, states this repeatedly - and this is in fact <i>the theme</i> of his book: that almost all of us are unable to infer the truth about a shocking diversity of things.*<br/><br/>For instance, not just the past-life cranks, but also the Skeptics he encounters are out of their depth, and deserve the calling-out they get from him. No one can think they're past the need for doubt.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>I am surprised, for a start, that so few of these disciples of empirical evidence seem to be familiar with the scientific literature on the subject that impassions them so. I am suspicious, too, about the real source of their rage. If they are motivated, as they frequently insist, by altruistic concern over the dangers of supernatural belief, why don't they obsess over jihadist Muslims, homophobic Christians or racist Jewish settlers? Why this focus on stage psychics, ghosthunters and alt-med hippies?<br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>During our conversation, I asked Randi if he has ever, in his life, changed his position on anything due to an examination of the evidence. After a long silence, he said, 'That's a good question. I have had a few surprises along the way that got my attention rather sharply.' <br/>&nbsp; 'What were these?' I asked. <br/>He thought again, for some time. 'Oh, some magic trick that I decided on the modus operandi.'...<br/>'So you‚Äôve never been wrong about anything significant?'<br/>'In regard to the Skeptical movement and my work...' There was another stretched and chewing pause. He conferred with his partner, to see if he had any ideas. 'No. Nothing occurs to me at the moment.'<br/></i></blockquote><br/>That's not how memory works though, is it? <br/><br/>Even given his unusual humility, Storr is too literal-minded and prosecutorial ("<i>I have been looking for evidence that James Randi is a liar</i>"). Storr is disillusioned with particular Skeptics, and reacts by throwing out scepticism:<br/><blockquote><i> For many Skeptics, evidence-based truth has been sacralised. It has caused them to become irrational in their judgements of the motives of those with whom they do not agree...<br/>This monoculture we would have, if the hard rationalists had their way, would be a deathly thing. So bring on the psychics, bring on the alien abductees, bring on the two John Lennons ‚Äì bring on a hundred of them. Christians or no, there will be tribalism. Televangelists or no, there will be scoundrels. It is not religion or fake mystics that create these problems, it is being human. Where there is illegality or racial hatred, call the police. Where there is psychosis, call Professor Richard Bentall. Where there is misinformation, bring learning. But where there is just ordinary madness, we should celebrate. Eccentricity is our gift to one another. It is the riches of our species. To be mistaken is not a sin. Wrongness is a human right.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>And when Randi corrects himself in the course of a sentence ("<i>I didn't go to grade school at all, I went to the first few grades of grade school</i>"), Storr leaps on this as a serious contradiction rather than just the patchy nature of speech. Sure, he talks about his emotional bias against scepticism - but he still leaves in this idiot journo behaviour, the uncharitable coaxing out of flaws.<br/><br/>These chapters were a good ethnography of '<a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Traditional_rationality">traditional</a>' <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WeQv9LSCj9nYXoTwJ/what-is-wrong-with-traditional-rationality">(nontechnical) rationality</a>. But Storr doesn't know about the other kind (which both foregrounds and copes with all the cognitive biases he is so struck and scarred by), and so his conclusion about rationalism is completely awry.**<br/><br/>The title is fitting in a few ways: Storr sees these people as persecuted underdogs (he likes many of the quacks and fringeists, and so focusses on the arrogance and bias of the - however correct - mainstream figures dealing with them); and they certainly have the holy madness of people who cry out despite knowing they will be ostracised. <br/><blockquote><i>Over the last few months, John E Mack has become a kind of hero to me. Despite his earlier caution, he ended up believing in amazing things: intergalactic space travel and terrifying encounters in alien craft that travelled seamlessly through nonphysical dimensions. And when his bosses tried to silence him, he hired a lawyer. He fought back against the dean and his dreary minions. He battled hard in the name of craziness...<br/></i></blockquote><br/>David Irving is interesting in this regard: he does not act like a fraud (e.g. he sues people for libel, even though this brings intensive scrutiny of his research), but rather a sort of compulsive masochist-contrarian. Stranger still, his (beloved) family were all solid anti-Nazi soldiers in WWII. (Storr contorts himself to explain Irving's identification with Hitler as due to their sharing an admiration of the British forces (...)) <br/><br/>Storr's awful experience on a Vipassana retreat is a vivid example of the Buddhist <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/the-dark-knight-of-the-souls/372766/">dark night of the soul</a>. We don't know what fraction of people suffer terribly from meditation, but despite its <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/23/1064082990875.html">cuddly image</a>, there's surely large overlap with the <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254610/WHO-MSD-MER-2017.2-eng.pdf;jsessionid=C7A88D6AF4B91BEB0EBF7EA1A65E2671?sequence=1">8% of people</a> who are clinically depressive and/or anxious.<br/><br/>The chapter on psi does not represent <a href="http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/2011/WagenmakersEtAl2011_JPSP.pdf">the state</a> <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033423">of evidence</a> <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/01/06/that_silly_esp/">properly</a> - perhaps because one of his proof-readers was <a href="https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/06/daryl-bem-proved-esp-is-real-showed-science-is-broken.html">Professor Daryl Bloody Bem</a>. ***<br/><br/>The ending is stirring but tilts over into relativism:<br/><blockquote><i>The Skeptic tells the story of Randi the hero; the psychic of Randi the devil. We all make these unconscious plot decisions...<br/><br/>We are all creatures of illusion. We are made out of stories. From the heretics to the Skeptics, we are all lost in our own secret worlds. <br/></i></blockquote><br/>But the question is to what <i>degree</i>! And the degree of lostness, of inverse rationality, varies by many orders of whatever magnitude you wish to pick.<br/><br/>Storr's disquiet at the sheer power of cognitive bias, and the systematic failures of yes/no science (that is: statistical significance rather than effect size estimation) is well and good.  (<a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2017/06/29/lets-stop-talking-published-research-findings-true-false/">Gelman</a>: <br/><blockquote><i>I think ‚Äòthe probability that a model or a hypothesis is true‚Äô is generally a meaningless statement except as noted in certain narrow albeit important examples.</i></blockquote>.) <br/>And his humane approach is certainly bound to be more compelling to mystics and flakes than e.g. deGrasse Tyson's smug dismissals. But Storr is scared of grey, of the fact that doubt is only reducible and not eliminable. This is because he doesn't know anything about our most beautiful weapons: probabilism, Bayesian inference, Analysis. <br/><br/>I recommend <i><a href="http://elephantinthebrain.com/">Elephant in the Brain</a></i> or <i><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/">Rationality from A to Z</a></i> instead as an approach to the vital, dreadful side of cognition (including advice on avoiding being a fake, partial, traditional sceptic); they have less angst and false equivalences, and were written by people who understand the balance of evidence. <br/><br/>Actually that's too strong; I am frustrated with Storr because he is so similar to me, except he doesn't grasp that the technical is the path out of (many) biases. There's a lot wrong with it and you should probably read it, and how often can one say that?<br/><br/><br><br/>* Storr is right that skeptics can lack compassion. The "Morgellons" people <i>are</i> victims regardless of what their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology">etiology</a> turns out to be (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusional_parasitosis">mental illness</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formication">nerve disorders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithonyssus_bacoti">tropical rat mites</a>, or yes malicious sentient fibres). At minimum, they are victims of bad fortune plus rigid and actually unscientific medical practices. The Lesswrong style of rationalist has less of this problem IMO (more emotional literacy; a more Californian culture).<br/><br/>** Storr:<br/><blockquote><i>    I am concerned that I have overstated my argument. In my haste to write my own coherent story, I have barely acknowledged the obvious truth that minds do sometimes change. People find faith and they lose it. Mystics become Skeptics. Politicians cross the floor. I wonder why this happens. Is it when the reality of what is actually happening in our lives overpowers the myth that we make of themselves? Are we simply pursuing ever more glorious hero missions?...<br/><br/>This is an imperfect system, as it relies on many secondary sources. Moreover, I do not declare myself to be free of the biases that afflict any writer, and I'm certainly not immune to making mistakes. If any errors are noted, or if new findings supersede claims made in the text, I would be very grateful to receive notification via willstorr.com, so future editions can be corrected.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/><br/>*** Important caveat to the headline of that linked article from Gelman:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>The only thing I don‚Äôt like about Engber‚Äôs article is its title, ‚ÄúDaryl Bem Proved ESP Is Real. Which means science is broken.‚Äù I understand that ‚ÄúDaryl Bem Proved ESP Is Real‚Äù is kind of a joke, but to me this is a bit too close to the original reporting on Bem, back in 2011, where people kept saying that Bem‚Äôs study was high quality, state-of-the-art psychology, etc. Actually, Bem‚Äôs study was crap.

The cyberspace is pretty good (better than <i>Hyperion</i> or <i>Snow Crash</i> or <i>Neuromancer</i> because less neat). <br/><blockquote><i>The mist was the world was the data corpus was the Crypto-sphere was the history of the world was the future of the world was the guardian of un-done things was the summation of intel¬≠ligent purpose was chaos was pure thought was the untouched was the utterly corrupted was the end and the beginning was the exiled and the resiled, was the creature and the machine was the life and the inanimate was the evil and the good was the hate and the love was the compassion and the indifference was everything and nothing and nothing and nothing.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>One virtuoso passage, on the species' trajectory after a nebula occludes the sun:<br/><blockquote><i>so humanity left the surface of the world to the ice, wind and snow, and sheltered, reduced and impoverished, within the stony depths of the planet's skin,  finally coming to resemble nothing more than parasites in the cooling pelt of some huge dying animal.<br/><br/>With it it took all its knowledge of the universe and all the memories of its achievements and all the coded information defining the animals and plants that had survived the vicissitudes of time and evolution and - especially - the pressure of the human species' own until then remorseless rise.<br/><br/>Those buried citadels became whole small worlds of refugee communities and spawned still smaller worlds as new machines took over the job of maintaining the levels of the crypt, until gradually more and more of what was in any sense humanity came to reside not simply in the created world of its tunnels, caverns and shafts but within those worlds in the generated realities produced by its computers...<br/><br/>Still, what was left of humanity persisted, retreating further from the open oven of the surface until it became trapped between it and the heat of the planet's own molten sub-surface.  It was then that the species finally gave up the struggle to remain in macrohuman form, pulling back fully into a virtual environment and resorted to storing its ancient biochemical inheritance as information only, in the hope that one day such fragile concoctions of water and minerals could exist again upon the face of the Earth.<br/><br/>Its time from then was long as people reckoned it from that point, short as they would have before.  The sun's photosphere continued to expand until it swallowed Venus, and Earth did not survive much longer; the last humans on Earth perished together in a crumbling machine core as its cooling circuits failed, the half-finished life-boat spaceship they had been attempting to construct already melted to a hollow husk beside them.<br/><br/>He suffered with each child abandoned to the snow; with every old man or woman left - too exhausted to shiver any more - under piles of ice-hard rags; with all the people swept away by the howling, fire-storm winds; with each consciousness extinguished - its ordered information reduced to random meaninglessness - by the increasing heat.<br/><br/>And he woke from such dreams sometimes wondering whether all that he was being shown could possibly be true, and on other occasions so convinced that it had been real that he would have faithfully believed what he had seen was the inescapable future, rather than some mere possibility, projection or warning.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Problems: <br/>* Climaxes about 2/3 through. I suppose that's okay, it's not a three-act play.<br/>* Bascule is hooked into the king's brain surveillance network, but regularly escapes the king's secret police.<br/>* Banks shows the crypt people having <a href="http://ageofem.com/">Em</a> accelerated cognition (about 1000x), but without Ems dominating the economy and society. (Actually, no human besides the military, scientists and secret police are heard of doing any real work, so maybe this is the case in the background.) <br/>* It's set on Earth, which is odd for Banks, but this fact isn't used much. Some of us stayed behind.<br/>* There are several virtual worlds in this (the bird crypt, the transport map, the interrogation allegories, the deep crypt with its garden) but they're insufficiently different from each other and base reality (all have a kind of fairytale logic, all have mythical beasts stalking around).<br/>* None of the sheer stakes, grandeur, and philosophical tension of the Culture books.<br/>* Fun but a mere sketch.</td>

The war is there, the terrible firestorms, the terrible hunger; but nothing of the cult (a <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-zen-ideas-that-propelled-japan-s-young-kamikaze-pilots">death cult</a>, king cult, Prussia cult, and race cult) that caused them. There is a little bit of Edo totalitarianism (a lord having a maiden burned alive to render a painting of hell more realistic) at least. <br/><br/>That said, one of the great achievements of 'American Hijiki' is to show how resentment and insularity can come from other sources than <i>hibakusha</i> trauma or psychotic Imperial pique. <br/><blockquote><i>no Japanese can understand it, probably, if he's not my age. No Japanese who can have an ordinary conversation with an American, who can go to America and have Americans all around him without going crazy, who can see an American enter his field of vision and feel no need to brace himself, who can speak English without embarrassment, who condemns Americans, who applauds Americans, no Japanese like this can understand... what I have is an incurable disease, the Great American Allergy.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>The allure and/or horror of Western things (booze, books, bodies) features in maybe half of these.

But Akutagawa does that better. In general I didn't see much correlation between eminence and quality (though this judgment is from behind that thick screen, translation).<br/><br/>Only one piece, 'Same as Always' (about harming your child) stands for Japan's powerful, distinctive kind of horror.<br/><br/>The Hiroshima piece is surprisingly flat, journalistic. I've cried at exhibits about the bombs before, so it ain't me.<br/><br/><br/>I liked Murakami's introduction, where he admits hostility to, and ignorance of, modern Japanese fiction:<br/><blockquote><i> for a long while I was convinced that, with a few exceptions, early modern and contemporary Japanese literature was simply boring. There were many reasons for this, but foremost among them may be that the novels and stories we were assigned to read in school were pretty bad.

Good-bye, and for the young scholar here who saved your fine red life, SHALOM and God bless."<br/>Savage, all of it, savage.</i></blockquote><br/>Like any psychologically ambitious work of the mid-C20th, it has a lot of Freud in it, much of it going unchallenged.

      <td>Comic novella about raping famous men for money. So, one of the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction#Timeline">real person slashfics</a> in history. Actually scandalous; one can only imagine the ruckus if it was published today.<br/><br/>The eponymous rogue teams up with a livestock scientist and a beautiful accomplice ("<i>Yasmin Howcomely, a girl absolutely soaked in sex</i>") to date-rape the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Uncle_Oswald#Victims_of_Oswald.27s_plot_.28in_order_of_appearance_in_the_book.29">great men</a> of early C20th Europe. Then blackmail them, and steal their semen to sell off. Drugging Freud, Monet and Proust with a psychotic aphrodisiac, the three conspirators collect a Nobel sperm bank. Most of the men are disposed of in one pithy paragraph, with only comic details supplied. <br/><br/>It's scandalous because of its levity. The plot has more in common with <em>A Serbian Film </em>than <em>Carry On</em>, yet it keeps up the latter's matey banter. At one point Yasmin comes across Picasso, who promptly rapes and dismisses her, without need of the "Sudanese blister beetle" drug. Needless to say, this is tremendous sport:<br/><blockquote><i>"Do you know what he did afterwards?" Yasmin said. "He just buttoned up his trousers and said, ‚ÄòThank you, mademoiselle. That was very refreshing. Now I must get back to my work.‚Äô And he turned away, Oswald! He just turned away and started painting again!"<br/>"He‚Äôs Spanish," I said, "like Alfonso." I stepped out of the car and cranked the starting handle and when I got back in again, Yasmin was tidying her hair in the car mirror. <br/>"I hate to say it,‚Äù she said, "but I rather enjoyed that one."<br/>"Tell me," I said, "is Monsieur Picasso a genius?"<br/>"Yes," she said, "it was very strong. He shall be wildly famous one day."<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>The sexual prowess of the drugged men is a means for Oswald to reflect on their overall quality. (The volume they produce is shorthand for his esteem of them, e.g.: "<i>Fifty straws from Kipling.</i>") It leaves Dahl room to propound a general ranking of the giant personalities of the eC20th. For instance, Einstein and Freud are able to resist their inverted rape for some minutes, earning both respect and suspicion. And of Freud:<br/><blockquote><i>"You should have seen his face, Oswald. You really should have seen it. The Beetle was hitting him and the sexcrazy glint was coming into h</span></span><span style="color: #783f04; font-family: inherit;">is eyes and he was beginning to flap his arms like an old crow. But I‚Äôll say this for him. He didn‚Äôt jump me right away. He held off for at least a minute or so while he tried to analyze what the hell was happening. He looked down at his trousers. Then he looked up at me... He was really very decent about it all. As soon as he‚Äôd had his first explosion... he jumped away and ran back to his desk stark naked and began writing notes. He must be terrifically strong-minded. Great intellectual curiosity."<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>The low point comes in the treatment of Shaw, by this stage a celibate disabled old man. They drug him three times the dose and:<br/><blockquote><i>"Who is there?" shouted a voice from behind the hut. It was a male voice, but high-pitched and almost squeaky. Oh God, I though, the man is a eunuch after all...<br/><br/>[after]... I heard a yell from the garden and in the half-darkness I saw this tall, ghostlike, whitebearded figure charging down upon us stark naked and yelling, "Come back, you strumpet! I haven‚Äôt finished with you yet!"<br/><br/>I saw Mr. Shaw capering about on the sidewalk under the gaslight, white-skinned all over save for a pair of socks on his feet, bearded above and bearded below as well, with his massive pink member protruding like a sawn-off shotgun from the lower beard. It was a sight I shall not readily forget, this mighty and supercilious playwright who had always mocked the passions of the flesh, himself impaled now upon the sword of lust</span>..."<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>He is made into a real man - no more humourless vegetarian prude. Sad and standard in "one of [Dahl's] lightest comic works".<br/><br/>Oswald is not Dahl; some of Oswald's opinions of his victims are cartoonishly snobbish; its <a href="https://readysteadyno.blogspot.com/2010/02/propos-of-lady-chatterleys-lover-dh.html">idiotic, Lawrentian theory</a> of virility is only used because it is very funny; and Oswald receives a brutal comeuppance for exploiting Yasmin that it's implied he never recovers from. <br/><br/>A dazzling and ridiculous book, and as far as I can tell it evaded all opprobrium because it was published in the gap between the sexual revolution and the rise of PC. From the above you already know if you should avoid it.</td>

'The blade itself' is from Homer - a rare moment where he recriminates about war.

Her friend applying makeup is<br/><blockquote><i>a seamed and folded imitation of a magazine picture that is itself an imitation of a woman who is also an imitation, the original nowhere, hairless lobed angel in the same heaven where God is a circle, captive princess in someone's head. She is locked in, she isn't allowed to eat or shit or cry or give birth, nothing goes in, nothing comes out. She takes her clothes off or puts them on, paper doll wardrobe, she copulates under strobe lights with the man's torso while his brain watches from its glassed-in control cubicle at the other end of the room, her face twists into poses of exultation and total abandonment, that is all. </i></blockquote><br/>The anti-Americanism of the (Canadian) protagonists - so venomous it actually deserves the full title racism - is funny. It hides behind deep-ecology and Romantic critique: <blockquote><i>It doesn‚Äôt matter what country they‚Äôre from, my head said, they‚Äôre still Americans, they‚Äôre what‚Äôs in store for us, what we are turning into. They spread themselves like a virus...  Second-hand American was spreading over him in patches, like mange or lichen.

I wanted there to be a machine that could make them vanish, a button I could press that would evaporate them without disturbing anything else, that way there would be more room for the animals, they would be rescued<br/></i></blockquote><br/>David (a rapey leftist idiot) is anti-Yank from the start, but the narrator eventually sinks into a similar kind of hallucinatory environmentalist racism, as part of her rejection of 'the city' and the modern world.<br/><br/>It's unclear why her friends are her friends, since they are trivial and cruel, as she is (initially) not. There's maybe one sympathetic character in the whole book, a taciturn Quebecois handyman who doesn't symbolise much of anything, as far as I can see (not the city, sure, but neither her mystical primitive).<br/><br/>The narrator is full of non sequiturs like "<i>If you tell your children God doesn‚Äôt exist they will be forced to believe you are the god</i>", little anti-rational digs which never go challenged. Just because both revolution (David) and the status quo ("Americans"), men and women, are awful, doesn't mean that nature is any better.<br/><br/>She starts off with strong run-on stream of consciousness - <blockquote><i>I slide my tongue around the ice cream, trying to concentrate on it, they put seaweed in it now, but I'm starting to shake, why is the road different, he shouldn‚Äôt have allowed them to do it, I want to turn around and go back to the city and never find out what happened to him. I‚Äôll start crying, that would be horrible, none of them would know what to do and neither would I. I bite down into the cone and I can‚Äôt feel anything for a minute but the knife-hard pain up the side of my face. Anaesthesia, that‚Äôs one technique: if it hurts invent a different pain. I‚Äôm all right.</i></blockquote> - but apparently forgets this sentence structure about halfway through.<br/><br/>Oddly, it's sort of mirror of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Dream_(novel)">An American Dream</a></i>: the same atavism, same disgust with modernity, but with violence suffered rather than gleefully inflicted.<br/><br/><i>Surfacing</i> gets called 'important'. I suppose because of the affectless, doubting-feminist agency of a divorcee angle; I hope it isn't because people think the protagonist had an admirable spiritual journey when really she's driven insane by mistreatment and boredom.</td>

The result determined whether your life was an abusive wreck, or hey pretty ok. <br/><br/>(At the time, to get a divorce you needed 1) to put up with it for three years, 2) to then blow the annual salary of 5 people (¬£200 then, ~¬£100,000 in today's money) bringing a fucking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrimonial_Causes_Act_1857#Background">private Act of Parliament</a>; 3) to publicly and credibly state your husband's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_England_and_Wales#History">incest, sodomy, bigamy, or desertion</a>" (not his adultery) and maybe also deal with MPs leering at your sex life. <br/><br/>Oh, and no remarriage ever, i.e. no socially acceptable relationships ever again.)<br/><br/>All this makes the book <i>about</i> something important, rather than important (or readable) itself. And Austen hardly covers this grimdark aspect.

All the events come to us filtered through a ignoble narrator representing the standard 'enlightened' view of the time: <i>sure the Romanovs are evil, but for God's sake don't say so</i>. <br/><br/>Lots to admire, in the slow, tense pace - nothing really happens in the present, it's all uncovered in letters - or in his handling of Timo's idealism/insanity. This prison scene made me laugh, on the tube:<br/><blockquote><i>'Timo - are you really sure it was the Czar?'<br/>"I wasn't sure at first. He was wearing a short black cloak with a hood covering his head. I couldn't open my eyes and look straight at him, because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Then I recognized him with certainty, in the light... he stepped back from my cot, and ‚Äì just imagine this! ‚Äì knelt down on the floor that was covered with rat droppings ‚Äì I watched him through my eyelashes ‚Äì and began to pray ‚Äì two feet away from my ear! I could hear every word he whispered: <br/><br/>'... I beseech Thee, Lord, make him see reason and make him apologize to his Sovereign for his unimaginable words ‚Äî so that I might forgive him and become free of the burden it is to me to keep him im¬≠prisoned...‚Äô He closed his eyes and said, as if to himself: ‚ÄòBut if Thou hast decided otherwise, I say like Thy son said to Thee at Gethsemane: Father, I pray to Thee ‚Äî but let Thy will be done, not mine. ‚Äô And then, Jakob ‚Äî then he lowered his head and opened his eyes, and looked straight into mine...<br/>‚ÄúWell. Two words was all we exchanged. He whispered:<br/>'...Timothee?!'<br/>And I said, '</i>Tartuffe!<i>'<br/><br/>‚ÄúHe covered his ears with his palms and ran out of the casemate, in rather an unimperial fashion. And I haven‚Äôt seen him since.‚Äù Timo cleared his throat and added, sounding somewhat self-deprecating: ‚ÄúAt least not awake, that is...‚Äù<br/>I said, ‚ÄúTimo, this story ‚Äî surely it was only a dream?‚Äù<br/>Timo had walked over to the far corner of the room where the<br/>shadows cast by the sconce mirrors combined to create near¬≠<br/>darkness. He stood there, almost invisible; even the glow of the<br/>pipe he was holding had gone out. Then he laughed and said: <br/>‚ÄúWell ‚Äî whatever you think best... ‚Äù<br/></i></blockquote><br/>But Kross is clumsy in inserting an enchanting peasant as Timo's wife; everyone who knows her is a complete Eeva fanboy, rhapsodising. But it's not clear why; she's brave and catty but otherwise pretty indistinct. There's definitely an undercurrent of promoting Estonian accomplishments here - not many of Timo and Eeva's grand and broad virtues are attested in the evidence, which makes them <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary</a> and <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu">Marty</a> Sue in Kross' fanfiction - but it strikes me that this is not just chauvinism, given Kross' context. Consider: an Estonian living under Russian totalitarianism writes about an Estonian speaking out against Russian totalitarianism.<br/><br/>I resent Kross for the M. Night Shymalan ending, a bit, though it is possible that I should be resenting the narrator's fantasies of it instead.</td>

It must be harder to believe in serene mathematical beauties when you have dirty hands.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Grad student maxims:<br/><blockquote><i>Mother nature is a bitch.<br/>The probability of a given event is inversely proportional to its desirability.<br/>One fudged curve is worth a thousand weasel words.<br/>No analysis is a complete failure - it can always serve as a bad example;<br/>Experience varies directly with the amount of equipment ruined.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>Gordon savored the clammy fullness of the breeze that had tunneled its way up from the Potomac... a welcome relief from California's monotonous excellence.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i><br/></i></blockquote><br/>Britain's degradation is depicted in terms of particular institutions:<br/><blockquote><i>The newsagent's a door down proclaimed on a chalkboard the dreadful news that the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> had gone belly-up.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>The relationships - highly conventional, highly nuclear - are odd, but feel real because of all the little jokes, gestures, and support they have, and which life has.<br/><blockquote><i>"God damn, I love you," he said, suddenly grinning. Her smile took on a wry cast. Beneath the flickering street lights she kept her eyes intently on the road, "That's the trouble with going domestic. You move in with a man and pretty soon, when he says he loves you, you hear underneath it that he's thanking you."<br/></i></blockquote><br/>And I can forgive a lot of a C20th novel if it disses Freud:<br/><blockquote><i>He had oscillated in mood through 1967, not buying Penny's Freud-steeped recipes for repair... "Isn't it a little </i>obvious<i> to be so hostile to analysis?" she said once... he felt the clanky, machinelike language was a betrayal, a trap. Psychology had modeled itself after the hard sciences... but they had taken Newtonian clockwork as their example... His intutition told him that no such exterior analysis could capture what rubbed and chafed between them.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>The slowly growing apocalypse (though global) is mostly discussed by characters in Britain, so we get a highly amusing contrast between California (1963, pre-apocalypse) and Cambridge (1998, during), where the Americans are all clean and hopeful and the Brits slowly starving and fishing in sewers:<br/><blockquote><i>Mercury glowed as if alive beneath the filmed water. It gave off a warm, smudged glitter, a thin trapped snake worth a hundred guineas. "A find! A find!" Johnny chanted... They queued up to turn in their pint of the silvery stuff to the Hunt Facilitator. In line with current theory, Renfrew noted, social groupings were now facilitated, not led.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>The best subplot is probably the reptilian Oxbridge chad reverting to a heavily-armed feudal lord, including harem husbandry, as society breaks down. <br/><blockquote><i>Peterson calculated that quite enough had been done along the lines of intimidate-the-visitor and decided a gesture of indifference was needed. "Do you mind if I smoke?"<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Never mind the tachyons; there's some truly far-out notions in this, e.g.<br/><blockquote><i>Queen Elizabeth had abdicated in favor of her eldest son the previous Christmas and he had chosen to be crowned on his fiftieth birthday, in November.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>And indeed reality reasserts itself in the face of this rank authorial whimsy:<br/><blockquote><i>"Did you hear about the Coronation? They've cancelled preparations [owing to the total breakdown of law and order]."<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>I wonder if the ending - the triumph and social ascent of the man who just receives the future signals; the literal fading-away of the team that built the theory and transmitter in conditions of terrible scarcity - is a jab at someone in particular. Here's Renfrew's last word - after succeeding, but never knowing that he has:<br/><blockquote><i>He was trying a modification of the signal correlator when the lights winked out. Utter blackness rushed in. The distant generator rattled and chugged into silence. It took a long time to feel his way out and into the light. It was a bleak, gray noon, but he did not notice; it was enough to be outside. He could hear no sound from Cambridge at all. The breeze carried a sour tang. No birds. No aircraft. He walked south, towards Grantchester. He look back once at the low square profile of the Cav and in the diffused light he raised a hand to it. He thought of nested universes, onion skin within onion skin... For so long now he had been transfixed by the past. It had deadened him this real world around him. He knew, now, without knowing quite how he knew, that it was forever lost... Rather than feeling despair, he was elated, free. Marjorie lay up ahead, no doubt frightened to be alone. He remembered her preserves on the uncompromising straight shelving, and smiled. They could eat those for some time. Have some easy meals together, as they did in the days before the children. There was really quite a lot ahead to do, when you thought about it.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>About a third too long; I honestly think I could edit out a hundred pages and get a great book. Maybe this is 4* even so.</td>

(Awwwww shit: metaphor!!) Like many a bright-eyed anti-globaliser, Morgan overdoes it; at one point, a senior partner at Shorn erupts into a caricature inhuman plutocrat. I've added numbering to the exec's rant because it is such a dense cluster of Chomskyan muddled good intentions:<br/><blockquote><i>Do you really think we can </i>0)<i> afford to have the developing world develop?

Many beautiful passages, much reflection on the course of recent British history - but never didactic -<br/><blockquote><i>Ben and Ben's fellow squash prodigy, keen, bulgy-muscled Nolan Oates lolled side by side on a striped recliner and a Portofino chair chosen by Naomi and bought by Henry out of the fruits of his labours burying and burning the dead for the children of the dead.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><i>They cycled through the night, not knowing where they were going, ignoring maps, signposts, stars, anxious only to be far from that flat scrubland. Fear fuelled their tendons, pushed the pedals hard. They were oblivious to the sycamore‚Äôs grazes and to the stiff hills. Their tyres purred. They passed hamlets, silos, byres, kennels, the illumined windows of hostile hearths. The swarthy bulk of a moor‚Äôs escarpment slumped against the sky, a beast best left to lie. The world was every shade of black: slave, sump, crow, char. Clumsy clouds lumbered into each other, blind, bloated, slomo, piling up in a piggyback of obese buggers over the terrible trees. The night was loud with the shrieks and moans of creatures berating their fate and their want of shelter. When the rain came it was from a sluice that stretched from one horizon to the next. The road became a tide against them.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>and anyway it's extremely well-grounded in Meades' obsessive attention to detail (not just artistic detail, any detail)<br/><blockquote><i>The miracle of life. That baby could now bring a carbon-fibre racket into contact with a rubber ball travelling at 90 m.p.h. in such a way that the ball‚Äôs speed would be so reduced that when it touched the front wall of the court it would plummet vertically to the floor. That was a miracle. And so was the human ingenuity which made the connection between that ball‚Äôs terminal trajectory and a dead bird and advertised that ingenuity by the use of the figurative construction ‚Äòto kill a ball‚Äô. Telephones, butterfly stroke, nylon-tip pens, the emotive capability of music, the way some people are blond and some are left-handed, the shapes of faces in clouds, water‚Äôs inability to flow uphill, the tastiness of animals‚Äô flesh, pain, bustles, reptiles‚Äô poison sacs, sinus drainage, cantilevering, DNA testing ‚Äì miracles of life, all of them.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Meades is an aesthete - but still rightly unforgiving of art in the wrong place, here an experimental postmodernist roundabout that kills five.<br/><br/>It get better when it stops sneering. The middle section portrays two professions, two quiet lives: funeral director and civil engineer, warm family man and late bloomer:<br/><blockquote><i>Exclusion, Henry recognised, was what defined every profession. He practised it himself. It was what differentiated him from civilians. Without exclusion and the stamp of expertise it brought ‚Ä¶ well, the unthinkable might occur: the bereaved might realise that they could do it themselves, take the law into their own hands. They‚Äôd conduct backyard cremations. They‚Äôd dig graves in their gardens as though burying the family pet.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>The middle seems natalist; the nuclear family seem much happier. Just wait. The death of your parents as only their being "<i>denied a future of rages, chair-lifts, incontinence, slobbering aphasia, fright, wind, butter on the rug, soup on the cardie...  How long he would have had to prepare himself for the embalming job of a lifetime, how long he would have had to watch as all dignity left her and she became a machine for processing soup into diarrhoea. It might be painful watching them turn into veg, decline into insentient senescence before our eyes but at least it‚Äôs a process that acquaints us with loss gradually.</i>".<br/><br/>(Meades contrives a neat point about human nature: when the Crystal Palace burns down, the fire engines couldn't reach it to save it because the roads are congested with spectators. This isn't accurate but whatev.)<br/><br/>Oscillates between sympathy and unforgiving light; suddenly swerves away from two offered happy endings. Not sure what to make of the grim climax - the cuckold going off the deep end, becoming unmoored from his home, his work, his decency. Meades is no patriarch, so the implication shouldn't be 'so would you'. I think it's about the madness of biology, its inhumane imperatives and tragic spread.<br/><br/>Good but not a patch <a href="https://meadesshrine.blogspot.com/p/shrine.html">on his films</a>.</td>

      <td>Anecdotal evidence of the new culture, which is both orchestrated and predated upon by an amoral mafia state. <br/><br/>Postmodern dictatorship unnerves me more than the clumsy fascism of the Ba'ath or Juche. It's one thing to steal almost everything from your people; one thing to demean, torture and murder millions; one thing to employ a large fraction of the entire country as rabid unaccountable secret police. Even if you do all of this, your people still know you're evil and long for your death. It says something about me that the perversion of meaning, the co-optation of language, and erasing the possibility of objectivity is more emotionally taxing than straightforward torture kleptocracy ("<i>say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude...</i>").<br/><br/>The most appalling figure in Pomerantsev's long list is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov">Vladislav Surkov</a>. He is at first hard to credit as real: think Russell Brand crossed with Don Draper crossed with Laurentii Beria. His exploits sound like totally mental conspiracy theories, but are actually(?) open secrets:<br/><blockquote><i>... the office of the presidential administration, where Surkov would sit behind a desk with phones bearing the names of all the ‚Äúindependent‚Äù party leaders, calling and directing them at any moment, day or night. The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, rendering them absurd. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions...</i><br/></blockquote><br/>The book is <i>all</i> anecdote. He does state some statistics, but without sourcing; the book has no footnotes. We need to do better than this, what with the Kremlin's online troll army. It is journalism, then, not social theory: a picture of a hundred or so people. Russia is so skewed that one can capture some important things about by focussing on the ultra-powerful: Berezovsky and Putin, Surkov and Deripaska. <br/><br/>Pomerantsev views the "international development consultants" trying to improve matters as bumbling, ineffective ambassadors of our best side. <br/><br/>He's very glib in attributing daddy issues, as if psychology were that straightforward, as if Freud were that credible. His prose has the distracting, unbalanced sentences of indifferently translated work ("<i>developers steal so much money during construction that even the most VIP, luxury, elite of the skyscrapers cracks and sink ever so quickly</i>"; "<i>out to make a few quick quid</i>"). The drama of it all is wearing: he was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyshockers">Channel 4-style</a> hack documentarian before becoming a respected literary insider. It is much the same as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p04b183c/adam-curtis-hypernormalisation">Adam Curtis'</a> hyperactive, over-theorised view.<br/><br/>But this is still good, outraging and intelligent (e.g. he takes for granted that we will understand the contrast between Kaliningrad as the home of Kant <i>and</i> grand larceny and sleaze). A small salvo of authenticity against the Kremlin's apparent wall of disinformation and corruption.<br/><br/>I wish I knew a better book on the same topic but it's new and behind a language barrier.</td>

      <td>Curious portraits of Oxbridge people: the ordinary-language philosophers just as they were awaking from their long radical nap, and the arsey titans of Modern history (Trevor-Roper, Carr, Taylor, Namier). The book was originally a <i>New Yorker</i> series, fitting their house style ‚Äì gossip about the transcendental ‚Äì but there‚Äôs more gossip than concepts. We get to relive all the angry <i>Times</i> responses to bitchy reviews, learn what Toynbee ordered for dinner at the Athenaeum in late ‚Äô62; also the hair colour of everyone involved (Murdoch ‚Äò<i>straight and blonde, recalling the peasant aspect of Saint Joan</i>‚Äô). To their faces, Mehta is too much the deferential alumn, tentatively prodding the dons to be unkind about their peers. <br/><br/>The humans are worth it, if you already care: Austin and Namier are tragic hubristic husks; Hare, Ayer, and Toynbee‚Äôs charisma blare straight through Mehta‚Äôs quiet journalism. <br/><br/>The common point between the history and philosophy of the time is both fields' slow recovery from positivism/Wittgensteinian reductionism - the cautious return of theory, and of <i>human</i> posits. (In a sense Wittgenstein was still a reductionist when he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations">a holist</a>, since he obsessed over language even as he denied science's entry into various sides of life.) <br/><br/>Mehta has some spirit: after meeting Strawson (Snr.) he says ‚ÄúI took my leave of the scaled-down Kant.‚Äù; he finishes the book with this wonderful medievalism:<br/><blockquote><i>Unless a philosopher finds for us an acceptable faith or synthesis ‚Äì as Plato and Aristotle did together for their age, and St Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant for theirs ‚Äì we remain becalmed on a painted ocean of controversy, and for better or worse, insofar as the past is a compass to the future, there will never be anyone to whistle thrice for us and say, once and for all, ‚ÄòThe game is done!

(Trick question! there's two odds out: the first three had huge positive effects on science and society; while Jobs' and Kissinger's impact on the world is respectively "eh?" and "catastrophic".)<br/><br/>I don't really understand what people see in Jobs, "the most beloved billionaire". He was a turd to just about everyone he met from the age of about 12. <br/><blockquote><i>in the middle of seventh grade he gave his parents an ultimatum. 'I insisted they put me in a different school'. Financially this was a tough demand; his parent were barely making ends meet, but by this point there was little doubt that they would eventually bend to his will. 'When they resisted, I told them I would just quit going to school if I had to go back...'</i></blockquote><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Some</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson">of those</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive">people</a> happened to be brilliant, and responded fairly well to being treated like dirt. How much credit does this omnidickery deserve? (I've been told I'm missing the value of management skills, gumption, motivational speaking. OK, then be clear it was this and not innovation, not engineering, not design. Kottke: "<i>Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person.</i>". <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612071502/http://www.woz.org/letters/general/91.html">Also the thief.</a>) <br/><br/>In the absence of Jobs, it's hard to see it taking much longer than a couple of years for someone to introduce nice personal computers, computer fonts, portable MP3, heartfelt CGI, or omnisurveillance bricks. And maybe those others wouldn't charge through the nose. Catch the ring of pure mania here:<br/><blockquote><i>'If I had never dropped in on that single [calligraphy] course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. <br/></i></blockquote><br/>I suppose the evidence in favour of him being talented (and not just being lucky and dominating some talented people) is the string of successes (Apple, NeXT, Pixar, Apple). Not a huge sample size, but big in context.<br/><br/>I now have lots of questions, none of which Isaacson raises or settles. (In this regard it's much shallower than either his Einstein or Kissinger books.):<br/><br/>* Could we have gotten the expensive gizmos without all the abuse?<br/><br/>* What <b>was</b> the net effect of his life? <br/>Millions of pretty objects <br/>minus abandoning a child <br/>minus hundreds of petty sneers and little brutalities<br/>minus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides">30 suicides</a> ... <br/>I don't see how to do this. People like Design, sure, but how much?<br/><br/>* His personal philosophy seems straightforwardly terrible, all the worst of kneejerk Sixties exoticism. Intuition over reason ("<i>more powerful than intellect</i>"), AND will over sympathy, AND <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924574/">nature over science</a>, AND post-truth ("[Jobs'] <i>reality distortion field was a confounding melange of charismatic rhetoric, indomitable will, and eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand.</i>") What's the point of being a 'spiritual being' if you're still a dick afterward?<br/><br/>* Macs are highly underpowered for their price. In theory, this represents a grave loss of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus">consumer surplus</a>; that is, it loses the point of an economy. But I can't just say that, because people queue up for this stuff. Either they're all exquisite aesthetes who <i>gain</i> surplus by looking at their device during those long extra minutes it takes to finish processing, or the social cachet compensates. I don't have a clear idea of how to judge surplus when computers are not about computing.<br/><br/>* Your view of Gates vs Jobs is very telling. One is uncool and compromising, but has saved <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/bill-gates-philanthropy-warren-buffett-vaccines-infant-mortality">many millions of lives</a>; the other is cool and uncompromising, but, after reading Isaacson, it would not surprise me to hear that none of Jobs' $3.3bn went on philanthropy (it might have been anonymous).<br/><br/>* Do we <i>need</i> reality distorters? Must we be led into greatness by visionary liars and rogues? (Musk has a bit of this too.)<br/><blockquote><i>"If you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him 'Pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are."</i></blockquote> Sure is no way that attitude could ever do any harm. I suppose I should just be grateful he stayed out of politics.<br/><br/>Wasn't sure what to rate the book, since it is mostly clear about a dubious subject. Isaacson often stumbles into the Distortion Field <br/><blockquote>"<i>'I think I might have headed to New York if I didn't go to college', [Jobs] recalled, musing on how different his world - and perhaps all of ours - might have been..."</i><br/></blockquote><br/>but <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/09/steve-jobs-worlds-greatest-phi.html">a bit less than usual</a>.</td>

A sensitive man betrayed by the terrible course of communism, he goes in for nihilism:<br/><blockquote><i>We were hungry for belief <br/>hope fed us human flesh.</i></blockquote> <br/>(This isn't <i>generally</i> what it feels like to change your mind on something important; it rings of deconversion rather than grudging error-correction.)<br/><br/>Mackay had a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/sep/02/guardianobituaries.books">terrible time of it</a>, he suffered without even getting thrilling hubris or an heroic end. Many canonical artists had unusually hard lives and/or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity_and_mental_illness">mood disorders</a>. But it's not necessarily that sad people write better. Instead here's what I think happens: audiences do not default to being receptive to others: we need to be woken up to a book, whether by personal recommendation, or shared biographical detail, or some other gimmick. A tragic biography is the most reliable primer. (Witness the <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/217663/amy-winehouse-and-other-posthumous-sales-booms-by-the-numbers">death</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_posthumous_number_ones_on_the_UK_Albums_Chart">bump</a>.) <br/><br/>(It's not nice to attack the <i>hegemony of the sad</i> in art. 1) They are still good, when they're good; 2) they are often Witnesses, speakers-against-power, and anyone can be crushed by having to do that; 3) leave them some bloody consolation!)<br/><br/>I would love Mackay's poems to be incredible; I was extremely moved by Mackay's (self-published) <a href="http://www.onlineoriginals.com/showitem.asp?itemID=303">suicide diary</a>. But they're just ok. Of moons, angels, deserts, atomisation, Hendrix. <i>Red Ice</i> was written well before Bosnia (the crowning horror of his life), but it's already overflowing with ruined empathy and snarly emptiness and survivor's guilt. <br/><br/>Are there great paintings in only black and grey? Well, sort of. Calvary features four times in twenty poems. <br/><blockquote><i>the mountains are mere hills <br/>the calvarys are daily and inconspicuous <br/>and we are retreating into closed worlds</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Mackay was trying genocide verse, forty years after <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/adorno/#2">Adorno</a> and twenty-five after <a href="http://rinabeana.com/poemoftheday/index.php/2008/07/27/two-formal-elegies-by-geoffrey-hill/">Geoffrey Hill</a>.

(Wordsworth at Katyn. I do not think highly of Wordsworth.) The long title poem has automatic force, being as it is about the gulags and the shame of apologism (Lenin and Stalin (and Trotsky and...)). But it's also uncompressed, clumsy with rage ("<i>stop these follies of the human race</i>!"). It condemns by MacDiarmid and Sartre by name, which is rare and ok.

Whatever the response, it will never hit the right target, bringing us full satisfaction. The spectacle of America attacking Afghanistan would be just that: If the greatest power in the world were to destroy one of the poorest countries, where peasants barely survive on barren hills, would this not be the ultimate case of the impotent acting out? Afghanistan is already reduced to rubble, destroyed by continuous war during the past two decades. The impending attack brings to mind the anecdote about the madman who searches for his lost key beneath a street light; asked why he searches there, when he actually lost the key in a dark corner, he answers: ‚ÄúBut it is easier to search under strong light!‚Äù Is it not the ultimate irony that Kabul already looks like downtown Manhattan?<br/><br/> The only way to ensure that it will not happen here again is to prevent it from going on anywhere else. America should learn to humbly accept its own vulnerability as part of this world, enacting the punishment of those responsible as a sad duty, not as an exhilarating retaliation. Even though America‚Äôs peace was bought by the catastrophes going on elsewhere, the predominant point of view remains that of an innocent gaze confronting unspeakable evil that struck from the Outside. One needs to gather the courage to recognize that the seed of evil is within us too.<br/></i></blockquote></td>

      <td><i>Thinking in Systems: A Primer</i> (2008) by Donella H. Meadows</td>
      <td>An attempt to make holism rigorous; given holism's deep intuitive appeal for people, the attempt is worthy. But I was hostile to this at first ‚Äì mostly because her field helped breed a generation of pseuds who use ‚Äòreductionism‚Äô as an insult (rather than as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">a straightforward fact</a>, or a useful way of thinking, instances of which denote the highest achievements of the species). Let's get clear:<br/><blockquote><br/> ‚ÄúREDUCTIONISM‚Äù (to the pseud): The claim that complicated or immeasurable things do not exist.<br/> ‚ÄúSYSTEMS THEORY‚Äù (to the pseud): The only way of understanding things: as a whole. Everything else omits and so isn't full.<br/> <br/> REDUCTIONISM (ontology): The claim that complicated things are made of simpler things. Only the simplest of them are physically real; the rest are mental models of their interactions.*<br/> REDUCTIONISM (methodology): The attempt to isolate causes and treat phenomena in terms of their most basic units (whether quark, string, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodological_individualism">person</a>, transaction).<br/> SYSTEMS THEORY: When things get together, they exhibit features the individual things don‚Äôt.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>So stated, there is no conflict between good old reduction and shiny systems thinking. But Meadows distils the juicy bits into &lt;200pp here, and freely admits that systems theory has an intractable indeterminacy built into it, and says this, too:<br/><blockquote> <i>Ever since the Industrial Revolution, Western society has benefited from science, logic, and reductionism over intuition and holism. Psychologically and politically we would much rather assume that the cause of a problem is ‚Äúout there,‚Äù rather than ‚Äúin here.‚Äù It‚Äôs almost irresistible to blame something or someone else, to shift responsibility away from ourselves, and to look for‚Ä¶ the technical fix that will make a problem go away.<br/><br/> Serious problems have been solved by focusing on external agents ‚Äî preventing smallpox, increasing food production, moving large weights and many people rapidly over long distances. Because they are embedded in larger systems, however, some of our ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù have created further problems‚Ä¶ Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability, unemployment, chronic disease, drug addiction, and war, for example, persist in spite of the analytical ability and technical brilliance that have been directed toward eradicating them. No one deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist nonetheless.<br/><br/> That is because they are intrinsically systems problems ‚Äì undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them. They will yield only as we reclaim our intuition, stop casting blame, see the system as the source of its own problems, and find the courage and wisdom to restructure it.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Can it <i>resolve</i> empirical questions the way physics does, though? In saying, probably rightly, that a flow could go either way, depending on the state of the rest of the system and neighbouring systems, you lose or sideline <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimentum_crucis">crucial</a> power to find out a single cause's influence, and thereby know more or less exactly what to <i>do</i> to the system. In other places, knowledge comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus">isolating causes</a>. A reductionist can agree with all the clever diagrams in this, happily concede that they <i>illustrate</i> the gnarly problems of collective action and feedback and other ecosystems very clearly - and not give up their peerlessly successful method / ontological stance at all. <br/><br/><br/><br/><blockquote>* Also<br/>PHYSICALISM: Everything is made of physical things.

      <td><i>Two Kafka Plays: Kafka's Dick & The Insurance</i> (1987) by Alan Bennett</td>
      <td><i>KD</i> is fun and uncliched but quite didactic. Its irreverence is not mostly directed at Kafka, despite the aggressive-seeming title. <br/><br/><i>IM</i> relies heavily on lighting, juxtaposition, and Daniel Day-Lewis' tics. Either play is much more likely to endear Kafka to you than his own books, or any of the absurd battery of critical texts on him. <br/><br/>This is my favourite thing on Kafka:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>There are many perils in writing about Kafka. His work has been garrisoned by armies of critics with some fifteen thousand books about him at the last count. As there is a Fortress Freud so is there a Fortress Kafka, Kafka his own castle. For admission a certain high seriousness must be deemed essential and I am not sure I have it. One is nervous about presuming even to write his name, wanting to beg pardon for doing so, if only because Kafka was so reluctant to write his name himself. Like the Hebrew name of God, it is a name that should not be spoken, particularly by an Englishman. In his dreams Kafka once met an Englishman. He was in a good grey flannel suit, the flannel also covering his face... The Channel is a slipper bath of irony through which we pass these serious Continentals in order not to be infected by their gloom. This propensity I am sure I have not escaped or tried to: but then there is something that is English about Kafka, and it is not only his self-deprecation. A vegetarian and fond of the sun, he seems a familiar crank; if he‚Äôd been living in England at the turn of the century, and not in Prague, one can imagine him going out hiking and spending evenings with like-minded friends in Letchworth...<br/><br/>In that department [DIY] certainly Kafka did not excel. He was not someone you would ask to help put up a shelf, for instance, though one component of his charm was an exaggerated appreciation of people who could, and of commonplace accomplishments generally. Far from being clumsy himself (he had something of the dancer about him), he would marvel (or profess to marvel) at the ease with which other people managed to negotiate the world. This kind of professed incompetence (‚ÄòSilly me!‚Äô) often leads to offers of help, and carried to extremes it encourages the formation of unofficial protection societies. Thus Kafka was much cosseted by the ladies in his office and in the same way the pupils of another candidate for secular sainthood, the French philosopher Simone Weil, saw to it that their adored teacher did not suffer the consequences of a practical un-wisdom even more hopeless than Kafka‚Äôs.<br/><br/>One cannot say that Kafka‚Äôs marvelling at mundane accomplishments was not genuine, was a ploy. The snag is that when the person doing the marvelling goes on to do great things this can leave those with the commonplace accomplishments feeling a little flat. Say such a person goes on to win the Nobel Prize: it is scant consolation to know that one can change a three-pin plug.<br/><br/>Gorky said that in Chekhov‚Äôs presence everyone felt a desire to be simpler, more truthful and more oneself. Kafka too had this effect. ‚ÄòOn his entrance into a room,‚Äô wrote a contemporary, ‚Äòit seemed as though some unseen attendant had whispered to the lecturer: ‚ÄúBe careful about everything you say from now on. Franz Kafka has just arrived.‚Äù ‚Äô To have this effect on people is not an unmixed blessing. When we are on our best behaviour we are not always at our best.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Kafka did not make jokes in life and in art. The Trial, for instance, is a funnier book than it has got credit for and Kafka‚Äôs jokes about himself are the better for the desperate circumstances in which they were often made. He never did win the Nobel Prize but contemplated the possibility once in fun and in pain, and in a fairly restricted category (though one he could have shared with several contemporaries, Proust, Katherine Mansfield and D.H. Lawrence among them). When he was dying of TB of the larynx he was fetching up a good deal of phlegm. ‚ÄòI think,‚Äô he said (and the joke is more poignant for being so physically painful to make), ‚ÄòI think I deserve the Nobel Prize for sputum.‚Äô Nothing if not sick, it is a joke that could have been made yesterday.<br/><br/>Dead sixty-odd years, Kafka is still modern and there is much in the present-day world to interest him. These days Kafka would be intrigued by the battery farm and specifically, with an interest both morbid and lively, in the device that de-beaks the still-living chickens; in waste-disposal trucks that chew the rubbish before swallowing it; and those dubious restaurants that install for your dining pleasure a tank of doomed trout. As the ma√Ætre d‚Äô assists the discerning diner in the ceremony of choice, be aware of the waiter who wields the net: both mourner and executioner, he is Kafka. He notes old people in Zimmer frames stood in their portable dock on perambulatory trial for their lives. He is interested in the feelings of the squash ball and the champagne bottle that launches the ship. In a football match his sympathy is not with either of the teams but with the ball or, in a match ending nil-nil, with the hunger of the goalmouth... he would be concerned with the current debate on the disposal of nuclear waste. To be placed in a lead canister which is then encased in concrete and sunk fathoms deep to the floor of the ocean was the degree of circulation he thought appropriate for most of his writing. Or not, of course...<br/><br/>Had Kafka the father emigrated to America as so many of his contemporaries did, things might have turned out differently for Kafka the son. He was always stage-struck. Happily lugubrious, he might have turned out a stand-up Jewish comic. Kafka at Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Why didn‚Äôt Kafka stutter? The bullying father, the nervous son ‚Äì life in the Kafka household seems a blueprint for a speech impediment. In a sense, of course, he did stutter. Jerky, extruded with great force and the product of tremendous effort, everything Kafka wrote is a kind of stutter. Stutterers devise elaborate routines to avoid or to ambush and take by surprise troublesome consonants, of which K is one of the most difficult. It‚Äôs a good job Kafka didn‚Äôt stutter. With two Ks he might have got started on his name and never seen the end of it. As it is, he docks it, curtails it, leaves its end behind much as lizards do when something gets hold of their tail.<br/><br/>...Hermann Kafka has had such a consistently bad press that it‚Äôs hard not to feel a sneaking sympathy for him as for all the Parents of Art. They never get it right. They bring up a child badly and he turns out a writer, posterity never forgives them ‚Äì though without that unfortunate upbringing the writer might never have written a word. They bring up a child well and he never does write a word. Do it right and posterity never hears about the parents: do it wrong and posterity never hears about anything else.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>You do not necessarily need to read <i>Kafka's Dick</i> after reading that.</td>

The instant that I first heard this deadly expression, I knew as one does from the utterance of any sinister bullshit that it was very bad news. From now on, it would be enough to a member of a sex or gender, or epidermal subdivision, or erotic ‚Äúpreference‚Äù, to qualify as a revolutionary.

It would never have done for any of us to stand up and say that our sex or sexuality or pigmentation of disability were qualifications in themselves. There are many ways of dating the moment where the Left lost or ‚Äì I would prefer to say ‚Äì discarded its moral advantage, but this was the first time I was to see the sell-out so cheaply.</i><br/><br/><i>the Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwah... was, if I can phrase it like this, a matter of everything I hated versus everything I loved. In the hate column: dictatorship, religion, stupidity, demagogy, censorship, bullying, and intimidation. In the love column: literature, irony, humor, the individual, and the defense of free expression... To re-state the premise of the argument again: the theocratic head of a foreign despotism offers money in his own name in order to suborn the murder of a civilian citizen of another country, for the offense of writing a work of fiction. No more root-and-branch challenge to the values of the Enlightenment (on the bicentennial of the fall of the Bastille) or to the First Amendment to the Constitution, could be imagined.</i><br/><br/><i>I had become accustomed to the pseudo-Left new style, whereby if your opponent thought he had identified your lowest possible motive, he was quite certain that he had isolated the only real one. This vulgar method, which is now the norm and the standard in much non-Left journalism as well, is designed to have the effect of making any noisy moron into a master analyst.</i><br/><br/><br/><i>Today I want to puke when I hear the word 'radical' applied so slothfully and stupidly to Islamist murderers; the most plainly reactionary people in the world.</i></blockquote><br/>But never mind that.

(In fact he is very critical of academic theorists and applied leftists both):<br/><br/><blockquote><br/><i>Foucault‚Äôs ascendancy in turn was precisely within <br/>those fields of academic endeavor that both became the haven for former radicals, but <br/>that were themselves most completely divorced from any access to political power, or <br/>increasingly, even to real social movements‚Äîwhich gave Foucault‚Äôs emphasis on the <br/>‚Äúpower/knowledge‚Äù nexus, the assertion that forms of knowledge are always also forms <br/>of social power, indeed, the most important forms of social power, a particular appeal.  <br/>No doubt any such historical argument is a bit caricaturish and unfair; but I think <br/>there is a profound truth here. It is not just that we are drawn to areas of density, where <br/>our skills at interpretation are best deployed. We also have an increasing tendency to <br/>identify what‚Äôs interesting and what‚Äôs important, to assume places of density are also <br/>places of power. The power of bureaucracy shows just how much this is often not the <br/>case. </i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Grovels to standpoint theory when he is told that they had similar ideas earlier (which he hadn't read and which they never put so clearly). But pure and clear and witty, heretical to his tribes - and as original as always. <br/><blockquote><br/><i>...if we‚Äôre going to actually come up with robots that will do our laundry or tidy up the kitchen, we‚Äôre going to have to make sure that whatever replaces capitalism is based on a far more egalitarian distribution of wealth and power ‚Äî one that no longer contains either the super-rich or desperately poor people willing to do their housework. Only then will technology begin to be marshaled toward human needs. And this is the best reason to break free of the dead hand of the hedge fund managers and the CEOs‚Äîto free our fantasies from the screens in which such men have imprisoned them, to let our imaginations once again become a material force in human history.</i></blockquote><br/></td>

When I lean on the shoulder of the woman I love, and can see, let‚Äôs say, the peace of a twilight over a mountain landscape, gold-green fields, the shadows of trees, black-nosed sheep motionless behind hedges and sun about to disappear behind craggy peaks, and know ‚Äî not from the expression on her face, but from within the world as it is ‚Äî that she is seeing the same world, and that this convergence is part of the world; that love constitutes precisely, at that very moment, the paradox of an </i>identical<i> difference, then love exists, and promises to continue existing. The fact is she and I are now incorporated into this unique subject, the subject of love that views the panorama of the world through the prism of our difference, so this world can be conceived, be born, and not simply represent what fills my own individual gaze. Love is always the possibility of being present at the birth of the world.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>Clearer prose than you'd expect, though, isn't it?<br/><br/><blockquote>* e.g. laziness: his claim about there being four "conditions" of philosophy, none of which are in fact <i>necessary</i> conditions, and one of which is good old dyadic love:<br/> <blockquote><i>Anyone who doesn't take love as their starting-point will never discover what philosophy is about.</i></blockquote><br/>(Never mind, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070901095011/http://www.neurological.org.nz/html/article.php?documentCode=26">Cavendish</a>; oh well <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#Personal_relations">Newton</a>, sorry Schopenhauer; you tried real hard.)<br/></blockquote><br/></td>

She makes up for the long-missing romanticism single-handed! The two-hundred year eclipse of the Bayesian method was much longer than that suffered by even the irrationally-maligned <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Continental_drift#/Rejection_of_Wegener.27s_theory.2C_1910s.E2.80.931950s">continental drift</a> theory (50 years). And this neglect and opprobrium was suffered by a paradigm now accepted everywhere as powerful and useful in literally all kinds of research. <br/><br/>She wins us over, particularly with her chapter on the secretive, truculent, omnicompetent genius John Tukey, who used Bayesian methods for elections 40 years before <i><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">Fivethirtyeight</a></i>, with comparable success. But her prose is borderline, with lots of clear but dim-bulb sentences. <br/><br/>She has one infuriating mannerism: she constantly refers to Bayes' rule, Bayesian logical foundations after Bayes, Bayesian inference, <i>and</i> personalist Bayesian epistemology by the single terrible metonym "Bayes": <br/><blockquote><i>At its heart, Bayes runs counter to the deeply held conviction that science requires total objectivity and precision. Bayes is a measure of belief.<br/><br/>...even many nonstatisticians regarded Swinburne's lack of care and measurement as a black mark against Bayes itself.<br/><br/>...Bayes, on the other hand, seemed to produce results that corresponded more closely to sociologists' intuitions.<br/><br/>...Wagner took along the youngest and greenest of his three-man staff, Henry Richardson, who had earned a PhD in probability theory all of seven months earlier. He would be Bayes' point man at Palomares.</i></blockquote><br/>I suppose she did this to elide away jargon, but it both equivocates between very different entities, hides the complexity of the 'Bayesian' marquee, invites the idea that the frequentists were attacking a logically sound theorem, and produces a whole list of bizarre images, where we see the reclusive Reverend doing all these things: cracking Enigma and Tunny, finding H-Bombs lost at sea, calculating appropriate worker's comp amounts in the absence of reliable data, attributing <i>The Federalist Papers</i> to Hamilton, and blocking 99.9% of the spam email from reaching you (yes, you). <br/><br/>It is also even <i>more</i> unfair to Laplace than usual. (It was he who developed Bayesianism into the powerful applied framework it is, into more than a single gambler's theorem. Ok, so "Laplace-Coxism" is admittedly even less admissible as a term to which the wise and honest may repair.) <br/><br/>Grammatical twitching aside this was a fun introduction to an important thing.<br/><br/>She focusses on the soft, social side (and on applications vaguely summarised). There was a huge amount of factional bitching between these serious and cloistered men:<br/><blockquote><i>Attending his first Bayesian conference in 1976, Jim Berger was shocked to see half the room yelling at the other half. Everyone seemed to be good friends, but their priors were split between the personally subjective, like Savage's, and the objective, like Jeffrey's - with no definitive experiment to decide the issue.<br/>In a frustrated circle of blame, Persi Diaconis was shocked and angry when John Pratt used frequentist methods to analyze his wife's movie theater attendance data, because it was too much for the era's computers to handle. But one of the low moments of Diaconis' life occurred in a Berkeley coffee shop, where he was correcting proofs of an article of his and where Lindley blamed him for using frequency methods. "And you're our leading Bayesian", Lindley complained. Lindley, in turn, upset Mosteller by passing up a chance to conduct a big project using Bayes instead of frequency...<br/>Asked how to encourage Bayesian theory, Lindley answered tartly, "Attend funerals".</i></blockquote><br/>This human focus means she gives no treatment of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cox's_theorem">Cox's theorem</a>, certainly the most remarkable result in formal epistemology (and probability theory?), and one of the main things which rationally warrants the partisanship and excitement she displays for Bayesian thought throughout. ("<a href="http://biasandbelief.pbworks.com/w/page/6537213/References%20on%20the%20Cox%20Proof">Justified fundamentalism</a>", as one great commentator puts it!) It proves that any attempt to use numbers to model belief must be Bayesian or logically equivalent to it. With other results, it raises Bayesianism to the only viable quantitative theory of rationality and of right learning, a behemoth of which Aristotelian logic is a mere special case. No doubt I'm unusual in finding this the most exciting bit.<br/><br/>She's to be applauded for digging out novel examples of Bayesian analysis which were classified or which avoided using the word: early actuarial work, Tukey's US election model, the pre-Three-Mile-Island federal report of reactor safety, and the entire field of operational research. But she is so concerned with emphasising the (genuine) long oppression of the paradigm that she under-emphasises the good reasons to resist Bayesian methods before 1980: they were simply computationally intractable before MCMC. (Which makes the sheer effort put in to shortcuts and approximation methods by ingenious people quite tragic; they just aren't needed anymore, thirty years later.) To her credit, she does mention the parallel dogmatism of the 60s Bayesians and the presumptive overenthusiasm of some people in the last 10 years. <br/><br/>(The great contemporary frequentist, Deborah Mayo, is able to subtitle her blog "<a href="https://errorstatistics.com/about-2/">Frequentists in Exile</a>" without being absurd - even though Stats 101 and "Methods for [Social Science]" courses are still everywhere dominated by canned Fisherian tests and frames. She means exile from the philosophy of statistics and probability.)<br/><br/>Insofar as you want to understand the large trends of the present and coming age, you need to know its economics; insofar as you must understand the new economics, you must understand AI; insofar as you must understand AI, you must understand machine learning and decision theory; insofar as you must understand machine learning, you must understand <a href="http://blog.shakirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bayes_Deep.pdf">both frequentism and Bayesianism</a>. Insofar as you do not yet have the mathematics to understand Bayesianism, nor the excitement of the promise of a final, real synthesis of objective with subjective, you must read this gentle prose work. Once you are excited by its vague promises, you can find progressively more rigorous people and will have actually have reason to stomach the formalism.<br/><br/>3/5, 4*/5 for those just beginning the march.<br/><br/><br/><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H2gE7COadso/V1LP1e71xYI/AAAAAAAACls/FoZwG_oIjEU_tR4rhYg6cuJ3jh-bCjYjgCLcB/s1600/b5c26f9b444a6805027e2f8cc18fd59d.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H2gE7COadso/V1LP1e71xYI/AAAAAAAACls/FoZwG_oIjEU_tR4rhYg6cuJ3jh-bCjYjgCLcB/s640/b5c26f9b444a6805027e2f8cc18fd59d.jpg" /></a>(c) African Sonata (c.2000) by Vladimir Kush</div></td>

      <td><i>A Structured Approach to the Adam Smith Problem</i> () by Hodder, Christopher</td>
      <td>The third PhD I have ever read, the first to which I've contributed, and certainly the best-written. ‚ÄùThe "Adam Smith Problem" is just that Smith's two big books seem to dramatically contradict each other: <a href="http://econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html"><i>WoN</i></a> is methodologically and normatively individualist and abstracts out the economy from the rest of human life, but <a href="http://econlib.org/library/Smith/smMS0.html"><i>ToMS</i></a> is a holistic and altruistic picture, one which subsumes economic behaviour as a special case of all virtuous or vicious actions. Hodder's job, which, remarkably, went undone over 200 years of scholarly debate, is to consider the possible explanations (e.g. "Smith divides society into disjoint private and public spheres"; "one of the two books is ironic"; "he changed his mind"; "he was a idjit") through close exegesis and logical reconstruction, and somehow weigh them.<br/><br/>The conclusion is satisfying enough: <i>What is the Adam Smith Problem?: A debate on a problem; the debate was the problem</i>. Basically, a series of bad readers (from the German Historicists to Paul Samuelson) misread certain key terms and passages, imputed an anachronistic atheism and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes#Agent">efficient-causation</a> empiricism to him, and then propagated a straw-man ("a <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/226156/pdf">shadow history</a>") throughout the secondary literature and the tertiary sewer we call the media. (They also missed the timing and the explicit initial audience of <i>WoN</i>: the book is avowedly a polemic to affect British trade policy, and a highly successful one at that.)<br/><br/>Hodder writes with absolutely minimal jargon; this is as easily grasped as C18th political economy can be. One of my notes was that an institutionalised marker might penalise it for omitting jargon to the degree it does; after all, what's the point if just anyone can waltz in to constructive thought without using the gaudy tools made in desperation by knowledge pieceworkers?:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>Sympathy plays a far more foundational role in </i>WN<i> than has previously been noted by any scholar which I have encountered. If we return to the butcher, brewer and baker, example, where we address ourselves not to their benevolence but to their self-interest, all commentators seem to have overlooked the question of how we are to go about addressing ourselves to another's self-interest. The obvious and simple answer to this is Sympathy. We put ourselves in their place, we realise that they expect to be paid for their labour as we would expect to be paid for our own, and as a result we understand that the appropriate behaviour expected of us is to pay for their service. In the primitive society, where the hunter begins to trade his bows for food and starts down the long road towards commercial society, it must be Sympathy which alerts his fellow hunters that he wants something in return for the bows he produces. ‚ÄúGive me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want‚Äù requires that I can escape my own self-interest and understand what you want, and have at least a basic level of Sympathy for you otherwise I would not know what to offer you.<br/><br/>Sympathy must therefore apply to trade at a very foundational level, and that intimate Sympathy which fosters benevolence can take hold even in business relationships. All it requires is repeated dealings with the same person, and a character which is ‚Äúwell-disposed‚Äù. It is not said to be central to society - but this is entirely consistent with </i>TMS<i>, where Smith describes benevolence as ‚Äúthe ornament that embellishes‚Äù society, that which makes it happier rather than merely efficient.</i></blockquote><br/>I do wonder at the fact that someone with no historiographical background and only half an economics degree could make substantive corrections and suggestions at the very frontier of the field's knowledge of <i>a canonical figure</i>. In one way this is nice: reason is a universal solvent, and specific facts make up relatively little of total intellectual work! But in another way sad: the pompousness and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary-work">boundary-work</a> of the non-formal academic fields is again shown to be needless, and narrowing.</td>

But this is also a winning early bet: that rap is poetry, that it was and would be "the decade's most important and influential pop movement":<br/><blockquote><br/><i>Our opinion, then, from a distance: not only is serious rap poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great U.S. Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we‚Äôve been encouraged sadly to write off, it‚Äôs quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. ‚ÄòReal‚Äô (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocal, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn‚Äôt get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers..</i><br/></blockquote><br/>Your enjoyment will depend on you giving a crap about the sheer horror of rap's initial context and being able to tolerate intentionally torturous pomo prose and juxtapositions (e.g. <i>I Dream of Jeannie</i> vs race riots).

      <td><i>Kissinger</i> (1992) by Walter Isaacson</td>
      <td>Balanced coverage of the great monster, including his meteoric rise from penniless immigrant German Jew to a permanent spot in the highest caste of global influence; his academic conceit (the longest-ever thesis at Harvard), and his ceaseless inveigling and brown-nosing. (In case you don't know, Kissinger is probably the greatest war criminal in American history.) Res ipsa loquitur:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>Whenever peace ‚Äî conceived as the avoidance of war ‚Äî has been the primary objective of a power or a group of powers, the international system has been at the mercy of the most ruthless member of the international community. [A more proper goal is] stability based on an equilibrium of forces.<br/><br/>If I had to choose between justice and disorder, on the one hand, and injustice and order, on the other, I would always choose the latter.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>There's not a lot of editorial from Isaacson. He respects Kissinger's single-mindedness and intellectual clout, while giving us plenty of his egotism and blandly evil wonkishness:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>Here was an example of what would become a pattern in Kissinger‚Äôs diplomacy: his attempt to mediate a dispute by finding a semantic formulation to finesse differences. In this case it was devising a phrase that linked the bombing halt to the negotiations, without sounding like a condition. Later, at the end of the war, he would search for ambiguous phrases about the demilitarized zone and South Vietnamese sovereignty that could be read differently in Hanoi and Saigon. Sometimes these word games paid off. But usually they opened Kissinger up to accusations that he had left important disagreements unresolved by talking out of both sides of his mouth.<br/><br/>[during the 1970 election, R v N ] At the convention, the Rockefeller forces, with little to lose, sent Kissinger to talk to the Iowa delegation. ‚ÄúIt was so novel to me,‚Äù he told a reporter at the time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never met working politicians before. I didn‚Äôt attempt to talk their language. I just talked what I knew.‚Äù The Iowa delegation voted overwhelmingly for Nixon.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Isaacson soft-pedals the mass chaos and death Kissinger gave rise to. And much more has come to light about Kissinger's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/opinion/sunday/nixons-vietnam-treachery.html?_r=0">personal</a> <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/henry-kissinger-hillary-clintons-tutor-in-war-and-peace/">responsibility</a> for it, since Isaacson published this. <br/><br/>Dr Strangelove wasn't based on Kissinger, but I find it impossible not to think of Peter Sellars (or Woody Allen) when reading about the tragic success of this erotomaniacal egomaniac.<br/><br/>Hitchens' <i>Trial of Henry Kissinger</i> is much more salient.<br/></td>

It was weird, when you thought about it. They only remembered where they were from if they wanted to complain about how awful it was there, or, later, to remember it as a place of infinite promise, a place whose light had been hidden from them until it became unrecoverable, at which point its gleam would become impossible to resist.</i></blockquote><br/>There are perhaps too many passages that drift off from a concrete event into abstraction, and which then finish on a short, suggestive raised-eyebrow sort of sentence. Like:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>He had lost a lot of blood. His eyes were half-open, and he seemed to recognize that somebody he knew was with him, but he said nothing. He drew great, deep breaths at intervals.

We face four types of dislocating technologies: Genetics, Robotics, Infotech and Nanotech. <br/><br/>Garreau gives loads of stage time to two dogmatic cranks from each side: Kurzweil (booster technocrat), and Fukuyama (neocon fearmonger) as well as an unclassifiable polymath, Jaron Lanier. But this is sadly just the way <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ">science journalism is done</a>, and Garreau is later courageous in half-endorsing the transcendent transhuman rationale of beautiful bioprogressive Bostrom.

You wouldn't want to spend time with young Bourdain; too edgy, too miserable, too addled. At no point does he disown his wild years, but this is written as a different, charming, distant man. I suppose this made him a star because honesty and filth are rare in high cuisine, or in the received notion of high cuisine. He refers to himself as a "cook" throughout (or even "cookie"), endearingly. <br/><br/>Anyone else playing at being a junkie cuisinier, sexual tyrannosaurus, smash-hit author, primetime travel host, and, most recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmgRXUmYncE">jiujitsu japer</a> would surely be risible.

      <td>Much better than I thought it'd be! Literary, clear, almost bipartisan. As a former socialist finance minister, he has a healthy blend of actual economic knowledge and smouldering will to improve an irrational status quo. (He uses "irrational" <i>far</i> more than the usual pejoratives: "greedy" or "exploitative" or "neoliberal".) <br/><br/>He makes lots of literary allusions and shares personal tales of fascist Greece. These make the deadly dull business of postwar European monetary politics readable. He talks about the duty of surplus nations to stabilize the world system, which is true and good but unworkable. He has a remarkable admiration for American institutions and figures - not just the New Dealers, but also, in a way, for Volcker and Geithner - while also pointing out astutely. Full marks for tone, basically. <br/><br/>    A good writer, with only a couple of wrongfooted sentences. Potted history of post-war international macroeconomics. <br/><br/>    His policies do not much resemble socialism: all the same neoliberal institutions exist in Varoufakisland. He'd just use them to help the vulnerable. <br/><br/>    America (Harry White, Volcker) had a chance to stabilise the world, but instead grabbed national interest at the expense of others. Then - according to Varoufakis - they grabbed hegemony at the expense of their own, which is even more depressing.<br/><br/>His current-account focussed theory is a bit narrow. There is already a eurozone surplus recycling mechanism, for instance. His 2015 Greek finance policies continue to look better than the current blind bailout plus permadeflation solution: Greece should have defaulted. His (and Holland's) recommendations are very sensible.<br/><br/>Despite being short, it is really repetitive; I skimmed chapters 4-6 heavily.
