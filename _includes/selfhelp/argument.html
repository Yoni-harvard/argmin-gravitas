	<li>The category "self-help" or "self-improvement" covers too much for comfort.</li>
	<li>Better to split it into at least 4 classes, with different goals and criteria:</li>
	<li>"Lifehacks": conscious changes to your environment or actions. Optimising.</li>
	<li>"Attempts": things you try out or perform without understanding fully. Generative.</li>
	<li>"Techniques": conscious mental exercises to change your mindset. Deliberative.</li>
	<li>"Seeking": mental exercises with a focus on emotion or phenomenology, not very analysable. Contemplative.</li>
