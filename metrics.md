I use a few obscure scales of measurement to give you an idea. I use:


### David's Spiegelhalter's informal evidence quality!

(For serious work I use the Cochrane Collaboration's GRADE scale:

* GRADE ⊕⊕⊕⊕ : Well-run randomized trials.
* GRADE ⊕⊕⊕ : Downgraded randomized trials; or upgraded observational studies.
* GRADE ⊕⊕ : Observational studies (or double-downgraded randomized trials).
* GRADE ⊕ : Case reports (or triple-downgraded randomized trials; or downgraded observational studies).
	

1. Large magnitude effect.
2. All plausible confounding would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect.
3. Dose-response gradient.

1. Likely biased design and implementation.
2. Indirect evidence (indirect population, intervention, control, outcomes).
3. Unexplained inconsistency of results (subgroup analyses).
4. Imprecision of results (wide confidence intervals).
5. Likely publication bias.


### Spiegelhalter confidence 

**** - 95%: We understand the underlying process. 
Although we cannot predict what is going to happen, we can provide good numerical assessments.

*** - 80%: We are reasonably confident in our analysis. 
We can expect numbers to change as we learn more, but not sufficient to justify major policy shifts.

** - 60%: New evidence could have a substantial impact on our assessment, although no major new surprises are expected. 
We encourage a robust decision-making approach with some precaution and adaptivity

* - 50%: We have very limited understanding of the process or possibilities. 
Resilience to unexpected occurrences is called for.



### Christgau on universality of artworks

One way an artwork can be important is if it is _universal_. The great music critic Robert Christgau scores all albums [on this scale](https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php).


### Galef on book impact 

Julia Galef has a neat taxonomy of ways that books can affect your worldview.
