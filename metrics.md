When reporting the quality of things, I use the following scales of measurement:


* [Estimate quality](#spiegel-quality)
* [Study quality](#cochrane-quality)
* [Confidence](#confidence)
* [Art universality](#christgau-art)
* [Types of impacts from books](#galef-books)
* [Book worthiness](#leech-books)

#### Spiegelhalter on the quality of a statistic
David Spiegelhalter, professor of statistics, has a nice rule of thumb for how much to trust estimates:

* 4* : 
* 3* :
* 2* :
* 1* :
* 0* : No information content; worse than useless.

#### Cochrane on evidence quality
For serious work I use the Cochrane Collaboration's [GRADE scale](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_12/12_2_assessing_the_quality_of_a_body_of_evidence.htm):

* GRADE ⊕⊕⊕⊕ : As good as a well-run randomized trial.
* GRADE ⊕⊕⊕ : As good as a downgraded randomized trial; or an upgraded observational study.
* GRADE ⊕⊕ : As good as an observational study (or a double-downgraded randomized trial).
* GRADE ⊕ : As good as case reports (or triple-downgraded randomized trials...

#### Spiegelhalter on confidence in an analysis 
* \*\*\*\* - 95%: We understand the underlying process. Although we cannot predict what is going to happen, we can provide good numerical assessments."

* \*\*\* - 80%: "We are reasonably confident in our analysis. We can expect numbers to change as we learn more, but not sufficient to justify major policy shifts."

* \*\* - 60%: "New evidence could have a substantial impact on our assessment, although no major new surprises are expected. We encourage a robust decision-making approach with some precaution and adaptivity."

* \* - 50%: "We have a very limited understanding of the process or possibilities. Resilience to unexpected occurrences is called for."

#### Christgau on the universality of artworks

One way an artwork can be important is if it is universal: is its quality obvious even to people who aren't into that sort of thing. Robert Christgau scores all albums [on this scale](https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php).

#### Galef on book impacts 

Julia Galef has [a neat taxonomy](https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/) of ways that books can affect your worldview. Her model is that a book can 1) offer you new Data, or 2) Theories to explain data, or 3) arguments for Values, or 4) an entire Thinking style. She also assigns a number 1-5, roughly "Most Concrete -> Most General" for each type.

#### Leech on book durability

I approximate a book's value by guessing how often I'll reread them. This rewards dense books, sure, but also ones with long-term value, durability, appeal to people of different ages, and also just pleasure and beauty. I think most books are not worth the time and a small number (< 8% in [a highly selected sample](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPIKI3TO5MpKtyg9DzsK6TOo6NhjHAHZbv3iS2yxnSo/edit?usp=sharing)) are worth more than one reading.

* 1/5: Not worth one reading.
* 2/5: One read maybe, if you're into the topic.	   	
* 3/5: Worth one skim.
* 3*/5: Great fun, one read. 'Mind candy'.
* 4/5: Very good. but one read will do..
* 5?/5: Amazing. Will reread.
* 5/5: Have reread and expect to do so indefinitely. A companion.
