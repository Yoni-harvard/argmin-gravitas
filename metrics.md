I use these scales for rating things:
<a name="spiegel-quality"></a>

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Spiegelhalter on an estimate's quality</h3>
	<div>

	<h3>Cochrane on evidence quality</h3>
	<div>For serious work I use the Cochrane Collaboration's <a href="{{GRADE}}">GRADE scale</a>:<br><br>
		<ul><li>GRADE ⊕⊕⊕⊕ : As good as a well-run randomized trial.</li>
		<li>GRADE ⊕⊕⊕ : As good as a downgraded randomized trial; or an upgraded observational study.</li>
		<li>GRADE ⊕⊕ : As good as an observational study (or a double-downgraded randomized trial).</li>
