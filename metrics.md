I use the following scales for the quality of things:


* [Estimate quality](#spiegel-quality)
* [Study quality](#cochrane-quality)
* [Confidence](#confidence)
* [Art universality](#christgau-art)
* [Types of impacts from books](#galef-books)
* [Book worthiness](#leech-books)

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Spiegelhalter on an estimate's quality</h3>
	<div>

[David Spiegelhalter][Spieg] has a nice rule of thumb for how much to trust estimates:

	<div class="accordion">
		<h3>4* : <i>numbers we can believe</i></h3>
		<div><blockquote>so accurate than we can, to all intents and purposes, treat them as true</blockquote>.</div>

		<h3>3* : <i>numbers that are reasonably accurate</i></h3>
		<div><blockquote>the figure is probably accurate within a relative ±25%: a claimed proportion of 12% could actually be anywhere between 9% and 15%</blockquote>.</div>

		<h3>2* : <i>numbers that could be a long way out</i></h3>
		<div></div>

		<h3>1* : <i>numbers that are unreliable</i></h3>
		<div><blockquote>the true figure could well be more than double or half what is claimed.<br>
		(On the odds scale, for proportions.)</blockquote></div>

		<h3>1* : <i>numbers that were just made up</i></h3>
		<div>Not evidence; negative information. Even odds of having the correct sign.</div>
	</div>
	</div>
	(Obviously for some things - pharmacology and space travel come to mind - anything but 4* is unacceptably poor.)

#### Cochrane on evidence quality
For serious work I use the Cochrane Collaboration's [GRADE scale][GRADE]:

* GRADE ⊕⊕⊕⊕ : As good as a well-run randomized trial.
* GRADE ⊕⊕⊕ : As good as a downgraded randomized trial; or an upgraded observational study.
* GRADE ⊕⊕ : As good as an observational study (or a double-downgraded randomized trial).
* GRADE ⊕ : As good as case reports (or triple-downgraded randomized trials...

	
<a name="confidence"></a>
<br>---<br>

#### Spiegelhalter on confidence in an analysis 
* \*\*\*\* - 95%: We understand the underlying process. Although we cannot predict what is going to happen, we can provide good numerical assessments."

* \*\*\* - 80%: "We are reasonably confident in our analysis. We can expect numbers to change as we learn more, but not sufficient to justify major policy shifts."

* \*\* - 60%: "New evidence could have a substantial impact on our assessment, although no major new surprises are expected. We encourage a robust decision-making approach with some precaution and adaptivity."

* \* - 50%: "We have a very limited understanding of the process or possibilities. Resilience to unexpected occurrences is called for."

#### Christgau on the universality of artworks

One way an artwork can be important is if it is universal: is its quality obvious even to people who aren't into that sort of thing. Robert Christgau scores all albums [on this scale][Christg].

#### Galef on book impacts 

Julia Galef has [a neat taxonomy][Galef] of ways that books can affect your worldview. Her model is that a book can 

1. offer you new Data, or 
2. Theories to explain data, or 
3. arguments or scenes aimed at taking on particular Values, or 
4. an entire Thinking style. 

She also assigns a number 1-5, roughly "Most Concrete -> Most General" for each type.

<a name="leech-books"></a>

#### Leech on book durability

I approximate a book's value by guessing how often I'll reread them. This rewards dense books, sure, but also ones with long-term value, durability, appeal to people of different ages, and also just pleasure and beauty. I think most books are not worth the time and a small number (< 8% in [a highly selected sample][MyReading] are worth more than one reading.

* 1/5: Not worth one reading.
* 2/5: One read maybe, if you're into the topic.	   	
* 3/5: Worth one skim.
* 3*/5: Great fun, one read. 'Mind candy'.
* 4/5: Very good. but one read will do..
* 5?/5: Amazing. Will reread.
* 5/5: Have reread and expect to do so indefinitely. A companion.
