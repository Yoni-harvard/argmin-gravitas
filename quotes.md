> An aphorism is an algorithm, of we know not what input,
to we know not what output.

— Gwern Branwen

I probably won't get around to systematically stating a worldview. Such things are maybe bad for you anyway. But I like aphorisms, so here's the atomic version of it:

> Es ist gleich tödlich für den Geist, ein System zu haben, und keins zu haben. Er wird sich also wohl entschließen müssen, beides zu verbinden. 
(It is equally fatal to the spirit to have a system and to not have a system. One will likely have to combine the two.)
— Friedrich Schlegel

> all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong can they be before they are not useful.
— George Box




What you can imagine depends on what you know. Philosophers who know only philosophy consign themselves to a janitorial role in the great enterprises of exploration that are illuminating the mysteries of our lives.
— Daniel Dennett, but


The penalty for not doing philosophy isn't to transcend it, but simply to give bad philosophical arguments a free pass.
— David Pearce


To be right, be vague. To be productively wrong, be precise.


...however true [your claim] may be, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth... Truth, thus held, is but one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which enunciate a truth.
— JS Mill, or


He that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves, and sharpens our skill. Our antagonist is our helper.
— Edmund Burke


There are no subject matters; no branches of learning - or, rather, of inquiry: there are only problems, and the urge to solve them. A science such as botany or chemistry is, I contend, merely an administrative unit... even serious students are misled by the myth of the subject. And I should be reluctant to call anything that misleads a person a convenience to that person.
— Karl Popper


Doctors bury their mistakes, architects cover them with vines, teachers send theirs into politics.
— Frank Lloyd Wright, plus


It is easy to lie with statistics, but it is easier to lie without them.

...the reason human beings could not reject ideas because they were bad: Ideas on Earth were badges of friendship or enmity. Their content did not matter. Friends agreed with friends, in order to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with enemies, in order to express enmity.
— Kurt Vonnegut Jr.


Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.
— Donald Knuth


There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.
— Leonard Cohen


Questioning presuppositions will not be effective unless one can show that there exist genuine alternatives. This takes time.
– after Richard Rorty, or, You can't beat a horse with no horse.




Schneier's mantra of intervention:
>   1. What's the target variable?
>   2. What intervention promotes it?
>   3. How much will it help (B)?
>   4. What new problems will the intervention induce (P)?
>   5. At what cost (C)?
>
>   If (C + P) > B, don't intervene.


MacAskill's rubric for an altruist act A:
    How many people does A affect, and by how much? (Magnitude)
    Is A the best thing to do? (Relative magnitude; opportunity cost)
    What's the difference my doing A makes? (Effect minus counterfactual effect)
    What's the difference that one more A makes, on the margin? (Marginal benefit)
    How sure is A to help? What harms does A risk? (Risk)



Καθ ἕτερον μὲν λόγον ἡμῖν ἐστιν οἰκειότατον ἄνθρωπος, καθ ὅσον εὖ ποιητέον αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀνεκτέον· καθ ὅσον δὲ ἐνίστανταί τινες εἰς τὰ οἰκεῖα ἔργα...

Be nice, be provocable, be forgiving, and be clear.
— Robert Axelrod


«Человек слаб, надо дать ему задачу по силам»,— говорят люди. Это все равно, что сказать: «руки мои слабы, и я не могу провести линию, которая была бы прямая, то есть кратчайшая между двумя точками, и потому, чтоб облегчить себя, я, желая проводить прямую, возьму за образец себе кривую или ломаную». Чем слабее моя рука, тем нужнее мне совершенный образец.

'Man is weak – he must receive a task which accords to his strength,' people say. This amounts to: 'My hands are weak; I cannot draw a straight line, and therefore, in order to make it easier for myself, though I wish to draw a straight line, I will take a curved or a broken line as my guide.' The weaker my hand is, the more perfect must my guide be.
— Lev Tolstoy


For evil to triumph, all that is required is for good men to respond rationally to incentives.

If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.

— Clive James


Man is a noble animal; splendid in ashes and pompous in the grave.

Economic: It is hard to change people. It always depends. Things fall apart, but sometimes into place also. People aren't stupid. Most things fail. Sometimes there is no right answer. You are the system.


over time amateurs blow their lead by focusing less and relying on easier, more direct methods. They rely more on informal conversation as analysis method, they prefer personal connections over open competitions in choosing people, and they rely more on a perceived consensus among a smaller group of fellow enthusiasts. As a result, their contributions just don’t appeal as widely or as long.
— Robin Hanson


Eine Hauptregel für... solche, die ihre eigenen Empfindungen beschreiben wollen, ist: ja nicht zu glauben, daß, weil sie solches tun, dieses bei ihnen eine besondere Anlage der Natur dazu anzeige. Andere können dieses vielleicht ebenso gut als du. Sie machen nur keine Geschäfte daraus, weil es ihnen einfältig vorkommt, solche Dinge bekanntzumachen.

(A principal rule for... those who want to describe their own sensations, is not to believe that their doing so indicates they possess a special disposition of nature in this respect. Others can perhaps do it just as well as you can. Only they do not make a business of it, because it seems to them silly to publicize such things.)
– Georg Lichtenberg


What I cannot create, I do not understand.

A man who sets out to justify his existence and his activities has to distinguish two different questions. The first is whether the work which he does is worth doing; and the second is why he does it... The first question is often very difficult, and the answer very discouraging...
