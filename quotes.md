> Se méfier des penseurs dont l'esprit ne fonctionne qu'à partir d'une citation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Beware of thinkers whose minds function only when fuelled by a quotation.)

<div align="center">— Emil Cioran</div><br>

<br>

I probably won't get around to systematically stating a worldview. (Such things are maybe bad for you anyway.) But I like aphorisms, so here's an atomic version of it:

<br>

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>epistemology</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/epistemology.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>politics</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/politics.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>ethics</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/morals.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>programming</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/code.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>maths</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/maths.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>ultimately</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/existence.html %}
	
	</div>
	<h3>briefs</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/tersely.html %}
	
	</div>
	<h3>art</h3><div>
	
	{% include quotes/art.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>perlis</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/perlis.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>pessoa</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/pessoa.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>gide</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/gide.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>cioran</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/cioran.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>nietzsche</h3><div>

	{% include quotes/fritz.html %}

	</div>
	<h3>me</h3>
	<div><ul>

		<li>Mantra: <i>One</i>, what are they saying? <i>Two</i>, are they telling the truth? <i>Three</i>, does their reasoning follow? <i>Four</i>, what are they missing out? <i>Five, or, zero</i>: why are they writing about this at all? </li>
		<br /><br />

		<li><i>Trust a work of criticism in proportion to the amount of direct quotations it makes.</i></li>
		<br /><br />

		<li>We must treat fools differently to assholes &#8211; and almost everyone is more fool than asshole.</li>
		<br /><br />

		<li><i></i>I don't love economics; I hate bad economics.</li>
		<br /><br />

	</ul></div>

</div>


> An aphorism is an algorithm, of we know not what input,
to we know not what output.
