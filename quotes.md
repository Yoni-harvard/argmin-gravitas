> Se méfier des penseurs dont l'esprit ne fonctionne qu'à partir d'une citation.
(Beware of thinkers whose minds function only when fuelled by a quotation.)

— [Emil Cioran][Cioran]

> An aphorism is an algorithm, of we know not what input,
to we know not what output.

— Gwern Branwen

I probably won't get around to systematically stating a worldview. Such things are maybe bad for you anyway. But I like aphorisms, so here's the atomic version of it:

<br><br>

<div class="accordion">

	<h3>me</h3>
	<div><ul>

	<li>One, what are they saying? Two, are they telling the truth? Three, does their reasoning follow? Four, what are they missing out? Five, or, zero: why are they writing about this at all? (The critical mantra.)</li>

	</ul></div>

</div>
