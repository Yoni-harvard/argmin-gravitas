My current projects are:<br>

<div id="listFrame"></div>


{%  include js/lazyFrame.html %}
<script>  
    var src = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UPP_74QYHZ3wysRL9Oe7Qr8SNIyaa9A8E957S5F3NAY/pubhtml?chrome=false";
    definiteEvent( createIframe, [src, "listFrame"] ); 
</script>


and some less readable things:

* Reading the King James Bible in full, one chapter a day. (3 years' labour.)
* Further stats education.
* O'Reilly Spark certification.
* Joining a choir.
