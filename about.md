> over time amateurs blow their lead by focusing less and relying on easier, more direct methods. They rely more on informal conversation as analysis method, they prefer personal connections over open competitions in choosing people, and they rely more on a perceived consensus among a smaller group of fellow enthusiasts. As a result, their contributions just don’t appeal as widely or as long.

— Robin Hanson


I'm Gavin Leech, a data scientist at a large organisation and a '[research parasite](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/01/22/attack-of-the-research-parasites)'. This site is for original research into poverty, animal welfare, scientometrics, and [long content](http://www.gwern.net/About#long-content) in general.

I am inspired by writers and citizen scientists like '[Scott Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com/)', '[Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net)', '[Jeff Kauffman](https://www.jefftk.com/index)', [Andrew Gelman](http://andrewgelman.com/), '[Noah Smith](noahpinionblog.blogspot.co.uk/)', '[Kelsey Caring](http://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/http://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/)', '[Artir Nintil](https://nintil.com/)', and '[Chris Dillow](http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/)'.

I'm a member of [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/), a group of people who have pledged substantial amounts of their lifetime income to the most effective charitable causes around. I'm aiming to give 50% overall, or equivalent labour. My reasoning on which causes are most important is here; my present basket of charities is here.
