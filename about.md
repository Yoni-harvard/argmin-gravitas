I'm Gavin Leech, a data scientist at a large organisation and a '[research parasite](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/01/22/attack-of-the-research-parasites)'. This site is for original research into poverty, animal welfare, citizen scientometrics, .

I'm a member of [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/), a group of people who have pledged to use substantial amounts of their lifetime income on the most effective charitable causes around. I'm aiming to give 50% overall. My reasoning about which causes are most important is here; my present basket of charities is here.
