I'm Gavin Leech, a data scientist at the giant insurer [AXA][Axa] <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>. I write prose and software about things like <a href="{{stat}}">applied philosophy of science</a>, global poverty, animal welfare, epistemic standards, scientometrics. 

I'm trying to be more empirical in my writing. I also aim for the pieces to still be useful [decades][LongContentIsLong] from now. (Those last two sentences pull in opposite directions.)

I identify as as little as possible; my premises, projects and preferences say much more about me than my social identity does. I never really mastered anything: my schooling was in two meta-domains, philosophy and software. But I'm doing a proper mathematics curriculum now, which is bound to bring me closer to reality <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>.

Current projects [here][Proj].

<h3>Giving</h3>
	<div>I'm a member of <a href="{{GWWC}}">Giving What We Can</a>, a group of people who pledge substantial amounts of their lifetime income to the most effective charitable causes around. I'm giving <a href="{{MyGiving}}">10% this year</a>, aiming at 50% overall <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>. My reasoning on which causes are most important is forthcoming; my present basket of charities is forthcoming.<br><br>

		<h3>Inspired by</h3>
		<div>
			People like '<a href="{{Gwern}}">Gwern Branwen</a>', <a href="{{Luu}}">Dan Luu</a>, <a href="{{Gelman}}">Andrew Gelman</a>, '<a href="{{Scott}}">Scott Alexander</a>', '<a href="{{Kelsey}}">Kelsey of Caring</a>', <a href="{{scaruffi}}">Piero Scaruffi</a>, <a href="{{dave}}">David Pearce</a> inspire me.<br><br>

	<div class="accordion">
		<h3>Title</h3>
		<div>
			The title alludes to Iain Banks' <i><a href="{{Cult}}">Culture</a></i> novels, in which pompous people are mocked with ship names that have little <i>gravitas</i>. To take the <i><a href="{{Arg}}">arg min</a></i> of something is to find the thing which results in its lowest value.

		<h3>Why so many quotations?</h3>
		<div>
			<a href="{{quot}}">Well, they're the densest store of insight</a>. We are not empiricists by nature or by culture, so they are my concession to the apeish narrative side of mind. That quotes page is like a message digest of 10 years of me reading and learning. 

			<br><br>I sometimes regret my instinctual distrust of Twitter: a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern">contemporary</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dril">aphorists</a> must be whiling away the years on there.<br><br>

	<div class="accordion">
		<h3>Loss function</h3>
		<div>Above all I hope to beat the trend spotted <a href="{{Doom}}">by Robin Hanson</a> about independent scholars:<br><br>
			<blockquote>over time amateurs blow their lead by focusing less and relying on easier, more direct methods. They rely more on informal conversation as analysis method, they prefer personal connections over open competitions in choosing people, and they rely more on a perceived consensus among a smaller group of fellow enthusiasts. As a result, their contributions just don’t appeal as widely or as long.</blockquote>

		<h3>Gavins Leeches</h3>

			I am not an <a href="{{driving}}">English driving instructor</a>, nor an <a href="{{eire}}">Irish bank manager</a>, nor an <a href="{{oz}}">Australian sheep farmer</a>, nor an <a href="{{sugar}}">Australian sugar worker</a>.

	<div class="accordion">
		<h3>What's with all these accordions?</h3>
		<div>
			<a href="{{Hide}}">Information hiding</a> is a basic condition of good large software; these accordions are a prose analogue. The hope is that, by tucking away wires, I can write long things without triggering anyone's TL;DR reflex.<br><br> 

			It also sort of simulates a dialogue with the reader: I plant a question, and then they prompt for the response.
