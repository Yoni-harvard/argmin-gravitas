> It is equally fatal to the spirit to have a system and to not have a system. <br>One will likely have to combine the two. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>

I'm Gavin Leech, a data scientist at the giant insurer [AXA][Axa] <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>. I write prose and software about things like <a href="{{stat}}">applied philosophy of science</a>, global poverty, animal welfare, epistemic standards, scientometrics. 


I'm trying to be more empirical. I also aim for my writing to be useful [decades][LongContentIsLong] from now. Those last two sentences pull in opposite directions.


I identify as as little as possible; my premises, projects and preferences say much more about me than my social identity does. I never really mastered anything: my schooling was in two meta-domains, philosophy and software. But I'm doing a proper mathematics curriculum now, which is bound to bring me closer to reality <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>.


You can contact me by <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> or anonymously [here][Form].<br><br><br>

		I'm a member of <a href="{{GWWC}}">Giving What We Can</a>, a group of people who pledge substantial amounts of their lifetime income to the most effective charitable causes around. I'm giving <a href="{{MyGiving}}">10% this year</a>, aiming at 50% overall <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>. My reasoning on which causes are most important is forthcoming; my present basket of charities is forthcoming.<br><br>
