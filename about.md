I'm Gavin Leech, a data scientist at a large private org, and also a '[research parasite][Parasite]'. This site is for original contributions to poverty, animal welfare, statistical reanalyses, [scientometrics][Sciento]; I aim to write essays and software still worth using [decades from now][LongContentIsLong].


My current projects are:

* [A library against link rot][Rot].
* [Making up ways to measure political controversy][Contro]
* [Looking for value in social anthropology][Anthro].
* A study of poverty's inefficiencies.
* A critique of juries (and maybe also all human law).
* [The most morally anachronistic people in history][PridePrescience].
* A guide to _Adventure Time_ for international-relations realists.

and, less readably:

* Reading the King James Bible in full, one chapter a day. (3 years' labour.)
* Further stats education.
* O'Reilly Spark certification.
* Joining a choir.
* Kaggle for verifiable modelling skills.


I am inspired by people like [Uri Simonsohn][Colada], '[Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net)', [Jeff Kauffman](https://www.jefftk.com/index), [Andrew Gelman](http://andrewgelman.com/), '[Scott Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com/)', [Noah Smith](noahpinionblog.blogspot.co.uk/), '[Kelsey Caring](http://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/)', '[Artir Nintil](https://nintil.com/)', and [Chris Dillow](http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/).

I'm a member of [Giving What We Can][GWWC], a group of people who have pledged substantial amounts of their lifetime income to the most effective charitable causes around. I'm giving [15% this year][MyGiving], aiming at 50% overall (or equivalent labour). My reasoning on which causes are most important is <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="Forthcoming">here</span>; my present basket of charities is <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="Forthcoming">here</span>.

I hope to beat the trend [spotted by Robin Hanson][Doom] about independent scholars:

> over time amateurs blow their lead by focusing less and relying on easier, more direct methods. They rely more on informal conversation as analysis method, they prefer personal connections over open competitions in choosing people, and they rely more on a perceived consensus among a smaller group of fellow enthusiasts. As a result, their contributions just donâ€™t appeal as widely or as long.
