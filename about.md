> It is equally fatal to the spirit to have a system and to not have a system. <br>One will likely have to combine the two.

<div align="center">— Friedrich Schlegel <a href="fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a></div><br />


I'm Gavin Leech, a data scientist at a large private org, and also a '[research parasite][Parasite]'. This site is for original studies and statistical reanalyses of things like poverty, animal welfare, [scientometrics][Sciento] and the quantified self. I aim to write essays and software still worth using [decades from now][LongContentIsLong]. [My current projects are here][Proj].

People like [Uri Simonsohn][Colada], '[Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net)', [Jeff Kauffman](https://www.jefftk.com/index), [Andrew Gelman](http://andrewgelman.com/), '[Scott Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com/)', [Noah Smith](noahpinionblog.blogspot.co.uk/), '[Kelsey Caring](http://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/)', '[Artir Nintil](https://nintil.com/)', and [Chris Dillow](http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/) inspire me.


<a name="giving"></a>

I'm a member of [Giving What We Can][GWWC], a group of people who have pledged substantial amounts of their lifetime income to the most effective charitable causes around. I'm giving [15% this year][MyGiving], aiming at 50% overall (or equivalent labour). My reasoning on which causes are most important is <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="Forthcoming">here</span>; my present basket of charities is <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="Forthcoming">here</span>.

The title alludes to Iain Banks' _[Culture][Cult]_ novels, in which people mock pompous aliens by giving themselves names with lots of _gravitas_. To take the <i>[arg min][Arg]</i> of a function is to find the thing which results in the lowest value.

Above all I hope to beat the trend [spotted by Robin Hanson][Doom] about independent scholars:

> over time amateurs blow their lead by focusing less and relying on easier, more direct methods. They rely more on informal conversation as analysis method, they prefer personal connections over open competitions in choosing people, and they rely more on a perceived consensus among a smaller group of fellow enthusiasts. As a result, their contributions just don’t appeal as widely or as long.
