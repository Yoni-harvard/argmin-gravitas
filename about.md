> It is equally fatal to the spirit to have a system and to not have a system. <br>One will likely have to combine the two. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>

I'm Gavin Leech, a data scientist at a large private org and a '[research parasite][Parasite]', or independent scholar. I write about things like poverty, animal welfare, [scientometrics][Sciento], and the quantified self. I aim for these to still be worth using [decades][LongContentIsLong] from now. Current projects [here][Proj].<br>


<div class="accordion">
	<h3>TMI</h3>

		<h3>Giving</h3>
			<div>I'm a member of <a href="{{GWWC}}">Giving What We Can</a>, a group of people who have pledged substantial amounts of their lifetime income to the most effective charitable causes around. I'm giving <a href="{{MyGiving}}">10% this year</a>, aiming at 50% overall (or equivalent labour). My reasoning on which causes are most important is forthcoming; my present basket of charities is forthcoming.

			<h3>Inspired by</h3>
			<div>
				People like <a href="{{Colada}}">Uri Simonsohn</a>, '<a href="{{Gwern}}">Gwern Branwen</a>', <a href="{{Luu}}">Dan Luu</a>, <a href="{{Gelman}}">Andrew Gelman</a>, '<a href="{{Scott}}">Scott Alexander</a>', <a href="{{Noah}}">Noah Smith</a>, '<a href="{{Kelsey}}">Kelsey of Caring</a>', '<a href="{{Artir}}">Artir Nintil</a>', and <a href="{{Dillow}}">Chris Dillow</a> inspire me.<br>
			</div>

		<div class="accordion">
			<h3>Title</h3>
			<div>
				The title alludes to Iain Banks' <i><a href="{{Cult}}">Culture</a></i> novels, in which pompous people are mocked with ship names that have lots of <i>gravitas</i>. To take the <i><a href="{{Arg}}">arg min</a></i> of something is to find the thing which results in its lowest value.

		<div class="accordion">
			<h3>Loss function</h3>
			<div>Above all I hope to beat the trend spotted <a href="{{Doom}}">by Robin Hanson</a> about independent scholars:
				<blockquote>over time amateurs blow their lead by focusing less and relying on easier, more direct methods. They rely more on informal conversation as analysis method, they prefer personal connections over open competitions in choosing people, and they rely more on a perceived consensus among a smaller group of fellow enthusiasts. As a result, their contributions just don’t appeal as widely or as long.</blockquote>

			<h3>What's with all these accordions?</h3>
			<div>
				<a href="{{Hide}}">Information hiding</a> is a basic condition of good large software; these accordions are a prose analogue. The hope is that, by tucking away wires, I can write long things without triggering anyone's TL;DR reflex. Should be some effect from the induced voluntary engagement of clicking, too.
