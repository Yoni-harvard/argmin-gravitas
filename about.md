> It is equally fatal to the spirit to have a system and to not have a system. <br>One will likely have to combine the two. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>

<div align="center">— Friedrich Schlegel</div><br />


{%	include about-links.html	%}


I'm Gavin Leech, a <a href="/data-science">data scientist</a> at the giant insurer [AXA][Axa]. I write prose and software about things like <a href="{{stat}}">applied philosophy of science</a>, global poverty, animal welfare, epistemic standards, [scientometrics][Sciento]. I'm trying to be more empirical in my writing. I aim for these to still be worth using [decades][LongContentIsLong] from now. Those last two sentences pull in opposite directions. 

Current projects [here][Proj].

I never really mastered any domain: my schooling was in two meta-domains, philosophy and machine learning. But I'm doing a proper mathematics curriculum now, which is bound to bring me closer to reality <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>.

I am very fond of <a href="/quotations">aphorisms</a>, the densest store of insight, and I sometimes regret my instinctual distrust of Twitter: a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern">contemporary</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dril">aphorists</a> must be whiling away the years on there.<br><br>

		<h3>Giving</h3>
			<div>I'm a member of <a href="{{GWWC}}">Giving What We Can</a>, a group of people who pledge substantial amounts of their lifetime income to the most effective charitable causes around. I'm giving <a href="{{MyGiving}}">10% this year</a>, aiming at 50% overall <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>. My reasoning on which causes are most important is forthcoming; my present basket of charities is forthcoming.

			<h3>Inspired by</h3>
			<div>
				People like <a href="{{Colada}}">Uri Simonsohn</a>, '<a href="{{Gwern}}">Gwern Branwen</a>', <a href="{{Luu}}">Dan Luu</a>, <a href="{{Gelman}}">Andrew Gelman</a>, '<a href="{{Scott}}">Scott Alexander</a>', <a href="{{Noah}}">Noah Smith</a>, '<a href="{{Kelsey}}">Kelsey of Caring</a>', '<a href="{{Artir}}">Artir Nintil</a>', and <a href="{{Dillow}}">Chris Dillow</a> inspire me.<br>

			<h3>Languages</h3>
			<div>
				I try to be nonpartisan about computer languages, since antagonism between language communities is a really clear example of how strong identities cause perversities. At work I write Python and bash, along with a little Pig.
				<br><br>

				Languages I like for various reasons:

				<ul>
					<li>For development speed: Python</li>
					<li>For execution speed: Go</li>
					<li>For static or for money: C#</li>
					<li>For stats sophistication: Stan</li>
					<li>For nostalgia and portability: bash</li>
					<li>For elegance: Clojure</li>
					<li>For puzzles: uKanren</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Title</h3>
			<div>
				The title alludes to Iain Banks' <i><a href="{{Cult}}">Culture</a></i> novels, in which pompous people are mocked with ship names that have lots of <i>gravitas</i>. To take the <i><a href="{{Arg}}">arg min</a></i> of something is to find the thing which results in its lowest value.

			<h3>Loss function</h3>
			<div>Above all I hope to beat the trend spotted <a href="{{Doom}}">by Robin Hanson</a> about independent scholars:<br><br>
				<blockquote>over time amateurs blow their lead by focusing less and relying on easier, more direct methods. They rely more on informal conversation as analysis method, they prefer personal connections over open competitions in choosing people, and they rely more on a perceived consensus among a smaller group of fellow enthusiasts. As a result, their contributions just don’t appeal as widely or as long.</blockquote>

			<h3>What's with all these accordions?</h3>
			<div>
				<a href="{{Hide}}">Information hiding</a> is a basic condition of good large software; these accordions are a prose analogue. The hope is that, by tucking away wires, I can write long things without triggering anyone's TL;DR reflex.<br><br> 

				It also sort of simulates a dialogue with the reader: I plant a question, and then they prompt for the response.
