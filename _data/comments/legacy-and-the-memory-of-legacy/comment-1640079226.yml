message: "While a part of the desire to be remembered individually seems narcissistic and egoistic, the overall 'leaving a legacy' aspect seems more natural - to the extent that 'having preferences over the world states after my death' seems natural. (I do have those quite strongly.)<br><br>For example, a famous artist may not care for their memory in particular being preserved - but they strongly care about the future of particular (sub)culture they represent, and their memory is a good and most concrete representation of that (and one they have most control over).<br><br>(I also think there are 'heuristic' and 'memetic' reasons to want to be remembered: You being remembered / leaving a legacy is a good heuristic for your descendants or culture to fare well in the world.  And the memes that our mind runs are (evolutionarily) more likely to be the kind that care about their fate after the demise of the mind, thus endorsing us wanting to leave a legacy. Again, if the memes of the individual are somewhat differentiated from their 'general' version, they will want to preserve the specific memory rather than just boost the general ones.)<br><br><br><span style='font-weight:bold'>Gavin: Great points.<br><br>I was aware of skirting a silly Epicurus-style attitude (ruling out current preferences after my death by fallacious reasoning), but I decided to leave the post simple for once. I agree it's fine to have these preferences, as a subset of it being fine to have preferences about things other than your immediate conscious experiences.<br><br>Being remembered as you is indeed a decent proxy or placeholder or trojan for your ethos.<br><br>Memetic pressure seems less convincing, in the modern age: it's very easy for my memes to spread without reference to me, for my arguments to shuck the heavy meat that generated them. I suppose the argument is that by <i>bundling</i> my memes under my name they all gain some fitness / their fidelity is increased by cross-referencing and mutual reinforcement.<br><br>For a funny example, see the viral uptake of <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=you+are+personally+responsible+for+becoming+more+ethical&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiX6r-L15P2AhXcC98KHceVARAQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=you+are+personally+responsible&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYOgcIIxDvAxAnOgYIABAHEB5QnQdYtBFg-xloAHAAeAKAAfYBiAHNB5IBBTYuMy4xmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=iAgVYpeGC9yX_AbHq4aAAQ&bih=1999&biw=1152'>Yudkowsky's lovely line</a> among basic activists.</span><br>"
