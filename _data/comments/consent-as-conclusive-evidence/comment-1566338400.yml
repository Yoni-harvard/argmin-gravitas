message: "Respecting explicitly stated boundaries is good habits, and a way to focus limited resources on more constructive ends<br><br> 	Every second Harry spends agonising over (and, later, justifying) his choice is a second he could be spending thinking about the best way to get the rest of the platoon home safely.<br><br>  	'absent deception' isn't pointing the way you think it is. Tom's 'please don't' could be a mask for various arguments he can't say explicitly: 'I'm convinced that the enemy is a lot more humane to prisoners than our propaganda says, but I don't want to undercut morale by saying that in front of everyone, and considering my circumstances you'd probably decide this well-thought-out belief of mine is wishful thinking', 'I have a brilliant plan for surviving the enemy which we don't have time for me to explain and which I know you wouldn't expect to work', 'I didn't actually hurt my leg that badly, I'm just using this as an excuse to desert with a facade of honor', etc.<br><br> Tom is opaque to Harry, but also Harry is opaque to the rest of the world. An army where you can coup-de-grace someone who didn't ask you to is one where unpopular privates just 'happen' to walk into a lot of traps, which just 'happen' to make them 'impossible' to save.<br><br> Ignoring explicitly stated boundaries when you think you have a good reason is just one of those things, like military interventions in the Middle East, that keeps being less effective than it seems like it should, even when you think you've taken this effect into account."
