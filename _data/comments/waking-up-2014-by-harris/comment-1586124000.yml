message: "About:<br>> 'Even if I accept that mindfulness is a source of value, thereâ€™s presumably still a tradeoff against clearer, quicker, more public sources: doing science or kindnesses or pleasures. 10 days spent in myself is 10 days not learning, not exercising, not enjoying, not helping, not meeting, in solitary. (And even on the contemplative axis it competes with Stoicism, with yoga, with writing, with psychedelics.)'<br><br> I feel like: most things I can do in the time I'm meditating will bring me no lasting satisfaction - but meditating on the other hand feels to have potential to expose the <i>mechanisms</i> of satisfaction - and potential of freeing me from the loop of satisfaction seeking to some extent<br><br> Many activities feel pointless to me similarly like playing games is pointless. Even though one could argue that fun of playing is good enough in itself. It's a valid point.<br><br> Knowing that there is no lasting satisfaction in whatever I'm trying to achieve robs it of its allure.<br><br> I can learn to enjoy the process and seek things that maximize the enjoyment. Maybe that's one of the things that enlightment is about. Or maybe it's possible to become independent of the seeking satifaction loop. it feels to me that's what buddhism is claiming.<br><br>> 'Iâ€™m not actually worried by this, because I suspect the full-Buddhist anti-striving thing is unnecessary andâ€¦ undesirable.'<br><br> this is a good question<br><br> From the point of view of striving person, no-striving state is obviously undesirable. Still, I wonder how it feels like ðŸ˜€ Once you're not-striving you obvoiusly don't regret not reaching states you were striving before. The no-striving state feels to me to be a totally new kind of experince. Like if you were color-blind entire life and suddenly you are cured. In this sense it feels more interesting than other things I could be doing. <br><br> The cost of reaching it is super high though. When i describe it like this i feel to be super far from it hehe<br><br> I have to add that I also sometimes have the thoughts of the sort: I'm a fairly capable guy. I could maybe provide myself with a reasonably stable stream of temporary satisfactions and use the kind of mediatation/mindfulness/yoga/relaxation/quality social time tools to help myself in the times of feeling low.<br><br> It has the benefit of not having to become kind of monk and meditating for several years or sth. And is more socially accepted. <br><br>Another thing is that dedicating myself to meditation feels a bit selfish."
