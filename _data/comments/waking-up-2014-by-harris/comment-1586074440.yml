message: Sometimes I can see visual static if I focus or begin to deconstruct noises and I’ve come to think there’s not much value in that sort of thing. I know two big exceptions. People with chronic pain can deconstruct the pain (“oh it’s just tingling plus throbbing”). People with chronic hate-myself-but-not-others can come to see themselves as just another person in the world and then treat themselves better.
