One frame I've gotten good mileage from: I sit / am still when I'm not sure what action would be good to do next on the present margin. (It definitely took some doing to even get to a place where I can sometimes realize that I'm actually unsure about what would be good to do next, and this place continues to often be inaccessible to me, e.g. when I'm caught up in addictive internet loops.) This gels nicely with my view that a lot of cognition is unconscious / not directed willfully. <br><br> Being still gives space for this cognition to continue while stepping out of sticky/addictive behavior patterns (for a while). So it doesn't feel like it cuts against my productivity very much, at least not at my current level of practice.<br><br> > '(And even on the contemplative axis it competes with Stoicism, with yoga, with writing, with psychedelics.)'<br><br>In my experience these have been mostly complementary, not competitive."
