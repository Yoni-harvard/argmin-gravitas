Well, only if you believe that there is anything of substance to be found in that self-report hall of mirrors.<br><br><b>Gavin: It's not my field, so I probably missed some. If you have failed replications you want me to add, I'll check em out.</b><br><br>Oliver: It's not so much that there are failed replications in personality psychology. It's more that if you ask the same thing in slightly different ways, on two or more different questionnaires, you're bound to get impressive correlations and more or less fool-proof replications. But what is gained in this manner? Little in the way of understanding anything of substance. I taught personality at UM Ann Arbor for 7 years and am glad that I no longer have to do it. It's a mostly sterile field due to that hall of mirrors thing.<br><br>Not that I am into power posing & co as an alternative. Doing good, replicable, nontrivial behavioral science is tough business.<br><br>In any event, good to see Andrew posting your comment on his blog. That's how I took notice of yours. I'll be sure to stop by more frequently in the future."
