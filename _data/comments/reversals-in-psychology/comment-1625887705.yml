I think that section needs an update!<br><br><b>Gavin: I'm confused. My entry says \"Good evidence against ego depletion, that willpower is limited in a muscle-like fashion.\" You're saying that the replications themselves don't replicate, and so there isn't good evidence <i>against</i> it?</b><br><br>KO: Yes that's correct. This is a pretty big deal in social psychology. Many professors are choosing to not teach ego depletion at all anymore. This Psych Today article gives you a basic rundown in addition to what I already shared<br><br><b>Gavin: OK. We're not disagreeing.</b>"
