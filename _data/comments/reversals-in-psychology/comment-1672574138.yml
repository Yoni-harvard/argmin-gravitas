message: "Why are you so determined to try and disarm and prove things to be wrong which so many people still take such solace from? A lot of these things you're 'disproving' still help a great many people to make sense of the world. Just because it is now required by modernity to 'disprove' these inconvenient but common sense truths doesn't mean that they aren't still the 'lived experience' of a lot of people when it comes to understanding human behaviour.<br><br><b>Gavin: People can believe what they like; but a scientist absolutely cannot. As soon as you make claims from the position of authority they do, pretend to objectivity through statistics that they do, you are fair game and a higher standard applies.<br><br>I don't want to be unkind, but there's also a rich irony in your comment. Academic psychology of the last 70 years received most of its status and popular attention from <i>subverting</i> folk claims about the human mind. Now that the formal claims are shown to be radically weaker than sold, you come in and defend academic psychological science as a folk way of knowing, just like the ones it undermined.</b>"
