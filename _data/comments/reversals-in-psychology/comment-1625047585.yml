message: "Overall nice list! One recommendation I'd make is to rephrase the passage describing ego depletion, as it somewhat combines two slightly related (but distinct) effects. Ego depletion refers to the idea that self control is a \"limited resource\" and exerting self control can \"fatigue\" individuals in different ways. \"Cognitive fatigue\" more generally is the observation that repeated boring, tedious, or difficult mental tasks (like remembering sequences of numbers, answering math problems, etc.) can impact future decisions and behavior (by reducing accuracy, reducing motivation for additional tasks, task disengagement, etc.).<br><br><b>Gavin: alright</b>."
