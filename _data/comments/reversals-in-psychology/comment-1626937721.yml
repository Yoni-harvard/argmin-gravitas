Which boots look better to guys at the bar? Does weight lifting or yoga work better for back pain?

It's not impossible to tell the difference between the two though - just ridiculously expensive and way below the cost-benefit bar.<br><br>Luckily, as either a scientific or a practical matter, the distinction between null effects and ultra-moderated effects is moot. If something really does <a href='https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/20/book-review-all-therapy-books/'>only work</a> when John Bargh or Alfred Adler apply it in person, then we can pretty safely ignore it, because we can't use it at scale.<br><br>(Obviously I'm open to a rigorous study of charisma effects, and the expectancy / demand characteristics literature is a good start at something similar.)<br><br>(If the ultra-moderated thing is the only thing which has ever been seen to work for the problem, then we could investigate, or just try more stuff. Trying more things is likely a better option in almost all cases.)</b>"
