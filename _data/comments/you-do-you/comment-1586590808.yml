message: "A reading which did not occur to me at the time: this conversation <b>could</b> have been not actually about me.<br><br> I was at Pride, personally rejecting pride. There are people who would take this as throwing shade.<br><br> My lovely interlocutor's protests would then be 'belief as attire': said not to reassure me, but instead to affirm pride in identity and the sanctity of Pride. My preferences for myself would be beside the point: on Pride day, everyone accepts themselves. It wasn't that he was failing to apply his principle of self-acceptance on the second-order I needed; it was that I was failing to join in, to go along with the spirit of things. (On the philosophical level, it's also possible to view pride as more important / separate from mere happiness.)<br><br>I wasn't knocking anyone else's pride, just noting my own lack of it. But group events have their own negative feedback mechanisms. If it were a faux pas to even opt out, then I probably wouldn't go.<br><br>I'm pretty confident that he was in fact speaking on the object level, about me and not People, about philosophy and not ideology, from interactions we had later. But it's interesting to note how political gently opting out of something <i>could</i> be."
