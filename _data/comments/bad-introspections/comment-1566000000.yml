message: "I suspect that introspection-done-right is largely about breaking or counteracting negative patterns, not establishing positive ones. I recently saw a video that I'd uncharitably sum up as 'I used to harass random strangers for liking Marvel movies, but then I realised every tree is actually the same tree, so I stopped doing that and started feeling better.' I'm genuinely glad that person had that revelation.<br><br> Also, if we're defining introspection widely enough, I think it's as much about constructing as discovering. As someone perennially low on sense-of-identity, I can't really begrudge people for putting in the time to build that for themselves, even if they tend to look (and/or be) crazy while doing so."
