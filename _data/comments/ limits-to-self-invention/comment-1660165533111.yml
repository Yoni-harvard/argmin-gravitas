message: "I think I'd benefit from undergoing such a personality change (the one about graduating summa cum laude). Don't think this article gives very practical advice on *how* to exactly do it, unfortunately.<br><br>My guess is this:<br>1. Study cultural codes.<br>Read autobiographies and watch YouTube *by real people*, possibly meet them in real life. For some things finding 'good material' could be hard. Would beware of fiction.<br>Make a list of behaviours and beliefs (or intrinsic characteristics) that determine that identity ('role').<br><br>2. Memorise this list.<br>Think about situations primarily in your daily routine where your behaviour deviates from theirs. Then try to do it their way. Write in a 'research journal' to reflect on which actions you should have taken.<br><br>3. Try to 'feel' yourself posessing this identity.<br>Arnold Schwarzenegger has this in his biography, where he thought about becoming a strongman so much and hard, that he somehow imprinted it on his intuitive understanding of who he was. What he saw in the mirror no longer felt right. I find that very compelling.<br>This could be a thought exercise done while falling asleep, for instance. Or maybe you have to do it 'in the moment'?<br><br>Idk, I ended up writing that out for myself"
