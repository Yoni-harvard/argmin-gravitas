message: "I'd say that LaTex isn't worth learning. Lyx helps a lot (WYSIWYG editor), both with editing and reading. You can do almost any basic LaTex task in Lyx, such as writing integrals and so on. If I need something fancy done (almost never), I can hack it in LaTex afterwards. (I find it much easier to use Lyx rather than markdown + MathJax too.)"
