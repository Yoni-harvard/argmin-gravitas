message: "You list the people who have >99% confidence that human extinction _won't_ happen as people who don't need to worry about reducing x-risk. Toby Ord has an argument against this (excerpt from the [80,000 hours podcast with Toby][link1]):\r\n\r\n> If people think that it’s almost impossible to destroy humanity — maybe they think that the risk per century is something like one in a million — then they also seem to be somewhat committed to thinking that we’re going to get about a million centuries if we survive this century, because that’s what it looks like if you have a constant hazard rate of one in a million per century, that was the expectation. In which case the amount of value if we avoid extinction, goes up, roughly proportionately, such that even though there’s only a small amount of risk, if we could avoid that risk, it would actually have a similar value compared to if there was a 1% chance (in which case there’d be fewer expected centuries).\r\nThis doesn’t work out as cleanly with more realistic models, but those more realistic models actually suggest the future is even more important than this.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, this argument really hinges on the [Astronomical Waste Argument][link2], but also I think it relies on some assumptions on the rate of diminishing returns from reducing x-risks. One argument could be that the future conditional on humanity surviving for a long time with >99% probability is just so immensely valuable that even factoring diminishing returns wouldn't change the results (which goes back to the Astronomical Waste Argument).\r\nPerhaps paradoxically, the people who assign a very low probability to humanity surviving this century (say < 1%) would probably be the ones who need not worry about x-risk reduction, since it's almost certain that they won't succeed in doing so (I have very low confidence on this since it seems to imply an asymmetry with Toby's argument).\r\n\r\n  [link1]: https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/why-the-long-run-future-matters-more-than-anything-else-and-what-we-should-do-about-it/\r\n  [link2]: https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html"
