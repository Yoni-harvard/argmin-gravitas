message: "Haven't seen it, but yeah I followed the streams.\r\n\r\nIt's fair to say that human players can have multiple goals (winning, personal satisfaction, looking cool, whim). Not sure how often these other goals come up among the pro group who were compared to AGZ. Still, how much of the 45% deviance are you willing to put on human holism, vs simple error or lack of foresight? \r\n\r\nYou might control for holism by increasing the stakes. But the stakes were already very high in the case of the two big games: the world watching, human exceptionalism on the line, etc.\r\n\r\nA distinct big problem with my argument is that it treats a game as a set of independent moves, which is obviously wrong. Not sure if this invalidates anything."
