message: "I donâ€™t think it is a problem, the lack of rigour at the OU. Maths is a compulsory subject and most people learn mathematics to solve real world problems and do other things. Being a research mathematician is very rarely the reason for studying mathematics anyway. It is still a far more impressive course than functional skills, GCSE or A level maths. Though these courses will still earn you more money."
