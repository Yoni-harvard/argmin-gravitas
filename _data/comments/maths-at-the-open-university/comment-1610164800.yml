message: "Hi Arjun!<br><br>Great question. I now think this is the biggest problem with OU maths. It is neither as rigorous nor as impressively creative as other university mathematics.<br><br>But we shouldn't ignore the upside: most people on the course are not aiming to become research mathematicians; they're aiming to understand certain concepts and algorithms, to get a foundation for applications. A certain amount of bookwork and repetition is required for that, and the OU does the job. I have seen people you would never expect to do *any* mathematics critiquing a choice of optimiser based on Lipschitz conditions, and this is a wonderful thing.<br><br>Luckily there are plenty of places in the world for the tiny minority of people who can take on maths in its full challenge. (e.g. MathWorld, Olympiads, StackExchange - even Wikipedia is often rigorous).<br><br> The later courses' exercises are less rote and include new (small) proofs, but the 'spot the algorithm' questions never go away.<br><br>Are you considering OU maths? Good luck!"
