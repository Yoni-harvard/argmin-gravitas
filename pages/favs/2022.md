<!-- Notes on potato diet

I belatedly joined in on the mad science craze of the summer: eating only potatoes for a month, and as many potatoes as you like.

My version was pretty lax: I allowed myself oil, sweet potatoes, hot sauces, ketchup even. Also omega 3 pills and B12, potassium salt as well as sodium salt.

Still worked! Lost about 4kg in two weeks, maybe about a 1000 kcal daily deficit.

Irish epigenotype coming through

Peeling potatoes stopped indigestion. Solanine?
