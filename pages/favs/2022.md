This year I decided to get into dancing. I actually got into kayaking, gelato, Haskell. I theorised country music. 

This year I quit nicotine. Zyban works! For a while.

## Essays and sites

* [I hope so much this is wrong](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-dawn-of-everything). Used to hate the author but I read this blinded and came out very impressed.
* [The best essay on psychosomatic disease I've ever read.](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/what-long-covid-means/) The key is compassion; he understands that _even when purely mental or "functional neurological"_, disease is real and deserves care. And yet awareness raising and the urge to medicalise seems to have massive costs.
* [One of the best products of the Tumblr Mindset.](https://thenewinquiry.com/hot-allostatic-load/) On the surface it's about transphobia, but this is too narrow.
* [With you other idiots, I have been misreading Omelas for ever.](https://thingofthings.substack.com/p/on-the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas)

<!-- Notes on potato diet

I belatedly joined in on the mad science craze of the summer: eating only potatoes for a month, and as many potatoes as you like.

My version was pretty lax: I allowed myself oil, sweet potatoes, hot sauces, ketchup even. Also omega 3 pills and B12, potassium salt as well as sodium salt.

Still worked! Lost about 4kg in two weeks, maybe about a 1000 kcal daily deficit.

Irish epigenotype coming through

Peeling potatoes stopped indigestion. Solanine?
