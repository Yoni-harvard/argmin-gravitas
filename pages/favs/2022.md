What took so long?” the Sapient Paradox is the prehistoric analog of the Fermi Paradox. Instead of: “Why are we alone in the universe?” the Sapient Paradox asks: “Why were we trapped in prehistory?” And just as the Fermi Paradox implies a Great Filter, the Sapient Paradox implies a Great Trap, a trap in which human society lived for, at minimum, 50,000 years, and, at maximum, something like 200,000 years or even more. Depending on your politics, the Great Trap might be an oppressive patriarchy, or perhaps a decadent matriarchy, or a lazy commune, etc (e.g., Steven Pinker, in The Better Angels of Our Nature, discusses a “Hobbesian trap” of mutual warfare between tribes—although he does not connect this to the Sapient Paradox).

<!-- Notes on potato diet

I belatedly joined in on the mad science craze of the summer: eating only potatoes for a month, and as many potatoes as you like.

My version was pretty lax: I allowed myself oil, sweet potatoes, hot sauces, ketchup even. Also omega 3 pills and B12, potassium salt as well as sodium salt.

Still worked! Lost about 4kg in two weeks, maybe about a 1000 kcal daily deficit.

Peeling potatoes stopped indigestion. Solanine?
