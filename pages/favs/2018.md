## Books

* _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Ignota">Terra Ignota</a>_. The most exciting - and daft! - science fiction I have read in a decade. The only good depiction of longtermism.
* _The Elephant in the Brain_.
* _Lost in Math_. The German title is much, much better: 'The Ugly Universe' or 'The Hateful Universe'.
* _Factfulness_.
* _The Patrick Melrose Novels_.
* _Step Aside, Pops!_
* _Dril Official "Mr Ten Years" Collection_. Distillate of Twitter and Reddit and 4chan, revealing the mess inside.
* _Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets_. I won't say that it is to True Crime what _The Wire_ was to cop procedural tv, but.
* _Blindsight_. Stunningly cynical.
* _The Earthsea Quartet_. Notionally for children, but rich enough for everyone else.
* _Shadow of the Torturer_. Read this as a teen and completely missed what's great about it, the symbolism, the glum glimmers.
* _Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit_, _Joy in the Morning_, _Right Ho, Jeeves_
* _An Encyclopaedia of Myself_
* _A Deepness in the Sky_
* _The Information_ by Martin Amis
* _The Case Against Education_
* _The Sellout_
* _Blindsight_
* _Inadequate Equilibria_

Worst book: _The Four_ by Scott Galloway.

## Films / TV

* _[Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_(TV_series))_. The only Marvel related thing I have ever gotten excited about.
* _The Shape of Water_. A total triumph: romance without words, without physical beauty.
* _Blade Runner 2049_. My friend insists that this has a disgusting bioconservative / pro-life message but I disagree.
* _Eighth Grade_. 
* _Isle of Dogs_. 
* _Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri_. Nasty but undogmatic about it.
* _L'avventura_. I saw this in 2010 and was too immature to appreciate it. It is slow, slow as a motherfucker, but the performances make it sing.
* _Hateful Eight_. First time I've really laughed at a Tarantino film since _Kill Bill_. And he is best as a comic.
* _Upgrade_. Actually new action choreography. Transfixing.
* _The Death of Stalin_
* _Better Call Saul_. Much cleverer spin-off, relying less on spectacle.
* My mate James on _University Challenge_.
* _Adventure Time_. Sniff.
