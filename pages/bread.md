I have published well-received work in epidemiology, philosophy, psychology, economics, and ML. I had no prior background in psychology, epidemiology, or linguistics when I started on the published projects. 

I also have 4 years professional experience in software engineering and data science.

Breadth implies speed: I had a $<$3 month ramp to great publications in epidemiology; I went from zero web dev experience to deploying in prod (2000 pharmacies worldwide) in 2 weeks.
