I once put a lot of effort into classifying my ebooks, as follows. The boring word for this is "typology". The exciting word is <a href="{{archi}}">architectonic</a>. 

(I find classification satisfying, just as I find lists satisfying: one can increase meaning very greatly just by grouping and abstracting. Intellectual labour in low-gravity.)

<div class="accordion">
    <h3>Formal Reality</h3>
    <div>
        {%  include architect/formal.html          %}
    </div>

    <h3>Natural Reality</h3>
    <div>
        {%  include architect/natural.html          %}
    </div>

    <h3>Social Reality</h3>
    <div>
        {%  include architect/social.html          %}
    </div>

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <div>
        {%  include architect/philo.html          %}
    </div>
</div><br>

<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>

    <li class="footnote" id="fn:1">
		When I was a romantic youth building my first architectonic, I put art outside social reality, in "Philosophy and Art". Now, it's true that social criticism is fine art / academic art's default purpose, and has been for a hundred years now. But I no longer think of them as outside.<br><br>

        If I go on this way, I'll probably stop thinking of philosophy above social reality, like a Marxist, dull and confined.

        This doesn't handle the inter-disciplines very well, obviously. Cognitive science is philosophy plus computer science plus psychology, for instance. And parts of the human sciences need to be substantially social.
