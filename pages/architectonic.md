I put a lot of effort into classifying my ebook library once. I find classification satisfying, just as I find lists satisfying: one can increase meaning very greatly just by grouping and abstracting. Intellectual labour in low-gravity. 

The boring word for this is "typology". The exciting word is <a href="{{archi}}">architectonic</a>.

<div class="accordion">
    <h3>Formal Reality</h3>
    <div>
        {%  include architect/formal.html          %}
    </div>

    <h3>Natural Reality</h3>
    <div>
        {%  include architect/natural.html          %}
    </div>

    <h3>Social Reality</h3>
    <div>
        Linguistics
        Art <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>
    </div>

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <div>
    </div>
</div>




<div class="footnotes">
<ol>
    <li class="footnote" id="fn:1">
		When I was a romantic youth building my first architectonic, I put art outside social reality, in "Philosophy and Art". Now, it's true that social criticism is fine/academic art's default semantic level, and has been for a hundred years now. But I no longer think of them as outside.

        A game for one player.
