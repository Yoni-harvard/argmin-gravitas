#### __botany and ultimate reality__

Selection pressures we don't really understand led the deerhorn clarkia to have strangely oblong pollen This increased its fitness for the task of "Robert Brown picking it"

Louis Bachelier modeled the process now called Brownian. Einstein read that. Wiener read that that. Itô read that that that.

The stochastic calculus was made during the war. It describes all random events. that is, it describes

#### __self portrait__


_How did I get here?_

Out of the cave quite easily
- actually a lot of people leave the cave. that whole rebel "cave sucks!!" phase. but it's cold out so you think better. and but right outside is a door you can't push open.

I realised that radicalism does nothing
I realised that bureaucracy does nothing
I realised that government is bureaucracy
I was treated unjustly by social justice and made to not imagine i have no enemies

- I realised that books are small and art is small and secondary and phantomish I realised that there is a way out of the cage of philosophy I realised that science too does almost nothing

<br>

_Why so hard to work on what I should?_

Of course it hurts! I am giving birth

as well as lifting the object I am also carrying myself on my back

<br>

_What am I?_

I am not a grounder, a tower builder, an explorer, an astronaut, a rotator
I am a
    -   sprinter
    -   thought experimentalist
    - association engine
    - mascot
    - expositor
        - ladderman. dragging the ladder down for others
    - curator
        - eddington. thresher. searcher. finder.
    - poet

of science

#### __fancy__


My nation is a dress uniform, like all nations. Distinctive, colourful, old, mass-produced. Six sizes too big. If I wear it I am legible to you, you I haven't met. It veils me when I meet you and don't want to be met by you. It lives in the cupboard (I don't have to meet many people). <br>

It's usually nice to own it - something to don when surrounded by notional barbarians, to set myself apart in my different barbarism. <br>

Though often people point to it, saying that I <i>am</i> my frock coat, or that I'm wearing my frock coat when I'm not wearing it. This isn't fun, as no forced game is fun. At least my coat isn't caked in shit and blood, like yours. (Like all coats, it <i>is</i> caked in shit and blood, but at least mine isn't on the outside.)<br>

Like all regiments, my regiment thinks it is special: not many people have these coats. But wearing any coat makes you less rare: you leave your kingdom singly for a low foothold on Leviathan.<br>

No one will spit on my coat, unlike yours. It is humble and demotic. The regiment's crimes were quiet, or loud with none left to say. <br>

Frock coats are new. There are no frock coats, we just pretend we're wearing frock coats to humour each other. It is cold without them. But it it wouldn't be, if you stood like so before yours, as it burned. Say, can you see?

#### __Firebrand__
<!-- April 22, 2013 -->

> So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of Eden...<br>a flaming sword which turned every way,<br>to keep the way of the tree of life.

-- Genesis 3:24

<br>

there's something wrong with everything<br>
in this post-lapsarian land.<br>
standing east of what he thinks is eden<br>
stands the fire brand.<br>

ward me, terrible agent;<br>
stop up our eden's ears,<br>
justice itself, flame-left-long,<br>
withstand lyrical jeers.<br>

no anchor put to windward<br>
no philosophy onstage;<br>
many men, falling foully,<br>
all phonelines engaged.<br>

Consider the Menshevik; recall the wet,<br>
Ta Thu Thau the Girondin,<br>
dispensed-with, soon-null sets.<br>
so too next time, I bet.

#### __Who Am I?__
<!-- Jan 2010 -->

> "It's easy hatin yourself, it's hard makin it rhyme"

<br>
 
I am the word made flesh (lowly CTAGCCGATCATT)

DNA is a candle and I am is so much

evaporating wax

I'm words and words are dancers

Flowing over their ink

Under their maybe-meanings.

I'll never be there for anyone if I don't

somehow stay still.

Everything anyone's 

Ever said about me

is true.

In my forced condescension, my needy generosity,

false modesty, false arrogance

"I gave my heart before I knew what it was"

organs it attached to.

Not informed of hands nor feet,

I shattered your fingers. It'll happen.

I am a clenched fist in glass gloves,

an intellect insinuating; a missing accent.

I am a grasping heaving frowner;

the dissatisfied have always been on top,

we tutters, bleeders, wankers. What thinking!<br>

I dance to a ceased tune.

You to an unwritten one.

#### __home school__
<!-- Feb 2010 -->

needing parental permission slip signed to read Sophocles.<br>
Near world, well-meaning, nominally <br>
the diversity of parental belief. <br>
how many years the instantiated? very little goes away. <br>
How much of me was decided has branded itself on my mind in my hand. <br>
When parents die early I will not need to; the begetter's whim  <br>
Shall I ask my ailing father if I may when I am 50? <br>
When my children ask me, will I pass their request upwards?

<br><br><br>


#### __35%__
<!-- Feb 2010 -->

I have been told of things. Almost everything in my head I have been told; of an a passive brickie, handed material (begrodying study and expected to conclude as I should. 

Some of the things recently mortared-in are in are destructive tellings, however. They undermine and pry, never settle and never dry. Possible worlds. Idealism. Imperceptibles. Anarchic science and slave moralities.

Philosophy is a downpour on the construction site, or maybe it only reveals the rain.

Children of one multiply-sclerotic parent have a 35% chance of themselves presenting in later listen. I am told.

#### __I'll Hill Your Head__
<!-- 11/11/09 -->


Ascendent though light pollution. <br>
A canopy of youth, snug in subzero. <br>
River runneth rare; <br>
a brook of the world's <br>
bright drunkard snowmelt <br>
intermixed, tributary. <br>
A tropic of the North<br>
and movement in the undergrowth <br><br>
Descend by skyhook and bitten tongue

#### __Timepoem 1: Independence Overrated (6/10/07)__

_Being a minute-by-minute account of a shy lad with pretensions travelling to the Edinburgh University Open Day, and there enjoying a psychotic moment_

_5:19_ Lurch bleary to action <br>
My matter creaking his hello <br>
to my me and the absent sun. 

_5:22_ Crime scene vacated, <br>
prelim premortem <br>
sanguine as my smug blood. 

_5:26_ Shower, and but with all<br> 
exaggerated care <br>
make a lot of fucking noise. 

_5:40_ Breakfast remorselessly <br>
sitting in a heathen lotus <br>
Leering indictments askance.

_6:05_ Invidious from waking <br>
and rediscovering my adolescence <br>
I throw the door to percussion 

_6:10_ I'm pacified by the desert, urban, <br>
with its sunrise I don't have to share <br>
and its thrumming quasi-silence 

People walking this morning-tundra are novelties & civilities: <br>
we are collective in our solitudes, <br>
we swarm single-handed. 

I nod to each I pass <br>
which is a truly rural few we swarm 

_6:13_ Newsagent, bored, kicking his bins <br>
I'd join but there's bus to grasp

_6:20_ Dissension, tension! <br>
the awful confound and snicker <br>
of timetables misread. 

_6:24_ The bus stance putsch fails <br>
& I certainly have not rhetoric enough <br>
to force leeway. 

_6:40_. On en route en bus; <br>
I write without pause, uncertainty, <br>
point 

I would bottle this state of mind <br>
hoard it in an affective cellar for faltering times

_7:30_ The obese light rolls up the line <br>
& my spidery spread <br>
forgets even music of me.

_8:30_ Dundee, where we flit and <br>
nestle away from the chilling <br>
fact of where we've stopped.  

_8:51_ Merely overtaking default <br>
disdain, hooded discomfiture <br>
is gratuitous excitement. 

_9:52_ Edinburgh arrives at me. <br>
Too much depends on my <br>
love for a city, any port or toun. <br>
_9:54_ I hit the ice crown-first: <br>
No North; can't visualise; <br>
stomp circular and gnaw lip 

help ma boab! <br>
unquantified, unmapped and <br>
disparate dan.<br>
distress comes defcon <br>
and my face changes colour <br>
though mostly broken green. 

_10:10_ I ask, I throw upon mercies <br>
my Kingdom til I'm hoarse; <br>
Wherefore wherefore aight. 

Many shields are millstones too <br>
My silent panic is a stupidity <br>
that I cannot mask to you: 

I pulled ahead, though it was <br>
not meant to strand me or <br>
to behind you. (wrong track wrong speed) <br>
In short; why didn't I bring a map?

_10:22_ - Breathe, & try not to look so creepy <br>
"Um – sorry - but are you going to the university?" <br>
Yeahmeandmydadaretryingtofindit


<br>
