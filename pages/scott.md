A. Argument and Analysis

1. Eight Short Studies On Excuses
	If you don't precommit properly, you can be exploited.
	Hard to really precommit; circumstances change, special cases impossible to foresee, forgiveness is good.
	If you don't follow through on your threats the pre-commitment won't be credible anymore.
	By accepting an excuse, a rule-maker is committing to accepting all equally good future excuses.
	You usually don't know if an excuse is true and the excusee is pure of heart. So you need general rules.

	What kinds of excuses "should" be valid?: 
		deontological: "ick" reaction, 
		consequentialist: how will behavior change if society deems [excuse] valid? 
							how many equivalent cases are enabled?


	* The Clumsy Game-Player: one-off, "accidental" defection. Respond by one-off forgiveness.
		you wish that you'd pre-committed, at the beginning, to saying "I punish slips equally to deliberate defections, so be careful."


	* The Lazy Student: Be provocable. Acausal character instantiation.
		"if I let you get away with this, the other students will turn in their reports late."
		"If I ever do this again or ever tell anyone, change my grade to a fail. So passing me won't affect anything in the future. So you have no reason not to do it." 
		You believe her when she says she'll never tell, but you say "You made this argument because you believed me to be the sort of person who would accept it. In order to prevent other people from making the same argument, I have to be the sort of person who wouldn't accept it. To that end, I'm going to not accept your argument."


	* The Grieving Student: Grief exception is not (sensibly) hackable. 
		"if you grant this extension, no moral hazard: no extensions unless they kill their own mothers.
		if you don't grant the extension, no extra reports on-time. rather attend mother's funeral than pass a course, so you won't be successfully motivating anyone else."


	* The Sports Fan
		"It's very rare that there's a game on this important, and not many students here are sports fans anyway. You'll probably never see a student with this excuse again."
		"By accepting your excuse, I set a precedent of accepting excuses approximately this good. Practically anyone can come up with an excuse as good as yours, so if I accept your late report, I have to accept everyone's. We have an ordering in which a family member's funeral is one of the most important things around. By accepting her excuse, I'm establishing a precedent of accepting any excuse approximately that good, but almost no one will ever have an excuse that good."


	* The Murderous Husband
		Crime of passion, no future risk.
		"But other people will be in the position you were in. Society needs a credible pre-commitment to punishing them if they succumb to rage, to deter them from murder."
		"You can't possibly understand the rage. No matter how bad the deterrent, you'd still kill the guy."
		"I can't believe anyone could ever be that irrational. But I'll give you a lighter sentence."
		(This is true.)

	
	* The Bellicose Dictator
		UN: any country that invades a neighbor will be severely punished with sanctions.
		One day, enemy accidentally crosses border. You immediately declare war, and take the capital.
		UN: "They were lost and you know it!"
		You: "The UN needs a credible pre-commitment to punish aggressive countries, or everyone will invade their weaker neighbors. What you'd really like to do is let us off, but in a way that doesn't make other countries think they'll get off too. There's no international law against being stupid. If you dismiss us as misled, you don't have to go through the trouble of punishing us, and other countries won't think they can get away with anything. Nor do you need to live in fear of us doing something like this again. We've already demonstrated that we won't go to war without cause. If other countries can refrain from giving us one, they have nothing to fear."
		the countries that would bear the sanctions decide they believe it just enough to stay uninvolved.


The Peyote-Popping Native

		You are the governor of a state with a large Native American population. You have banned all mind-altering drugs, with the honorable exceptions of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and several others, because you are a red-blooded American who believes that they would drive teenagers to commit crimes.

		A representative of the state Native population comes to you and says: "Our people have used peyote religiously for hundreds of years. During this time, we haven't become addicted or committed any crimes. Please grant us a religious exemption under the First Amendment to continue practicing our ancient rituals." You agree.

		A leader of your state's atheist community breaks into your office via the ventilation systems (because seriously, how else is an atheist leader going to get access to a state governor?) and says: "As an atheist, I am offended that you grant exemptions to your anti-peyote law for religious reasons, but not for, say, recreational reasons. This is unfair discrimination in favor of religion. The same is true of laws that say Sikhs can wear turbans in school to show support for God, but my son can't wear a baseball cap in school to show support for the Yankees. Or laws that say Muslims can get time off state jobs to pray five times a day, but I can't get time off my state job for a cigarette break. Or laws that say state functions will include special kosher meals for Jews, but not special pasta meals for people who really like pasta."

		You respond "Although my policies may seem to be saying religion is more important than other potential reasons for breaking a rule, one can make a non-religious case justifying them. One important feature of major world religions is that their rituals have been fixed for hundreds of years. Allowing people to break laws for religious reasons makes religious people very happy, but does not weaken the laws. After all, we all know the few areas in which the laws of the major US religions as they are currently practiced conflict with secular law, and none of them are big deals. So the general principle 'I will allow people to break laws if it is necessary to established and well-known religious rituals" is relatively low-risk and makes people happy without threatening the concept of law in general. But the general principle 'I will allow people to break laws for recreational reasons' is very high risk, because it's sufficient justification for almost anyone breaking any law."

		"I would love to be able to serve everyone the exact meal they most wanted at state dinners. But if I took your request for pasta because you liked pasta, I would have to follow the general principle of giving everyone the meal they most like, which would be prohibitively expensive. By giving Jews kosher meals, I can satisfy a certain particularly strong preference without being forced to satisfy anyone else's."

The Well-Disguised Atheist

		The next day, the atheist leader comes in again. This time, he is wearing a false mustache and sombrero. "I represent the Church of Driving 50 In A 30 Mile Per Hour Zone," he says. "For our members, going at least twenty miles per hour over the speed limit is considered a sacrament. Please grant us a religious exemption to traffic laws."

		You decide to play along. "How long has your religion existed, and how many people do you have?" you ask.

		"Not very long, and not very many people," he responds.

		"I see," you say. "In that case, you're a cult, and not a religion at all. Sorry, we don't deal with cults."

		"What, exactly, is the difference between a cult and a religion?"

		"The difference is that cults have been formed recently enough, and are small enough, that we are suspicious of them existing for the purpose of taking advantage of the special place we give religion. Granting an exemption for your cult would challenge the credibility of our pre-commitment to punish people who break the law, because it would mean anyone who wants to break a law could just found a cult dedicated to it."

		"How can my cult become a real religion that deserves legal benefits?"

		"You'd have to become old enough and respectable enough that it becomes implausible that it was created for the purpose of taking advantage of the law."

		"That sounds like a lot of work."

		"Alternatively, you could try writing awful science fiction novels and hiring a ton of lawyers. I hear that also works these days."
