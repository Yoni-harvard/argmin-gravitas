<div style="padding:20px">
	I'm Gavin Leech, a data scientist at the giant insurer <a href="{{Axa}}">AXA</a> <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>. I write prose and software about things like <a href="{{welf}}">the unit of caring</a>, <a href="{{cs}}">quantitative epistemology</a>, and the <a href="{{stat}}">applied philosophy of science</a>. 

	I don't think of this as a blog (I see blogging as more like speech than writing).<br><br>

	You can contact me by <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> or anonymously <a href="{{Form}}">here</a>.

		I'm a member of <a href="{{GWWC}}">Giving What We Can</a>, people who pledge substantial amounts of their lifetime income to the most effective charitable causes. I'm donating <a href="{{MyGiving}}">10% this year</a>, aiming at 50% overall <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>. My reasoning on the most important causes, and my present basket of charities is forthcoming.<br><br><br>

		I am cause-neutral (in the sense that I will support whatever is highest value, to the extent that objective evaluation is possible) and cause-sceptical (in the sense that we don't really know what the best thing to do is).
